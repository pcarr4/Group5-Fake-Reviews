5044,0,1,0,11/16/2014,"Drinks were bad, the hot chocolate was watered down and the latte had a burnt taste to it. The food was also poor quality, but the service was the worst part, their cashier was very rude."
5045,0,1,0,9/8/2014,"This was the worst experience I've ever had a casual coffee/light fare place. ˜The server disappeared for 20 minutes, just talking to his friend by the window as my girlfriend and I sat dumbfounded that this dude had the nerve to do that on the job. ˜We're trying to make eye contact, but clearly getting paid to talk to his bud was more important to him. My girlfriend went up to the counter once the server disappeared into the back for another 5 minutes (what is this guy doing?) and asked if she should order food up there or something. ˜The girl at the counter gives her a weird look and just says ""I'll get your server."" ˜When they arrive from the back, they look over at our table and have a laugh. ˜Yeah, leaving us hanging for half-a-goddamn hour at a place with only two other customers is not funny - but in retrospect, your collective incompetence and false sense of entitlement certainly was. The food was okay. ˜For a place called ""toast,"" I'd figured the bread would be better, but it was just cold Le Bus. ˜Additionally, I'm 95% sure the ""andouille"" in my special was just a link of the pre-packaged offering from Trader Joe's cut into four pieces. ˜$9 for unapologetic mediocrity will not be happening again. Avoid this place like the plague. ˜I almost didn't leave a tip, and honestly I shouldn't have. ˜I felt the buyer's remorse all day. ˜What a disgrace."
5046,0,3,0,10/6/2013,"This is located on the site of the old Spruce St. Video. ˜The mild cofee is very good and the pastris are great. ˜At times, the service is slow even when it is not busy and at other times some patrons receive a complimentary mimosa drink. ˜The WIFI is good."
5047,0,5,0,11/30/2014,"I enjoyed coffee and breakfast twice at Toast during my recent visit to Philly. The first morning I enjoyed the Omelette du Jour which had a savory filling of roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, and wilted spinach. It was accompanied by a crisp small side salad of baby greens, tomato, and berries. The house dressing was light and complementary, not at all over powering. I just HAD to complement the chef. The barista recommended a pour over coffee and it did not disappoint. He prepared my cup with care and attention to time and form. I followed the pour over with a wonderful latte, again prepared very well. As I was leaving town, I decided to visit again for breakfast before my long trip ahead. This breakfast was a delicious Eggs Benedict combo that was perfectly done and complemented by mushrooms, roast tomato, and a generous helping of wilted greens. A rich cup of melted butter accompanied the dish and the sweet side salad again brought balance to my meal. This time the barista made me a perfect cup of French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It was balanced and bright, yet rich in flavor. I had to have a second cup to go! Cudos to the barista, chef, and friendly staff. Toast is definitely a place to visit, eat, and enjoy coffee prepared in a variety ways. Don't miss this one!"
5048,0,5,0,8/28/2014,"I love Toast! The food choices are fantastic - I love that they serve brunch all day, and their coffee is well brewed and prepared. I'm a fan of the large windows - it's the perfect location to sit and people watch for a little while. Nestled in Center City, Toast provides people like me who travel into the city for work a little haven to de-stress and kick back a little bit. The staff is wonderfully friendly and always eager to provide their own suggestions when you're not sure what to get. ˜Now that school is starting back up it also makes it the perfect environment to settle down and do some studying. I love the fact that they play Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's - and related Pandora stations - it really sets the mood to unwind or have casual conversation with some friends. Can't wait to go back!"
5049,0,5,0,7/16/2013,"The egg on an English muffin (their take on eggs Benedict) was fantastic. Service was quick and pleasant. They have multiple roasters providing their coffee and the barista knew how to make a good cup. They have a La Marzocco Strada for espresso and then you can choose between a Chemex, French Press, or Fetco for filter coffee. There was plenty of seating, it's well lot, and comfortable. Free wifi available. Good stuff."
5050,0,5,0,3/3/2013,wonderful relaxed vibe and fantastic homemade English muffins. best Earl Grey tea in Center City.....looking forward to the outdoor seating in the Spring. friendly and helpful staff are a delight!
5051,0,1,1,12/5/2014,"Extremely slow kitchen. I went with an hour to eat before my shift and told the server that information as well. I got canned fruit and an omelette over 45 minutes later. I boxed it and left. About 2 weeks later I was waiting for quick hem and asked for the fastest thing they could make, bagel and cream cheese was the answer. That took over 15 minutes. Don't come here with any time constraints."
5052,0,2,1,11/26/2014,"I really wanted to love toast. It's quaint and cozy, and it was a perfect place to hop on a call while on my layover in Philadelphia. I figured I'd get a latte and some food while there. The latte was upwards of $4 for a small. I also ordered a turkey sausage grilled cheese, which I believe was around $10. We sat down and availed ourselves to the free wifi (great perk) while waiting for our food, which came within 15 mins. I took a bite of my crunchy grilled cheese, which was basically the size of a wonder bread slice, and was immediately horrified. This is not a grilled cheese with turkey sausage; this is a fucking abomination. I spread the sandwich and there was ONE slice of cheese on it--it was so dry that it wasn't even gooey or sticky. Also, there was ONE turkey sausage link that was sliced in half and spread diagonally across the sandwich. I would say that approximately 70% of the sandwich was turkey-less. The server happened to be nearby so my boyfriend said something about how the grilled cheese had no cheese...and he happily took it back and made a new one, with more cheese and the same amount of turkey sausage. It was a nice gesture but honestly, it's highway robbery to serve that sandwich and charge $10 for it. At the very most that sandwich costs $2 to make...and I'm including the side of salad greens. Overall, toast needs to step up their game. A little less stingy with the cheese, Some small tweaks to the menu, and slightly more reasonable prices, and the place would be great."
5053,0,4,1,11/17/2014,"First brunch experience here in Philly (actually in my entire life), and oh man, I can see why now brunch is such a thing. My friends and I initially planned on Green Eggs Caf?, but because we would have had to wait 45 minutes for a table, we came here instead. Not only did the waitress seat us quickly, but the place also provided a very toasty ambience. (No pun intended.) I ordered a plate of their special egg toast: two poached eggs served atop a homemade split English muffin, with smoked salmon and asaparagus on the side. (I opted out of the Hollandaise sauce.) O-M-G. While I didn't get that runny yolk porn experience, each bite was a delicious sensation of salty and savory. Also, that English muffin was on point - so chewy and carb-y. I definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch minus the the terribly long line."
5054,0,3,1,10/20/2014,"Coffee is great and I live close so it's convenient! I've been here a handful of times but only eaten there twice. Their homemade English muffins are delish! I had mine with some jam. I've also had their avocado toast. It's poached eggs on homemade bread and alfalfa sprouts with plenty of avocado on the side. It comes with a side salad as well. It's really good but heavy on the alfalfa sprouts, I took most of them off and it was just fine after that! Their setup is nice, but windows, plenty of seating and even a handful of plugs if you want to do some work, which I appreciate. Their service leaves something to be desired though. Weekdays they only have counter service, which is understandable because most people are there to work while they have coffee and probably don't want to be bothered but still, some attention would be nice. I had to find my own utensils etc and the girl at the counter completely forgot that I was the one that was waiting for food, after only a few minutes. I'm all for good customer service so that was a little disappointing but I will still go for coffee and pastries. For a neighborhood that has tons of coffee shops this one is pretty good!"
5055,0,5,1,10/13/2014,"My family and I found this hidden gem while we were looking for a place to park and get some breakfast after traveling all day. We loved everything! The space is cute. The food was amazing! The juice and coffee were nice and fresh! We were impressed with Alex, the guy who took our order at the counter, delivered our food to our table, he also cleared other tables and seem to keep the line at the counter moving pretty fast!!! He manage all of these different jobs very efficiently and with a smile and a great personality! When we are in the area again, we will be sure to visit again!!!"
5056,0,5,1,10/7/2014,So many great things to say about this place . They are open early!! That's the first draw if you need to get some work done before your day starts. They have great drinks and the food is really good too. Plenty of space sit with huge windows so you can look outside as you work. Perfect ambience with light music that is soothing and not distracting. The staff was incredibly friendly and responsive. Absolutely nothing to complain about I hope this place sticks around for a long time. Oh also they bring your food and drinks to you! So you can order and sit down and set up your work or chat with a friend without having to stand in a line (not that there would be a line because they are so quick).
5057,0,2,1,10/6/2014,".. I wanted to love this place... I stopped by for brunch as i found it while roaming. I was excited for the omelette of the day but did not receive it. The staff was friendly, the tea was good. The omelette was just not tasty. Not sure if it was lack of technique of cooking or lack of seasoning but the spinach tasted really bad. Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Location; 4/5 - Super cure place. Nice and chill"
5058,0,5,1,9/22/2014,"The coffee is just better hear than all of the options in the area, I now actually walk out of my way to just get my iced lattes here. The food is pretty darn tasty too."
5059,0,5,1,9/22/2014,Toast was very good for breakfast when you want something hearty but not to filling. There egg toast (pretty much eggs Benedict) is very good and they have it in many different forms. I had the egg toast with avocado and my wife had the one with salmon. I'm not a huge fish guy but she said it was very good.
5060,0,5,1,9/11/2014,"Great Location, Love the vibe, food and love the service, highly recommended!!!"
5061,0,4,1,9/10/2014,"Toast is a comfortable and artistic environment with good food and very affordable prices. You can spend under $5 on a home made English muffin and coffee or go for a larger plate for under $15. My chia tea was brewed on site instead of from a mix (hooray!) and exceptionally creamy. My truffled egg sandwich was just the right portion and had fresh salad on the side with strawberries. They have huge windows that flood the space with light. The decor is cosy meets sculptural with mismatched pillows and modern artistic lighting. Our check came delightfully attached to a giant clothespin. It was early when I went, so there was not a crowd, but the staff was friendly, and fast."
5062,0,5,1,9/8/2014,"I stopped into Toast on my way to work to use my pc ˜and decided to try ˜the eggs benedict ˜as i was hungry and had some time to kill....What a surprise !This was by far the very best EB""'s ˜I've had in this city so far. They use real baked ˜ham and have a wonderful salad rather than the usual home fries as the side.. ˜Ive been back many times since then and have not been disappointed yet. ˜A+ ps - the ˜english muffins are home made too boot!"
5063,0,2,1,8/30/2014,"Toast is ok. My goat cheese, tomato and spinach omelet was actually pretty good and the coffee was pretty good too. I had the hummus plate and the hummus was pretty good. But it's kind of expensive and although it's pretty good it's not great. Which is the whole thing. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it but it's just not exciting in any way. I was kind of pissed that they wouldn't make my kid a plain omelette though when clearly they are capable of doing so. Weird. Nice space."
5064,0,2,1,8/19/2014,Really didn't see any vegan items on the menu. Soy milk wasn't even listed as an option on the board. I got a decent soy cappuccino but I have had better. I don't need to go here again.
5065,0,5,1,8/5/2014,The Toast of town!
5066,0,2,1,8/4/2014,"NOISE! Good food, OK coffee, moderate price but much too noisy from a terrible heating/AC system to enjoy a peaceful meal."
5067,0,5,1,8/1/2014,"Fantastic time at Toast! The omelet of the day had spinach, goat cheese and Capri tomatoes--Yum! Spritzers were fab and the perfect quencher for a warm day. I also had a bowl of fresh fruit and unlike some caf?s the fruit was FRESH! It hadn't been in the fridge dying an icy death but perfect strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and banana. My kids (3 x 13y + 1(24y) 1 gal pal (13y)) ate everything on their plates and want to return. Above all the service was wonderful!"
5068,0,4,1,7/30/2014,"I would give toast 3.5 stars, but it is not an option, so I'll round up to 4. ˜The food is pretty good, although very basic. Their menu doesn't have tons of options. The place fills up quickly on weekends, but if you come here during a weekday afternoon you can study or get some work done. ˜I felt that their french toast tasted kind of plain and they didn't have scrambled eggs on the menu (at a brunch place?!?), but perhaps that has changed since the last time I went there. ˜I highly recommend their spritzers. They are yummy and refreshing on a hot day."
5069,0,4,1,7/23/2014,"Solid little tea selection here, plus they carry sip n' glo juices (they are expensive, but good)! ˜The hours are very convenient, too (Monday to Friday 7-7 and Saturday/Sunday 8-6). ˜The hummus wrap looked delightful, but sadly, I wasn't hungry enough when I stopped in. ˜I will definitely be back to try it and will update accordingly!"
5070,0,4,1,6/29/2014,"Toast has the potential to be amazing - the food was excellent as was the coffee, but the service is lacking. Came here with two of my friends for brunch on a Sunday. We were seated immediately and though our host wasn't friendly, he wasn't rude either. I'm a hostess though and he could've done A LOT better. Anyway, my friends ordered lattes and I ordered a double shot of espresso. It took 20 minutes to receive our coffee..For food, sure, 20 minutes is fast, but just to receive our drinks?! Did I miss something? It wasn't even crowded, so I have no idea why it took that long. If it were crowded, I'd understand a little more. When we did get our food and drinks, everything was good, so no complaints there! Friendlier wait-staff and better service would make this place 5-stars. Toast is cute and has great food, but don't be in a rush when you go!"
5071,0,1,1,5/20/2014,"AWFUL! Had half an hour to kill this a.m. so bypassed Capogiro to go here as had read good things about it. What a mistake!! First the girl working at the counter barely acknowledged me. When she did -made no eye contact, made me wait as was on the phone. When she finally waited on me whispered and was impossible to hear over the god awful fan racket coming from the kitchen. I then waited almost 10 mins to get my capp - I was the ONLY one waiting. ˜When i finally did get it was not very hot. The fan noise from the kitchen was deafening and the whole place reeked of old sandwiches and curry, I think. Couldn't leave fast enough. SO not the relaxing cup of coffee i was hoping for. When I left my clothes smelled of curry or something. It was just awful. Angry at myself for going out of my way for such an unpleasant experience. Only good thing was the croissant (which am sure came from elsewhere)."
5072,0,4,1,4/18/2014,"Finally got to try Toast after passing by many times. It didnt quite live up to my expectations hence the 4 star rating, but it was still nice! Came for brunch around noon and the place was almost full. The ambience is great - it has a clean yet rustic feel between the white floors/metallic light fixtures contrasting to the wooden tables/chairs. We got the hot chocolate and the blue lady black tea. The cups are quite big, hot choc was delicious not overly chocolatey and the was fruity and refreshing. We both got the ""egg toasts"" - avocado and truffled mushroom. I agree with another yelper that the avocado could have been fresher and the dishes could have used a little flavor (garlic, salt, onions etc) - adding a little hot sauce helped. My boyfriend's poached egg turned out to be a fully cooked egg which was dissapointing because we waited awhile for our order (5-10 minutes to get our drink order in and another 20 for our food). But the salad was surprisingly good - lightly dressed with a good balance of veggies and fruits. Our server was friendly and apologized for the wait a few times. Overall - the service was a bit slow and the food a bit bland (for my personal taste) but the staff were friendly and the ambience was great. Probably will come back for a drink sometime instead!!"
5073,0,5,1,4/9/2014,"I love this place for its coffeeshop feel without being a coffee shop. It's a great place to study with high ceilings and giant windows so it feels spacious without having that much square footage. Their internet is fast and they have a little bar for those of us who like to occasionally stand and study. While the service is a little slow, it's not ridiculous and most of the baristas are very friendly. I haven't had a negative experience here yet. The food is delicious. They have omelettes and toast related things, and soups along with their coffees and teas so I can literally be here all day as long as it's not too busy and never have to leave. I'm a fan of the veggie chili and their occasional wrap, but still have to try more off the menu."
5074,0,5,1,3/30/2014,"I think this is one of the cutest coffee shops ever. ˜Visiting for just a night and staying across the street and been here twice already. ˜I am from NY, so to some of the other comments, nothing is expensive compared. ˜Would definitely stop by."
5075,0,5,1,3/15/2014,"I've come here now a couple of times and I love this place. Coffee is good, service is quick and food is good. I got the lox Benedict before and it was delicious. Cute little place to go to on the weekends. We also didn't have much of a wait for coming on a Sunday which is kind of unheard of in Philly. I will definitely come back!"
5076,0,1,1,3/12/2014,"On Sunday, I ordered a soy caramel latte. They were out of caramel, and vanilla, so I settled on a mocha and paid. The employees then just realized they were out of soy milk. It happens, but the way they handled it... They were completely unphased and unapologetic. Just a refund and then a ""k cya"". I'm convinced customer service is dead in this city and my recent experience at Toast reaffirmed that."
5077,0,1,1,2/20/2014,"Toast, you're killing me. I've tried many times to like this place since I live so close to it, but its just one disappointment after another. The prices are just oddly absurd. I got a small coffee and a tiny muffin (about 1-2 inches in diameter) and it came out to almost $6! Not to mention the muffin had absolutely no flavor to it and was kind of stale. I hate to feel such regret after making a purchase but it's happened a few times at Toast now. They only get my business out of convenience when the weather is too gross to go somewhere farther."
5078,0,4,1,2/19/2014,"Excellent breakfast spot, with very good coffee, and of course, wonderful toast!"
5079,0,5,1,2/16/2014,"Toast is a shockingly good breakfast place. ˜Their sandwich board outside always seems to be advertising tea or desserts, but breakfast or brunch is really where it's at. On the low end, they do restaurant-quality egg sandwiches at food truck prices. The rest of the menu is quite small, but I think it was designed by some sort of restaurant-managing genius, because every item I've tried is basically the best I've ever eaten. Wilted greens egg toast? ˜The plate is beautifully and deliciously covered with greens and mushrooms, the homemade muffins are crispy and perfect, and the hollandaise is excellent. ˜Hummus plate? ˜I didn't expect much, but it was actually amazing -- the highlight is their salted bagel chips, which are somehow both crunchy and chewy. ˜And I've never had a better yogurt parfait anywhere: the chewy honey granola is perfect, they use plain Pequea Valley yogurt which is already my favorite, and the thing is just loaded with berries."
5080,0,2,1,2/10/2014,"WTF SURLY BARISTA? ˜When I stumble in at 7am, I expect you to at least smile. ˜When I ask if you have green tea, don't be an ass and sigh and say ""only like FIVE"" and then not give me any advice. ˜I don't know shit about green tea! Also, your red eye last time stunk. BOOOO HISS."
5081,0,4,1,2/2/2014,"really awesome neighborhood cafe. staff is very friendly and helpful. my waiter put me in the best corner spot to do work for a few hours. coffee and food are pretty decent and so are their prices. i will be incorporating this spot into my brunch cycle. really love the soundtrack too--belle & sebastian, modest mouse, lots of shins."
5082,0,4,1,1/25/2014,"Overall, a good cappuccino. ˜Strong coffee flavor, with a smoky aftertaste. ˜I normally prefer a more creamy consistency, with a sour tinge at the end, but I didn't much mind the taste of Toast's cappuccino. ˜Verging on $4 territory, it's a pricey drink. ˜Although I didn't sample, the fold menu looked intriguing. ˜Also, went on a cold day and the seating area was the opposite of toasty. ˜Worth the visit though."
5083,0,4,1,1/20/2014,"Came here for brunch and it was very good. Friendly staff, food arrived in a timely manner. I love how Toast supports the local art community by featuring work from local artists."
5084,0,4,1,1/16/2014,"Just moved into the neighborhood and I'm very happy to have this little cafe just a block away. The barista was friendly, the atmosphere quiet and relaxing and very inviting. The kitchen was closed tonight so I'll hold off that fifth star till I try the food, but this is definitely a spot you should visit. My cappuccino is delicious and artfully made."
5085,0,5,1,1/16/2014,"Wonderful. Just wonderful. I will walk, cycle, and train long distances for a well made cappuccino with a cozy place to sit and work. When they offer some sort of whole grain option for quick breakfast (bagels, oatmeal), all the better. When the staff is polite and sweet and courteous and skilled---I fall in love. Seriously happy about Toast. I'll enjoy coming here weekday mornings to write (it's so quiet during this time!). And it's just a short 2-block walk from the 12th/Locust PATCO speedline station (I live in Collingswood). Expertly crafted soymilk cappuccino and pumpernickel bagel was $5.50, plus $1.00 tip (baristas deserve tips, too!)."
5086,0,3,1,1/15/2014,"Nice vibes, just ok food and not too warm service. Good prices but not much food for it."
5087,0,5,1,1/9/2014,I. Love. Toast. My favorite Caf? to study in...also my favorite green tea and eggs benny toast.
5088,0,2,1,12/31/2013,"I've been in once. The coffee is fine. The hot line is a nice change from most of the Philly cafes, but I didn't like their basic egg sandwich---it was quite dry. Service was slow, but their was only one barista working. (At 9am on a weekday... ouch! I didn't envy him.)"
5089,0,4,1,12/12/2013,Great atmosphere and great coffee!
5090,0,1,1,12/8/2013,"this place upon walking in smelled like a pan of burnt bacon. it was overpowering. no exhaust? the staff was not so welcoming and seemed as though the couch area was their break room. eating, hanging out. there was even a mop bucket stored out in the open where customers could sit next to and eat by, if the couch wasn't taken up by employees that is. the cup of coffee was good. hours later my garments still smell like a 4 day old burnt cast iron skillet. blah."
5091,0,3,1,11/25/2013,Great food and drinks. Fresh salads and sandwiches with quality ingredients. Good service and atmosphere. Sometimes there is a wait because it is small.
5092,0,3,1,11/23/2013,"Great but expensive coffee. Their large is only a 16oz for $3. Not much variety with the to-go food. When you walk in, you don't know whether to seat yourself or have a hostess seat you. This is awkward if you don't want waiter service and are coming in for a quick bite or to catch up on some work. English muffins are amazing along with the homemade jam."
5093,0,5,1,11/21/2013,"Toast has expanded their ˜menu offerings since my original review. The daily specials they've added make for more interesting options. I also like that the food is generally healthy, with right sized portions and fair prices to go with them. They've been able to make the most of the small kitchen space, earning themselves another star from me."
5094,0,5,1,11/12/2013,"This is a really nice place to get hot chocolate if you are near 12th and spruce. It's fast and convenient and affordable. I come here a lot since my brother apartment is close to it, it's the next building to it. So far I've tried their hot chocolate which nine times out of ten I would get instead of coffee, I've seen their food menu but haven't tried anything yet the only i tried was a small macaroon which is very good so airy and very tasty."
5095,0,2,1,11/9/2013,"Came for breakfast with a few people and service was lacking! Took a while for anyone to acknowledge us. Once seated, we waited so long that I got up and grabbed menus for my table. The waitress/host was nice enough, but too busy. Homemade English muffins are very dry!!! I ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, and bacon. Bacon was good, but the whole sandwich was so dry. My friend received the wrong order and they said they could re-do it, but it would take 15 minutes. We already waited long enough for 4 breakfast sandwiches. Coffee and tea was good. Relaxed ambiance is nice. I would not return unless you have a lot of time to waste and like dry sandwiches."
5096,0,4,1,11/4/2013,"I'm giving these guys 4 stars, but really it's a 3.5. ˜Ate brunch with my boyfriend yesterday and was overall super happy with everything, although there were some blips they could work out to be full 5-star material. ˜First, I was served my delicious hot coffee in a cute mug - with no milk or sugar or even a spoon. ˜I had to carefully carry the hot mug over to the milk/sugar station across the room (it is a small room, so that's good), and then hunt for a clean spoon since there were none available at the station. ˜If you're serving sit-down brunch, your patrons should be able to remain sitting while prepping their coffee. The food was also really good, but also not consistently awesome across the board. ˜My boyfriend had the smoked salmon with poached eggs and hollandaise on their homemade English muffins. ˜It was amazing 0 the hollandaise was just the right amount of lemony and thin to feel refreshing, not gloopy and fatty. ˜His English muffin was also tender and delicious. My dish, on the other hand, had a very hard English muffin, on which some slices of a less-than-good avocado were perched atop sprouts and then topped with poached eggs and a side of roasted tomatoes. ˜The tomatoes were bomb and the eggs and sprouts were fine, but the avocado sucked. ˜They even had the black strings in them - that's just not a good avocado. This whole dish would have been 10 times more delicious with pesto, so hopefully they read this and add it :) It seems like some of the staff were new and there's definitely potential to improve the little inconsistencies at Toast. ˜I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Philly."
5097,0,4,1,11/2/2013,"Toast has a really nice and relaxed ambiance. ˜I stopped in on the go with a friend and was impressed. They had a nice variety of teas and coffee. ˜I tried their chai tea latte, and it was delicious. ˜My friend tried one of their more exciting tea blends, and she loved it. ˜We also had bagels, which were a little pricey, but great for our on-the-go breakfast. ˜I'd love to come back for a more sit-down experience because I loved their space with lots of windows, comfortable-looking seats with pillows, and the open space."
5098,0,3,1,10/28/2013,"I found myself walking by Toast while I was in the area to do a photo shoot. ˜It was a cold day and a corner coffee joint was just what I needed. ˜I liked the vibe as soon as I walked in. ˜It has a good look, it was bustling with people drinking coffee and eating. ˜The staff was friendly and the menu offered what I was looking for. ˜ While I waited for my coffee to be made, I grabbed a seat on the little sofa. ˜A great spot to relax, people watch and consume caffeine. ˜The prices were totally fair, nothing crazy. ˜My drink was good and served up with that added touch of Barista art. ˜I'd visit here again if I find myself in the area again."
5099,0,4,1,10/25/2013,"Not a big breakfast person but this place has changed my mind. Wasn't pleased with their coffee but had the poached eggs and smoked salmon and have decided breakfast is my new favorite meal after dessert. Hollandaise sauce? Perfection. Greens and fruits? Fresh and succulent. I never give my son juice because of added sugar, but at Toast, fresh squeeze ripe orange juice it is. ˜The only reason this didn't get 5 from me was because the latte tasted watered down and the service was a bit snotty. But barring that, Toast it is for any brunch occasion... I wonder if they do take out..."
5100,0,5,1,10/20/2013,"I absolutely love Toast. ˜I live by a ton of coffee shops/brunch places and Toast is my favorite. ˜Very friendly staff, best cup of coffee in the area, and incredible bacon, egg, and cheese croissants. ˜A little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for."
5101,0,4,1,10/2/2013,"I am sooo pleased to have Toast in my neighborhood. ˜After this space went from empty to restaurant to coffeeshop/restaurant to coffeeshop, it is time that a solid cafe took root. ˜The decor is simple and airy, given the large glass windows facing 12th and Spruce Streets. ˜I love sitting in on the cushioned window seats lounging on the pillows as I pretend to work and really people watch. ˜The space is ideal for study, brunch with friends or grab-and-go coffee. The coffee itself is quite tasty and they offer multiple varieties. ˜They have seasonal drinks and now offer juices and smoothies. ˜Yum! ˜Have a coffee and a juice and breakfast is complete. ˜But if you want something more substantial, choose from their croissants, bagels, brownies or salads and sandwiches. ˜I personally like the hummus wrap which is full of nutrients and fresh flavors. ˜Good for morning or evening work sessions. Lastly, I have to comment that the owners and staff are so friendly and accommodating. ˜I always have pleasant chats with the baristas, and on my most recent visit noticed the cup holding everyone's loyalty cards (so you don't have to remember to bring it with you)! ˜Best neighborhood coffee spot!"
5102,0,4,1,9/28/2013,"This place has a different taste on breakfast and brunch, and I'm a fan. You won't find some of the basics: eggs your way, pancakes... you know what I mean. BUT! you will find a fresh perspective with a fresh ambience, fresh service, fresh food, and a fresh view of the street corner from any seat in the house. The quirky highlight - the toast theme. Toast takes eggs benedict to different level. It's not that dish smothered in hollandaise. Instead, there are seven varieties called ""egg toasts,"" all $10.50 or less. Still poached eggs sitting on top of english muffin (they're fresh baked on premise), but the toppings vary. We ordered the ""warm apples"" egg toast that came with baked apple, sausage, and white cheddar. Delicious, appropriate and ""responsible"" portion (read: not so big that you'll feel like junk after), and served with a side salad. Perfect size for E-money. I had the egg sandwich. Starts at $2.50 and then you pay extra for things like tomato, avocado, cheese, bacon/sausage, etc. Bacon ($1.75), avocado ($2), and smoked gouda ($1) were my choices with their delicious english muffin (couldn't tell you which cheeses are available - smoked gouda was the first i heard and i stopped our server there). Other ""toast"" choices include white, wheat, baguette, bagel, croissant. The sandwich didn't disappoint. Cheese wasn't melted, which let the taste of the smoked gouda really come through. Egg is fried. Add some ketchup and Tapatio hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Our side of turkey sausage was a-ok, but nothing to get excited about. Curious as to whether they make the sausage or bring it in. Coffee drinkers can expect a good cup of joe - E-money is super picky about coffee but she gave Toast's warm cup a ringing endorsement. If you prefer tea, like me, then you'll be pleased with the variety. I had ginger mint! Really enjoyed our breakfast at Toast. Showed up a little after 10am ˜on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait, a tough thing to come by these days with the brunch craze. I bought their dark chocolate, sea salt brownie when I paid for the bill up at the counter - looks awesome. Expect to see me back at Toast in a hurry - you should probably follow suit."
5103,0,4,1,9/11/2013,"Super convenient considering I live on top of the coffee shop! I love the coffee and free mimosa during the weekends for brunch. You heard me free mimosa!!! It doesn't get better than having a hearty but healthy breakfast with a mimosa. This place is still new so I would assume the brunch menu will continually evolve and become much more expansive over time. Right now you won't get the traditional brunch stuff like eggs and bacon or omelates but they do have a very interesting menu! Did I mention the free mimosa? I also like the vibe when this place goes back to its coffee shop roots, if I was a student I would most definitely hang out at toast and study and consume coffee!"
5104,0,3,1,7/23/2013,"Very cute coffee shop. Quick and nice service. A group of us were about to head out for some afternoon fun. Since Mother Nature is angry and is giving us heat waves, we ordered iced drinks. All were tasty and did the caffeine trick."
5105,0,4,1,7/22/2013,"Super-cute, very comfy, and everyone there has been nothing but friendly and helpful. ˜ The reason for the missing star is that things are a bit on the expensive side here. I probably wouldn't stop in for a coffee to go... but then if you're planning on camping out to use the wifi or read, it makes more sense to invest in a nice comfortable setting."
5106,0,4,1,7/7/2013,"Great decor and vibe. Secured wifi. Excellent freshly-queezed OJ. Fantastic eggs Benedict with lox and asparagus. Service could be friendlier. But overall it's still an excellent option for brunch or lunch. Too bad their air ventilation is poor: every time we went (i.e. dozens) after 45 minutes in the caf?, our eyes would start itching. And after 60 mins we would have to leave, at which point we would both be smelling like we cooked in their kitchen for a couple of hours. So for this only reason, we've stopped going. Too bad."
5107,0,4,1,6/20/2013,Excellent coffee and nice sandwiches. Really good for a quick breakfast and relaxing cup of coffee.The bagels are really decent and I'm a New Yorker!
5108,0,1,1,6/13/2013,"Great idea, great menu, awful food. My sandwich had undercooked eggs...and a hair on it :("
5109,0,5,1,6/7/2013,"I won't rate the coffee itself since my company roasts some but they brew it right, they really know how to pull a great shot of espresso! The food is exemplary, and the service is always with a smile. Great shop, i always stop in when I am in the neighborhood."
5110,0,4,1,6/2/2013,"YOLO, I'm kind of glad you only live once, and I hope your successor does not also follow it's namesake, because Toast, I like you, and I don't want you to be toast. PROS For a studying spot this gets 5 stars: it's quiet, (aside from some pleasant background music), there are usually study spots near outlets, an abundance of pillows for comfort, reliable wifi, high ceilings, good people watching when you zone out, and last but not least... there is never anyone here (although this doesn't bode well for the future of the place, I selfishly love the emptiness). They take credit cards and I found their food reasonably priced (although I can't vouch for the quality). They actually have an extensive menu with salads and eggs benedict (around $10) as well as cheaper toast/bagel options. The one barrista is super sweet, the first time I came in when she was working, she was so friendly I had to stop and figure out if I knew her and she was actually a best friend I'd forgotten I had, or just super awesome. It was the latter. She also took pity on us and brought us water after we'd been miserably staring at our screens/books for a few hours. CONS Drinks are a bit overpriced (2.75 for a tea?) and they don't have a huge selection of teas. The AC was spotty last week, but they've resolved the issue I think. Highly recommend as a study spot, or a place for weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining. So let's raise a toast to Toast, and hope this one sticks."
5111,0,5,1,6/1/2013,"Stumbled upon this great cafe when looking for brunch one day. Great ""egg toasts"" - their version of eggs benedict, in a variety of ways. Excellent coffee and espresso beverages, and everyone is really friendly!"
5112,0,2,1,5/28/2013,"Went around noon on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend, 2013. ˜Sat outside. Ordered something that amounted to eggs benedict with mushrooms, with a side of turkey sausage, and french pressed coffee. ˜ Service was good - ˜attentive and friendly. ˜ Coffee came out first. ˜Under brewed. ˜Brown in color. ˜Poached eggs were undercooked, barely. ˜Eggs were atop what seemed like an english muffin, which was not toasted, and chewy :-P ˜ Turkey sausage, in silver dollar form, tasted funny. ˜Everything was tepid, except for the iced water. I didn't mention anything to service. ˜I don't think they asked. It's a nice space, and their coffee options are great. ˜I hope they get better at execution of food and drink."
5113,0,3,1,5/24/2013,"Decor is nice, and food and coffee are both decent. It's just not good enough to justify the prices, though."
5114,0,4,1,5/7/2013,"This place is new, and quaint. The coffee is superb, and well-made. Each cup is make from it's own grind and french press. Don't go here full, the food is equally good.. I got the poached eggs on toast (YUM). This location is near everything, and a short walk to Midtown Village or the Gayborhood for shopping after. Very cool vibe here, quick, friendly service. This place deserves your attention."
5115,0,3,1,5/2/2013,"I am absolutely enthusiastic about a cute coffee shop finally opening up in this space! The space is decent, its not too loud of overrun like other coffee shops in the area, and the staff is extremely nice and helpful! I am only giving it three stars, however, because it definitely has room for improvement. I understand that they just opened and are still working through their identity, but I think they could do a little more than just meals or coffee. I am a huge tea drinker and am unimpressed with their tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea is usually my favorite, and all of theirs fall short. They could use a few fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. I also they should expand on their ""snack"" section too. I am not sure if this is something they want to do, however, if they want to be a weekday coffee shop, offering some little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go a long way for the student who doesn't want a full meal, but just a little something to hold them over. All that being said, their breakfasts are absolutely amazing and their coffee and espresso selections great. What they do, they do well, they could just benefit from a little growth."
5116,0,4,1,4/20/2013,"Finally a cafe in this spot that I like. Ever since Oddfellows closed down, I haven't set foot in the place. (For some reason I couldn't bring myself to frequent a restaurant called YOLO) I haven't tried the food yet, as I was just there to have coffee and study, but the ambience was friendly, the iced coffee tasty, and the server's British accent quite charming. See you soon, Toast!"
5117,0,5,1,4/9/2013,"It's not common for me to give out a 5-star review but Toast has earned it. ˜ They earn an easy 3 stars from the food and coffee. ˜It tastes great, eggs and bacon done perfectly to order. ˜I feel like the prices are low enough that I don't feel guilty stopping in a few times a week. The fourth star is earned by having an unfussy but cute cafe seating area and free wifi. ˜They don't mind me hanging out for a few hours on a weekday to get some work done while enjoying coffee and an egg sandwich. ˜Way better food and ambiance than chain coffee shops - this is a great place for a casual morning business meeting. We've been to visit for Sunday brunch too. ˜They have a few extra people on and there's never been a wait. The fifth star is due to their wonderful customer service. ˜The two girls that I see there almost all the time are welcoming and friendly. ˜After my first few visits, they recognize me and know what I'm going to order. ˜ I will definitely keep coming back to Toast, and I hope it fares better than YOLO and Odd Fellows."
5118,0,5,1,4/8/2013,Toast is such a cute place with a very cute name! I'm so happy this coffee shop on my block reopened...and they reopened for the better (formerly known as YOLO formerly known as Odd Fellows)! Everyone who works at Toast is so friendly and I love its bright atmosphere. Their coffee is strong and amazing. I'm a big fan of their Americanos and lattes.
5119,0,4,1,4/7/2013,"I really like this place a lot! Came for brunch with some friends from out of town. Green Eggs was packed and Valanni wasnt open yet...little did we know what a great time we would have at Toast! The staff was great and efficient. Even when we werent sure that we would be staying to eat, they happily sat us for just drink orders. We ended up deciding to stay and were all happy with our lattes and meals. I got poached eggs with vegetarian chili and avocado---yummmm. I loved the fresh side salad it came with. The only downer would be a $3 substitute charge for a ""large"" portion of side potatoes for my friend who didnt want a side salad. But other than that, it was a great experience. Nice ambiance and great people watching. Even though it is a smaller place, they didnt try to rush us out of our table. Much appreciated!"
5120,0,2,1,4/7/2013,Paid $7 for a bagel with lox to go. I got one tiny sliver of lox. And it took 15 minutes. What a complete joke.
5121,0,3,1,4/1/2013,"The cafe itself is pretty cute. It has a mix of chairs and comfy booth seats with some fancy pillows to dress it up. The staff were also friendly. When we were looking at the menu from outside, the prices for coffee seemed a little high, but my boyfriend and I decided to check it out anyway. We ordered drip coffee and it cost less than we expected, so I think we must have been looking at the price of french pressed coffee or one of the fancy variations....The coffee itself was a bit weak, but maybe it's just because I'm a fan of dark roasts, and this was a light one. I'm definitely willing to give it a second chance and maybe try some food next time because I saw other guests chowing down on some tasty-looking breakfast."
5122,0,3,1,3/30/2013,"Was quite excited about this new place, but have to say was rather disappointed. ˜The service was lacklustre, like everything was a bit too much trouble. ˜And sadly the food, while beautifully presented, didn't live up to its promise. ˜The place is selling itself on ""toast"", so really it should be serving perfectly toasted English muffins. ˜Ours weren't soft enough in the middle and were under toasted. ˜Coffee was fine but nothing to write home about. Overall, there was nothing offensive about the place. ˜It was just underwhelming enough to not bother going back, in a city packed with great brunch places."
5123,0,4,1,3/27/2013,FInally a place where I can relax and enjoy the atmosphere without it costing a fortune. It is very clean and cozy. Staff is personable. Great place for a lazy day or informal date.
5124,0,1,1,3/21/2013,"I'm relatively new to PHL, however this place has changed name +/- management about 3-4 times so far. One would imagine that such abysmal business would learn as it attempts to reinvent itself. This new edition, or Toast, is clearly not doing well again, judging from its persistent lack of clientele. The other day I walked in, and hardly anything was done to the decor. It remains bland and unoriginal, despite the prime geo location. A mere Earl Grey cost more than any other CC caf? by an astonishing dollar! My surprise meant that I discussed the issue with my partner and we both wondered what the management of this place are thinking. Today, I decided to go into this place again, to give it another assessment. Like before, a mere couple of customers and a bored looking barista. The toll, $2.95 for a 16 oz coffee! Extortionate and the worst transaction of my AMEX in a long time. When you consider that a good coffee somewhere else in the Center City is around $1.75 you realise how absurd Toast is. Justification? Coffee beans grown in extraterrestrial soil fertilised by the manure produced by the last unicorn? Won't be returning here."
5125,0,5,1,3/14/2013,"I love this cafe. It's a fantastic place to study. There's wi-fi and outlets. Decent coffee and tea. I enjoy their chai, which is very creamy and slightly sweet. Great and comfortable environment. I love eggs benedict, so I can't wait to try their food one day. I love love LOVE this place!"
5126,0,4,1,3/9/2013,"I have been here three times for breakfast & love it. ˜The poached eggs with sausage, cheddar cheese & dijonnaise is great! ˜Only downside is it gets hot in there when it is sunny & they do not have shades to keep the sun out of your eyes."
5127,0,3,1,3/1/2013,"This place just opened down the street from me, so I was excited to finally have something in the otherwise vacant storefront as of a month ago. Toast is a nice place to stop in for a speciality coffee, latte, or espresso and they really know what they're doing there. However, when it comes to ordering their food such as breakfast sandwiches or egg toasts, they're pretty slow. So be prepared to wait. However, if you're having a lazy Saturday or Sunday with time to kill, have a seat in one of their pillowed booths and enjoy."
5128,0,4,1,2/26/2013,"First it was Odd Fellows and the only memorable quality was its name. Then it was YOLO (You Only Live Once) and it was just as bad and tasteless as its name. Now it's simply Toast. This time someone got it just right. That someone is V., who owns Chhaya on East Passyunk ˜avenue. V brings the same high qualityingredients and superb cooking ˜to Center City. With a distinctly uncomplicated flare you can choose from sandwiches, salads, pastries and a list of sides. You can mix and match or just stick with a classic ""bacon , egg and cheese"" and, voila, you're done. There's a fussiness to Center City dining that gets on my nerves. I hate it when a server can't pronounce menu items or when a foreign word or phrase is used when English would suffice. Toast chucks the fussiness for breakfast and lunch fare. This streamlined method is all I want when I am still slightly drunk from the night before and my stomach is on ""carb-cheese-MEAT"" mode. Great for ˜morning and midday meals, toast is a win for Center City."
5129,0,5,1,2/21/2013,"Replacing YOLO Cafe, Toast has an eclectic blend of loose leaf teas & coffee, delicious ""egg toasts"" (poached eggs on top of homemade english muffins), sandwiches and other homemade goodies. *Try the egg toast with warm apples, white cheddar cheese, sausage and dijonnaise! AMAZING. I'm so impressed by their revamping of this place, the interior is cozy, clean and perfect for brunch with friends or studying on a Thursday afternoon. The baristas are helpful, friendly and warm. I will be coming here on a weekly basis. Cheers to Toast!"
5130,0,4,1,2/13/2013,"Great atmosphere, very clean and awesome coffee! We needed a place like this for our neighborhood! :)"
5131,0,2,1,2/12/2013,"There is good news and bad news. The good news, they do make a good cup of coffee. Now the bad. I was looking for a place to stop by and have a cup of coffee. First, I passed right by the place. It looked like a regular restaurant to me, but it isn't, it's a coffee shop. I was confused by a coffee shop called ""toast"". ˜As to they really don't sell anything toasted. It looks like a typo, I think they meant to call it ""roast"". As that would have made sense. The places looks great, if they were selling Caribbean food. It looks very light and tropical looking ˜with floor to ceiling windows. The menu was confusing. You need to be a wine expert to understand that the ""hint"" of a favor is a note. Meaning, not favored coffee. They had drawings of a french press and another one that I couldn't really know what it was. I guess you have to ask? On the counter they had laminated papers moving around all over the place with the real menu. All in all it's a very confusing place."
5132,1,1,0,4/17/2014,"well if that picture of mimi m.""pigging out "" above isn't enough to ruin your appetite the food will ˜. it tastes like R&L ˜frozen crap , when you change things be aware that a lot of people will notice ...the pizza is ok but used to be better , ˜. the pizza is about the only thing edible. ˜ ˜mimi please no more pics while your eating ˜!"
5133,1,1,0,7/23/2013,racist rock bar typical bayonne bar
5134,1,1,0,4/13/2013,This place is truly terrible ....as a boy growing up I enjoyed there food specially there buffalo wings now the food is just nasty.....maybe they hired a different cook or something but they need to invest in a new cook or something .....food was nowhere near as good as it use to be.
5135,1,1,0,3/18/2010,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! I tried taking my teenage daughter there last summer to celebrate her winning a cheerleading competetion. We were immediatly seated & told our server would be right with us.We waited almost 10min. & a (I assume) manager asked if we were ok. I told her we were dying of thirst! She asked us what we would like then walked to a server & told her what to get us. The server than walked towards us & was distracted by her friends at the bar. We waited another 5 min. before I was too frustrated (&hungry) to wait anymore. We got up & started to walk out when that same manager (I assume) rushed over to tell us our drinks would be right out. I told her no thank you & we will never be returning!
5136,1,2,0,5/20/2014,pizza is alright but the other food is pretty tough .
5137,1,4,0,9/22/2013,"Try the thin pizza, best around!"
5138,1,4,0,8/24/2013,"I love their thin pizza and thier grilled chicken salad - not to mention their french onion soup. ˜A really fun place, fresh food, and great entertainment."
5139,1,4,0,12/12/2012,"Just moved into area from Florida what a great find. Sports lounge, pool table, free WiFi, great bartender( Stacy ) just a short walk away from home Great!!!"
5140,1,4,0,5/11/2011,"This place is one of my favorite bars in New Jersey to go and have a drink. They always have a good beer selection and the bartenders are cool with you if they have seen you a few times and will take care of you. It's a great place to watch sporting events of any type, and it's got a really nice outdoor tiki lounge to chill out in the summer. The clientele is definitely colorful but that's what makes it fun. And unlike most other chill bars that I've been to, the food is really great, especially the pizza and the wings. Big thumbs up! I've spent many a fun night here."
5141,1,5,0,10/4/2010,"The bar side is great tvs everywhere, outsides a nice feature, food is amazing Specially after 3 drinks, this is the bar to be at in bayonne. Convenient, a nice pool table for a good time with your friends. Also the servers are on par, and if u go ask for chris. He""s an upcoming comedian. ˜Also ask for kim she's hotttt. And of course your drink is never empty, what more would u want from a sports bar. I'd give them 10 stars."
5142,1,5,0,9/25/2010,"Probably the best pizza you will find in town. ˜If you are going to the Big Apple, you have to try their famous thin crust Pizza, its the best around. ˜Toni and Vin run a great Sports Bar and the restaurant next to it is equally well run. ˜The service is always fast and the food is always served hot. ˜I have been there with my family several times and we always enjoy the big apple."
5143,1,4,1,5/11/2014,"I have only had takeout here. They make a great thin crisp pizza. It rivals Star Tavern in Orange. Toppings are abundant ,great eggplant"
5144,1,1,1,4/16/2014,Ordered pick up 2x this week. Both times food was burnt. Called only the second time to complain offered to give me more shitty food told them no thanks I don't even want to eat. Was asked if I wanted my $ back so I said sure. 3 ppl later a nasty woman aid in order to get my $ I needed to bring my good back. I already wasted my time and appetite and I have to go back to them? No thanks save your time and patience.
5145,1,1,1,2/21/2014,U have to be drunk to eat the food here They should be ashamed to serve this I came her with my pregnant wife and she stopped eating in fear of the safety of our un born child They give u paper plates to eat off of .....
5146,1,5,1,2/15/2014,Delicious Wings! Delicious Thin Pizza! Love this spot to pig out!
5147,1,2,1,12/28/2013,"This is more of a 2 1/2 star review. The sad thing is, I go here pretty frequently because I can walk here. If you want to drink Yuenglings or Bud light and watch baseball, hockey and football, go here. They have a lot of TVs and a projection screen where you can usually catch the Yankees or Devils. I don't care about football, but I assume you can watch the Giants here. I don't think people actually like the Jets. If you want to go to a bar and hang out and act like a civilized human being, eat something of sustenance, and not hang out with the Old Man Budweiser Crowd and Bayonne Police Department go somewhere else. Lot 13 is cool. Venice is cool. The food is not edible, except for the pizza. But Bayonne is land of pizza and there are other, better options. I don't love this bar. But it is the closest place to my apartment."
5148,1,1,1,5/25/2013,"I went there to grab something to eat. Mind you, I am not reviewing the bar area since I did not hang out there. I am only reviewing the dinning side. You walk in, and all you see is green everywhere: chairs, rug (that looks quite dirty) and wallpaper. With that being said, the ambience it is pretty horrible. I noticed that everyone walking in could qualify for medicare -- so if you are within that age group, maybe you will like this place. if you are in your 20-30s, just go somewhere else. We sit down and at this point, I am praying the food to be good. We ordered the wings which were ok, nothing special. My husband ordered a pizza which was good (I would actually consider ordering it for delivery). I got an antipasto salad. It was ok. Also the menu is extensive, pretty regular american cuisine menu. Seems like most people go there for the thin crust pizza. The service was not good, the waitress forgot about my salad, she tried to play it off but it was quite obvious. Never got a refill for my drink. Needless to say it was not a good experience overall. Maybe if they put a few dollars into fixing this place it would be worth something. As it currently stands I would stay away from it."
5149,1,3,1,12/24/2012,"This place used to be one of my favorite sports bars, to some extent it still is. I used to come here all the time, it is a great place to sit and watch sports , got good projectors , giants screens for the big games and good tenders. The bar par is absolutely amazing, although recently it seems like they are doing something different and it just isnt as good. But even with not being as good as it normally is , its still a great bar pie. ˜Thin crusted and well done for a bit of crispness. Yumm! That quality of your night here is kinda of hit or miss depending on the crowd. ˜Its seems like over the last few years there have been a lot more of your older sit in a corner and get nearly pass out drunk types. The types that either get alittle to chatty and friendly or try to hit on anything that movies by yelling at it. (Think what a typical shore guido would be 40 years from now) But if you get a good crowd its still a great time when people arent getting to belligerent . It gets pretty crowded for the football games so come early to grab a good spot. It makes for a nice Sunday , but if ˜its not a Thursday/Friday night or some sports event is going on the crowd gets weird. ˜Come on a weekend or a Friday night and your all set for a good time any other night is hit or miss. PS huge parking lot around back for easy parking."
5150,1,2,1,6/26/2012,Pizza use to be pretty good but the quality has gone to hell. ˜If you do decide to order from here and have it delivered make sure you do it in advance as it seems to always take them over an hour to get you your food even if it's being delivered only 15 block away. So expect your food to be stone cold....and I mean cold. ˜Think of eating food that was sitting on the table for 3 hours then eat it. ˜Very disappointing considering the food (albeit bar food) didn't ˜always lack this much in quality from there.
5151,1,4,1,7/21/2011,"This place has the best thin crust pizza, period. People rave about Pete and Elda's at the shore, and there are other places around the state with some decent thin crust pizza, but THIS is the real deal. As I understand it, it's the exact same pizza recipe that was used at EJ's in Bayonne back in the day. I went to EJ's A LOT as a kid growing up in Jersey City, and can confirm that it really is the exact same stuff. Perfectly cooked thin crust, lots of cheese and tasty sauce. It's thin crust pizza done right! Don't come here for fancy decor, prompt and professional service, or any bells and whistles. Go here for PIZZA. This is Bayonne, and this place represents Bayonne pretty accurately, in my eyes. It's the best representation of Bayonne thin crust pizza. Go to the place down the street if you don't want the super thin crust."
5152,1,1,1,6/24/2011,worst ˜pizza I ever had!
5153,1,4,1,2/22/2011,"It's a good place to watch a game, have a few beers, and apps. There is a decent menu. I'm a fan of the buffalo blasts and the Steak Murphy wrap. During the warmer months, there's a tiki bar."
5154,1,4,1,10/15/2010,"I love the big apple bar. ˜It is thier thin crusted pizza that keeps me coming back, its the best! ˜if u have a big appetite order two pies bc the crust is so thin u can see through it...LOL......i have never eaten a main course thiere but thier appetizers are awesome as well the fried raviolis and the fried mac and cheese bites.....delicious..... basically this place is good for appetizers a couple beers and of course pizza"
5155,1,1,1,5/4/2010,Zero stars. This place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Terrible food and the clientele is straight out of The Hills Have Eyes.
5156,1,1,1,5/28/2007,"I like to support local businesses so when I kept seeing commercials for Big Apple, I thought it would be a good place to go and eat. This place is divided into two areas. The bar, which looks nice and very sporty, and the dining area, where my wife and I sat. This area looks like an old folks home. I have to say, this was the worst ""restaurant"" food I ever had in my life. It was as if they ran to to local grocery store, bought some frozen food, microwaved it and gave it to me. It was terrible! The salad was chunks of lettuce root and not very appealing. I will NEVER go back to this place and will tell anyone who asks about this place to avoid it like the plague. Is it possible to give a place negative stars?"
5157,2,2,0,5/27/2014,"VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I are regulars to the State Street location and usually very satisfied. ˜They are fast, reasonably priced and good. ˜But tonight we had one of the worst experiences ever. We ordered our usual, which is vegetable chimichangas with everything (meaning rice, black beans, guac and pico de gallo) hot sauce and sour cream and beef chimichangas with everything except no sour cream or hot sauce. Where it went wrong... my boyfriend eats no poultry, beef or pork..I eat almost anything except I HATE sour cream and like spice but not hot sauce. ˜We got 2 containers, one marked with a ""B"" and the other unmarked. The one marked with a ""B"" ˜was the vegetable and the unmarked was beef with no hot sauce or sour cream. Unfortunately, ˜for us the unmarked one had beef with hot sauce and sour cream and my boyfriend didn't realize until a few bites in that it had meat. He hasn't put red meat in his body in 25 yrs, so of course this made him sick. Upset, since now neither of us have dinner I called to rectify the problem. ˜The person who answered spoke very little english, so trying to explain the problem was an issue. I asked if there was anyone who spoke english and he put me on with someone. ˜This gentleman told me thats how I ordered it and kept responding with ""yeah?"" ...So, after a very frustrating few minutes and no offer to comp our meal, remake it right or offer us a comp on our next visit, I told him he just lost a once a week customer. WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!! They would've recieved a four star reveiw otherwise."
5158,2,3,0,8/7/2012,"We went to La Carreta for lunch but it was closed. So we went there again for dinner, and fortunately, after a long trudge, we finally sat around a table. The restaurant is located in a residential area, quiet and peaceful, with an obscure deep green signboard. It was not convenient to get there, and there were few customers in (to be more exact, zero before we entered). The environment had nothing special, in comparison with other Mexican restaurants. There were small decorations like a picture of a Mexican man. Not much use of bright colors, and the whole room and the furniture looked a little bit old. There were only four tables in it. I guess they possibly provide more delivery service. The kitchen is the main part of the restaurant, and they didn't seem very used to providing table service. We had to ask for silverware, and they only had paper napkins. There were three or four people working in the restaurant, most of time they were cooking food, except that one of them would run out if the customer had any need. We could see pictures of dishes on the wall, and they were extremely useful to foreigners like me and my roommates. The menu was a piece of paper, convenient and easy to understand. I took one, hoping to learn the complex names of Mexican dishes. Haha... It took about 15 minutes until all our dishes were served. Not fast, in my opinion. We had 5 people and we ordered: Chicken Burritos, Beef Burritos. Chicken Quesadillas, Enchiladas and Vegetarian Tacos. Burritos were in an American style, as one of my friends commented, but they tasted good. I found beans, cheese, cabbage and chicken in the fillings, and I liked them all. Quesadillas was soft, and had a strong taste of cheese. Another friend felt that the cheese was not Mexican - the orange color signaled it was likely cheddar cheese. Enchiladas were too sweet and not spicy enough. Vegetarian Tacos was full of vegetables and looked healthy. The flour tortillas served with the tacos did not taste extremely fresh. Maybe they were purchased and stored rather than made in the restaurant. We also ordered Mexico-made sodas. Different flavors, different colors, the right sweetness, made with real sugar, a nice change from normal soda menus. The price was relatively low, and the portion was big. We spent about $9 per person, including tips. I only managed to finish half of my burritos. In conclusion, though the meal was authentic as we expected, they tasted not bad and at least worth the money we paid. The environment and service were barely satisfactory."
5159,2,4,0,4/26/2014,For the price this place is solid. Cart food out of a restaurant. Cash only.
5160,2,5,0,10/23/2011,"best burritos in connecticut, love the cart by the yale hockey rink"
5161,2,5,0,9/22/2010,"This review is for the La Carreta cart up Prospect Street on Science Hill. I have passed the food carts there for years and have been wary of trying them. For my first one, I chose La Carreta because I was in the mood for a burrito, and the chicken burrito was to die for. He warms up the huge tortilla and piles on the ingredients, from tomatoes, cheese, a coleslaw/cabbage-kind of salad that is delicious, black beans, rice, chicken, sour cream, and such. The burrito was fresh and by far surpasses the quality of Moe's, the local chain Mexican eatery. The huge burrito was only $4.50 and well worth the money."
5162,2,5,0,8/2/2010,"this place is flippin amaaaaazing. the pork is the best- tender and juicy and abundant! the menu is simple and cheap, always prepared to perfection. so glad they are close, bc my la caretta addiction is strooooonnnnng! nom!"
5163,2,4,1,11/20/2014,"This is a review for the cart by the Med School. I love a good taco. Burrito...quesadilla....etcetera. This cart has, by far, the best tacos I've had in New Haven! For 6 dollars you get rice, beans, and three tacos (with toppings/fillings of your choice), sour cream and smoky chipoltle sauce. I crave these on the regular. Stop by the cart when you're in the area - you won't be disappointed."
5164,2,5,1,11/17/2014,Best tacos in New Haven.
5165,2,5,1,7/28/2014,Consistently good and fresh and actually pretty amazing considering the price. The veggie quesadillas are awesome--really anything with their sauteed mushrooms. ˜The ˜people working there are cool and very patient when you try out your pathetic Spanish when ordering and picking up. Their cart on the corner of Elm and Bway is great for lunch--fast and reliable.
5166,2,4,1,7/14/2014,"This review is specifically for their cart on Cedar St. outside of YNHH, which has been a standby of mine for the better part of a decade. Great veggie burritos, great chicken soft tacos, and if you ask politely, the lovely woman who prepares the food will make essentially any additions or substitutions you could possibly want. Even if you catch her later in the afternoon the food is still fresh and as good as always."
5167,2,5,1,7/11/2014,They have a food truck which serves super mexican food. They've ˜got seriously great food here. To make it even better their prices are on point!
5168,2,2,1,4/10/2014,"This is perhaps the worst Mexican food in all of New Haven. The meat is usually chewy and the prices are kinda high. Maybe I shouldn't compare them to the food trucks at Long Wharf but c'mon, 3 tacos for $7 is sort of pricey. That's $2.33 a taco. Sure they provide some rice and beans but it's a tiny portion and it's not very good. Plus, the simplest order usually takes a ridiculously long time to prepare. Taquerias like this place are suppose to be quick and painless. But every time I get take-out it seems like I caught them completely by surprise and they have to scramble 2,000 miles to Mexico to cook my food."
5169,2,2,1,1/22/2014,"I really don't understand the hype of the food at the State Street location... It's cool that they have cabbage in their burritos, but that's about it. I tried to ask for some chips/guacamole/ chips and they charged me 3$ for a handful of those thick crunchy round chips with a blob of ""guacamole"" that definitely had a bunch of sour cream filler in it- was not fresh at all. They didn't have any salsa @ all. The food wasn't horrible, but it didn't wow and the ingredients seemed pretty cheap. Maybe I'll try the cart since that seems what folks are raving about, but I don't think I'll need to head back to their State Street location."
5170,2,4,1,8/17/2013,"cabbage! no wilted, soggy lettuce here, just crunchy cabbage. cheap, huge and delicious. i only get the vegan stuffs but at night i see them cutting hunks of meat down for the next morn. all very fresh and everyone is always super nice."
5171,2,4,1,5/1/2013,"This place is the best Mexican in New Haven. The veggie tacos are flavorful and kinda healthy. Great rice and beans. And no it's not the place for romantic first date, but I like watching the Mexican soap opera on tv while waiting for my food."
5172,2,5,1,4/16/2013,"For cheap mexican, there's nothing better. ˜Enchiladas mole is fantastic. ˜Great service, poor atmosphere but well worth it! More selection than their carts."
5173,2,3,1,3/21/2013,"This review is for the food cart on York street near Yale. ˜For $5, you can get one HUGE burrito. ˜It does take away any hunger, as for taste, I've had better, to be honest. ˜Not that the burrito was bad, everything tasted fresh, but the flavor I expect from a Mexican cart was lacking. ˜The Mexican trucks down along Long Wharf seem to be much more authentic, but my only concern about them is the cleanliness."
5174,2,4,1,1/28/2013,"Loved the value of this over-stuffed burrito. ˜It filled me up for an even $6! ˜ The quality was excellentl! ˜Ordered a basic chicken burrito which was loaded with chicken, black beans (not refreid beans :)) whole grain rice (not white rice :)) cabbage, a little cheese and a bunch of other stuff. ˜The tortilla was fresh, chewy and warm. My only complaint is that I like a messy Burrito where all the sour cream and guac and pico comes squirting out with each bite and this item didn't have much of a sauce on it. The only thing that fell out of it was rice and beans. ˜ I am sure I could have asked for a side of the saucey stuff. Next time I will ask him to put extra into the burrito itself, but then he may not be able to fold the darn thing!!! Definitely recommend this place! ˜You won't be disappointed."
5175,2,5,1,5/2/2012,BEST. IN. NEW HAVEN. now i've been around the block. seen a few things. eaten a few burritos. lived in arizona for awhile and still la carreta knocks my socks off. dont believe me? try it. its delicious. its cheap. the only thing you got to lose is 6 bucks. cash only joint. barely speak english. exactly how it should be. PS. mexico coca cola. awwwwww yeahhhhhh
5176,2,4,1,4/22/2012,"Pretty good! Yes, the food here is cheap, but it is also good. My favorite is an order of the chicken tostadas with salsa verde. Another nice thing about this place is that the people who work there are pleasant and friendly. As a space, there is no ambience, so do not think of it as a restaurant where you will want to eat and then hang out with friends for a while. I think it is best for a quick casual meal or take out."
5177,2,5,1,2/11/2012,"Love this place. Prices are very reasonably and food is delicious. Our favorites are the enchiladas. For $6, including rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream, you can't do better. Mostly take-out."
5178,2,1,1,8/10/2011,"I've been using Yelp to scout out places as I just moved to the New Haven ˜area. ˜On most places the reviews are spot on...not here. I got the enchiladas with the mole. ˜They were pretty awful. ˜The mole was ˜totally tasteless, which was better than the taste of the tortillas used. ˜The chicken was acceptably cooked, but the rice and beans just lacked flavor. ˜The place was totally empty when I got my food, and after eating it I can see why. ˜The place just lacked soul (and taste) in the food!"
5179,2,1,1,4/30/2011,"Really? ˜I can't believe that people give them good reviews! ˜Especially those of you that claim to be form Cali! ˜I have lived in CA too. ˜Their burritos aren't nearly as good the ones form the Tijuana taco cart! ˜I live across the street from La Caretta, so I have gotten take out, including their taco salad. ˜I can't imagine something unhealthier and less authentic. ˜The only reviews I understand here are the ones that say the price to amount of food ratio is good. ˜Their burritos ARE cheaper than Tijuana's. ˜The only people I know that eat here are the frugal male scientists that need to maximize their caloric intake to price ratio."
5180,2,5,1,1/22/2011,"I have not been to the restaurant yet, but they set up a cart at the Fair Haven Farmer's Market every Thursday during the summer and early Fall, and I so look forward to getting one of their delicious quesidillas. ˜The amount of very tasty food you get for five dollars is amazing--and they make it while you watch. I swear I am going to get to the restaurant this week; I miss those quesidillas!"
5181,2,5,1,1/3/2011,"This is by FAR the best Mexican food in the New Haven area. $6 gets you anything on the menu and it is delicious. The portions are HUGE and they are more than happy to make custom dishes if you have allergies or food restrictions. The lunch cart on York st is also amazing and you get the same dishes for $5! The veggie tacos are great and you get 3 with sides of rice and beans, and the burritos are huge."
5182,2,5,1,7/17/2010,"Let's kindly remember that I'm from California and therefore am an authority on Mexican food. Now that we've got that fact out of the way . . . I'm writing specifically for their food cart by YNHH, which was always my favorite cart. ˜Love their veggie burritos! ˜I don't know who was the first person to put this sort of shredded cabbage on a burrito, but yes please! The employees are really sweet, and quick, too!"
5183,2,4,1,11/14/2009,"Cabbage is the best addition to a burrito EVER. Sure, they may have studied the Roomba cart guys, but hey...its still awesome! And to add something that most people don't care about but means a lot to me...I forgot they are cash only and they let me owe them $5! Who does that anymore? Its so nice!"
5184,2,5,1,10/20/2009,"In all honesty i've never had a taco salad to compare... the burritos are doled out in large, ˜juicy, delicious portions that hold up well from lunch for a late night snack. i live in VA now and I swear I think about their cart food all the time. there's nothing down here like it... it's better than moe's and better than qdoba!"
5185,2,5,1,4/14/2009,"Best burritos in town! ˜Try, the enchiladas verdes! ˜This place is not a visit for the ambiance. ˜It's more like a taco stand. ˜But it's all about the food. ˜There is no guy playing guitar in your ear or watery salsa. ˜It's just plain old good Mexican food. ˜A rather small menu, but each item packs a punch."
5186,2,5,1,10/14/2008,"Love going in for take-out on State Street - for $6, you get an amazing amount of food and it's delicious. My personal favorite is the beef quesadilla - comes with rice, beans, mango salsa, guac, etc. The staff are all lovely, and their kids are there to entertain while you're waiting for your food. The other day, I discovered they have set up a cart across the street from the Roomba burrito cart. Stopped by for lunch and got the same thing for $5.00. Now that's a lunch bargain and you get so much more than you do at the Roomba cart. Loved it, was great."
5187,2,4,1,9/9/2008,"Best size-to-price ratio in a burrito in New Haven, hands-down without sacrificing quality. Bring tinfoil, 'cause you ain't finishing it."
5188,2,4,1,8/27/2008,"Fast, inexpensive, delicious, and authentic Mexican. ˜Runs circles around the crappy excuse for Mexican at Fresh Taco on Elm St. that may be fast and inexpensive, but is also un-delicious and inauthentic. ˜Fresh sauces and very good rices and beans. ˜Yum."
5189,2,4,1,5/17/2008,"La Carreta is better known for the carts down at the med school and up on Science Hill, but this mom n' pop business has grown and now they've set up shop on State Street. ˜Primarily a takeout place, there are a few tables. ˜My first visit to pick up my food was amusing to me b/c the owners' three sons were frolicking in the ""dining area"" and I had to keep picking them up from the counters and putting them back on solid ground so they didn't run the risk of cracking their skulls open. ˜I really like ""mole"" so I usually get the enchiladas, but I'm sure the other options, burritos, tacos, etc. won't disappoint."
5190,2780,5,1,12/14/2014,"Great sandwiches...this one puts subway and other chains to shame. Everything is super fresh , my personal favorite is their tuna melt. It delicious and melts in the mouth. One thing that is absolutely worth mentioning is the people who run the place. They are extremely friendly and hospitable, this makes you feel welcome and make sure you revisit. Highly recommend tuna melt, Reuben, chicken cutlet sandwich , jersey burger, veggie sub."
5191,2780,5,1,11/11/2014,"The menu is huge, and I've never had a bad sub here. Amazing customer service! Cheesesteaks are one of the best in jersey!"
5192,2780,5,1,10/11/2014,Place was empty so I didn't have high hopes for a good sub. Boy was I wrong!! ˜My son got 1/2 club sub and I got 1/2 meatball parm. The bread was fresh and the meatballs were like home cooking with delicious marinara sauce. The 1/2 subs were too big for either of us to finish. This place is highly recommended.
5193,2780,5,1,8/12/2014,I was hungry and discovered this place near my bank. Very clean and relaxing atmosphere inside and every employee was pleasant. I tried the buffalo chicken sub with jalape?os and it was awesome. Complete with chips and a drink it was $8. I'll be returning!
5194,2780,5,1,8/7/2014,"Great product, great service, courteous staff, clean environment. They obviously care a lot about their business. Oh, and the subs are great :)"
5195,2780,5,1,6/5/2014,"Ive known nick for many years, and now that he owns his own sub shop he did not dissapoint! Besides being very easy on my eyes, he took extreme care of making my very picky order and making it perfect. Brought home subs for my brother and his girlfriend and all 3 of us were beyond pleased with our food. Nick is a great guy, smells unbelivable, and will continue to recieve my business. Thanks hoagie nick!"
5196,4,1,0,10/3/2012,"Disappointed in their Thai food. ˜Ordered their Pad Thai chicken, which is a favorite Thai dish of mine. ˜It was hands down the worst Pad Thai I've ever had. ˜The dish was very bland and had more egg in it than chicken."
5197,4,1,0,1/28/2011,"Worst experience I ever had at a Japanese restaurant!. The waitress was rude and snippy. There were 4 of us- 3 ordered the all-you-can-eat and the 4th ordered another special (same price) that included an appetizer, entree and dessert. When the waitress started to bring over food she told the 4th person, ""Do NOT eat"" Okay I understand the whole concept of ""you can't share"" but come on really??? The person was embarrassed and so was I.The food came out at very odd times. For example, the 4th person got a steak 20 minutes before we got any roles. The waitress forgot to put in our role order and we only got 2 roles. When we asked about it she was very rude!!!! The whole experience was horrible. It wasn't a cheap bill either. They offered to take 15% off but I argued to take an all-you-can-eat price off because one person didn't get any sushi at all! I emailed them to say how upset I am (because I am an regular customer) and I didn't get any reply. ˜DON'T GO!!! Go to Kumo or Sushi X instead."
5198,4,1,0,11/13/2009,"Friday night ""all you can eat"" sushi sounds good right? Not. My wife's dinner never showed up. I was practically done with my sushi before they came out and apologized for the delay. We complained...so they offered a lousy 10% discount -- but only on her meal. Needless to say we got up and left. I had a decent piece of salmon sushi but greasy tempura. Tuna and white tuna was just average. We won't be back."
5199,4,2,0,5/26/2013,"chinese food is good ,but sushi ˜is un fresh."
5200,4,4,0,8/24/2014,"Love the food. Service is a little slow, but very friendly. I love the all you can eat but they often times forget to bring things you order, and if some people order off the menu while others have all you can eat it makes it difficult to eat at the same time."
5201,4,4,0,7/3/2014,"Call in advance for the hot pots. Here is very good for big group/social events or couples. I also order delivery to the New Haven areas on regular basis. The drivers/delivers are usually friendly. I've ordered from Formosa for all kinds of occasions. The only thing I haven't tried is their Sushi... After all, this is more of a Chinese restaurant (which is very good at it) than ""fusion"" or Sushi. Overall, very positive experience for all kinds of occasions--dine in (couples/big groups: hot pots or regular dishes), take out, or delivery for individuals or big caterings--here."
5202,4,4,0,11/17/2012,"Good food and service! I've been back a couple times and usually get the buffet. For a descent price, you can sample a variety of rolls, etc. I'm sure I'll be back!...."
5203,4,4,0,6/10/2012,"This is just one step away from being ""china-town worthy"". ˜Food is fantastic, and despite other reviews, our service was good too. ˜Don't expect fast service from the kitchen to the table though--it's just not that kind of place. ˜Ranks right up there with Lao Szechuan in Milford/Orange. ˜Very good."
5204,4,4,0,11/8/2011,"Amazing sushi, awesome steamed dumplings, green tea and really good service. Will recommend and go back again."
5205,4,4,0,2/4/2011,"Good sushi...real good value. All you eat is 20.00, which is a teriffic price. ˜Loved the Godzilla Roll..."
5206,4,4,0,1/16/2011,"Bought a Groupon for this place a while back and finally went around Christmas to use it. ˜What a good choice! ˜The food was solid, tasty and the service quick. ˜They have an all you can eat sushi (not Groupon-eligible) but 2 in our party had it and said it was second only to Sushi Palace in Hamden...quite a compliment."
5207,4,5,0,9/17/2014,"I tried this place yesterday thought it was different staff was friendly, helpful wish English was a little better so that I could better understand answers to my questions. ˜Food was fresh and menu is pretty good. ˜Service is quick."
5208,4,5,0,1/19/2014,i am admittedly not an asian food expert. ˜but i just love this place. ˜the food is so yummy.
5209,4,5,0,12/13/2013,Best food around. ˜I used to go there every couple of weeks. ˜Never had a bad meal.
5210,4,5,0,2/15/2013,Went there last night. Very impressed! I got the $21.95 all you can eat sushi. Comes quick and the hostess and the waitress are really personable! My new sushi restaurant.
5211,4,5,0,4/26/2012,My father lives in Taiwan so I grew up eating Taiwanese/Chinese food. ˜I find the quality and deliciousness of Formosa's food unsurpassed by any other Chinese restaurant in CT. ˜I often order takeout for easy dinner parties and all of my friends rave about it and make me feel like champion for very little effort.
5212,4,5,0,6/10/2008,"this restaraunt is AMAZING!!! The service is impecable. The entire staff is very friendly and knowledgable of the cuisine. I have yet to have a dish I did not like. Hands down the best asian restaraunt in New Haven county. They have something for everyone, from sushi to pasta to fish to meat. It is all there."
5166,4,3,1,12/30/2014,"Authentic? Not even close. But the all-you-can-eat sushi is a great deal and pretty tasty (as much so as you could reasonably expect for all-you-can-eat anything). The servers are friendly and on top of things, so you're never waiting too long for another round of food or beers. I've never left with a feeling other than the warm contentment, mild shame, and imminent food coma that comes from gorging on so much sushi."
5213,4,5,1,12/13/2014,"Haven't been here since 2011, but this is probably my favorite restaurant ever for providing authentic Sichuan food on (at least at the time) somewhat of a secret menu. My most memorable experience here was taking someone here fairly late at night in the pouring rain, having been on the road for what seemed like an hour or more, and ultimately having everyone agree that the food was totally worthwhile. Before and after that we visited quite often, and sometimes got free stuff like milk tea and ice cream. May have been fried ice cream once. Regardless of whether that was free, it was very, very good. There was this one lovely waitress I really liked. The Dry Saut?ed Sliced Fish Pot was incredible, robust and piquant and full of exotic spices. Sliced Fish with Soft Bean Curd was also excellent and oddly great when refrigerated. I liked the subtle sweetness of it, though the dish was obviously mostly spicy and savory. I keep ordering both of these things ˜in NYC and Boston, but it's never been nearly as good. My parents first had the Spicy Szechuan Sliced Tripe and the Sliced Beef Tendons here in 2008, and as with my experience with the fish dishes, they kept trying to replicate the experience elsewhere, but we ultimately realized our luck with these items had peaked here. It's too bad because I can't see myself ever being in the area again. Also had: Beef Wraps, Tea Smoked Duck, Cumin Lamb, Sauteed Zucchini, Chinese Style Kung Pao Chicken. All good, though not peak level."
5214,4,4,1,12/11/2014,"We've never been to the restaurant, so I can't comment on it. For delivery, these guys are pretty great. ˜Their delivery time is reasonable. ˜The food is a touch on the expensive side for chinese food, but the portions are generous so whatever. ˜The food is pretty good, especially for delivery, although not outstanding. ˜They don't have fortune cookies, which is a bit of a disappointment for my kids (ok, let's be honest, it's a disappointment for me) although they do send those little fried wonton cracker noodle things. ˜ We've ordered from these guys several times now, and they're our go-to for delivery chinese food."
5215,4,5,1,11/22/2014,Awesome restaurant in of all places North Haven CT! We took the All You Can Eat deal and were very impressed. The portions were plenty and the sushi was fresh and well presented. Will definitely go back and wish to try something off the very extensive regular menu.
5216,4,4,1,11/4/2014,"I like this place just because everything is fresh and this is really clean restaurant! A little funny crew works in there that makes me smile every time. Food is really good and sushi chef Mike makes the best rolls around. I wonder why is this place always so slow. Good work guys, keep it up!"
5217,4,5,1,9/15/2014,I've only ever gone to Formosa for the all-you-can-eat special. The sushi is the best around and they have great appetizers. It's a bit pricey so I usually make it a special occasion to go but it's more than worth what you get.
5218,4,3,1,9/8/2014,"I've only had sushi from here, it was okay. Definitely not the best all you can eat in the area, but for being a couple miles away from home it wasn't bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was really craving sushi and didn't feel like going far, this would do. Their seaweed salad is gross, though."
5219,4,4,1,7/23/2014,"Amazing General Chicken, best I've ever had. Dumplings really good"
5220,4,4,1,7/11/2014,"Talking about great Taiwanese home-cooked meals!! ˜I went here with my husband for dinner after work a couple of weeks ago as this was recommended by a family member. The inside of a restaurant was very clean and represented more of a fine dining restaurant than a casual you're-typical-Chinese takeout. ˜The price did reflect that. We ordered from the family-style menu although that section seemed to be mis-categorized as Szichuan style dishes (I was confused and had to check with the waitress). ˜Again, the menu items were pricey but the food was delicious! ˜I thought it was nice of them to translate the menu items into English that sounds more appetizing than your typical Chinese menus and I think (and hoping) this will encourage those who are not familiar with the Taiwanese/Chinese cuisines to try them out. It was our first visit and the food hit the spot! One small complaint was there was only one waitress handling all the tables at the time with the help of the owner/manager (I presume the lady at the reception area was) every now and then so it took a while for things to come through for us, getting the bill etc. I will definitely recommend this place for anyone interesting in trying out authentic Taiwanese cuisine. ˜I will come back but only for special occasions."
5221,4,5,1,4/26/2014,"This place (aside from the sushi, etc.) is Taiwanese (Formosa is Taiwan's nickname), not Chinese. Granted, their cuisines are pretty close but you will find some differences. My wife is Taiwanese and was craving food from her home country so we made the trek from Glastonbury to check this place out. Totally worth it! Owners and majority of the waitstaff are legit Taiwanese and I let my wife order in Mandarin so everything was kind of a surprise and recommended by our waitress Jesse. Beef noodle soup, rainbow fish and tofu casserole, spicy shredded bamboo shoots and saut?ed bean stem. All freaking delicious. HIGHLY recommended. Guaranteed as good and authentic as your going to get in CT."
5222,4,2,1,2/17/2014,"I went to Formosa tonight with my family after hearing great things about the food and the all you can eat deal. ˜When we got there, there was one waiter and one hostess. ˜The waiter was running ragged while the hostess was more like a sloth. ˜It took at least 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and much longer for our food order. ˜After about an hour of just sitting there, our food finally came out. ˜It was decent but nothing extra special. ˜By this time we were so annoyed and tired of sitting there that we just wanted to leave. ˜They left the check off list for us to order our second round of all you can eat sushi but we didn't want to wait another hour for then next round. ˜The waiter was very apologetic and offered us free dessert but we decided against it. ˜It was a huge disappointment and waist of money because we did not eat enough sushi for what we paid. ˜The food may have been better if we were not so aggravated by the time we got it, but all in all they were understaffed, slow kitchen, decent food, and I would not be going there again."
5223,4,3,1,2/10/2014,This place was not what I expected. They are way over priced for the portions you get. The food is not that bad but not that good either. Would I go here again prob
5224,4,4,1,2/2/2014,"Formosa is probably the best restaurant for Chinese food in the New Haven area. I have not tried the sushi yet but the Chinese food is authentic. With that said, this place uses quite a bit of msg and their prices are on the higher end. My most recent trip was for hot pot. Its $21 dollars per person (not all you can eat but a decent amount of food). The ingredients are fresher than hot pot at Great Wall in New Haven."
5225,4,5,1,1/12/2014,"My favorite dish continues to be chili pepper tofu, but I have had takeout and eatin across a good variety of vegetarian dishes, and have never been disappointed. ˜Consistently good, versus occasionally great!"
5226,4,4,1,1/4/2014,"Formosa is one of the better Sushi places in the area. The food is always quality when I dine in. Over the years service has improved greatly. It used to take forever to get food but over the past couple of years they have been much more efficient. Take out/delivery is fast and is almost always as good as when I'm in the restaurant. The only down side is they tend to be a little more expensive then other sushi places in the area, but bottom line food is delicious and worth the extra few dollars."
5227,4,4,1,12/19/2013,Pretty good! All you can eat Sushi was fresh and got large pieces. Nice atmosphere. Will go again!
5228,4,3,1,11/25/2013,Got take out last night. Not as good as I thought. Chicken w broccoli was very over cooked and lacking in taste. Probably wouldn't ˜go back. Chicken fried rice was decent.
5229,4,4,1,10/31/2013,"Ordered delivery last night and was totally impressed with the quality and taste of the food. Fresh, flavorful and sizeable portions for a fair price and delivered quickly. Thanks yelpers for your reviews, helped me to find this gem. Chicken wonton soup with spinach is a must."
5230,4,3,1,9/17/2013,"Dan Dan noodles were really good....My husband had a spicy pork dish, but it was lacking spice as other reviewers have noted. The service was good. Will we return? Probably for take out. Those noodles were pretty good."
5231,4,5,1,7/10/2013,I don't know what Linda B. ˜Is talking about. ˜This place is still really good she must have caught them on an off night. ˜I go here quite frequently and the food is amazing. ˜The front desk host is very friendly and helpful and we always enjoy our time here. ˜I rarely use yelp but was browsing thorough my favorite resturants and was sad to see a negative review for this place so i had to speak up. ˜The flaming chicken and Bangkok tower are my two favorite dishes and they just brought back the original sushi chef (Mike) ˜so the sushi is amazing. ˜They usually have a bar tender on Friday and Saturday nights so that's a great option too. Amazing food and an amazing place. ˜Still five stars and going strong!!!
5232,4,1,1,5/28/2013,"I never write any reviews, but felt compelled to after today's experience to warn others of the decline in quality of the restaurant's food. ˜I've eaten here multiple times over the past 4 years and have always enjoyed their dishes such as the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, soups, and sushi rolls. ˜My family and I went today to celebrate my husband and mother's birthday and ordered the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, royal duck, Bangkok tower, and various soups (wonton, hot and sour, and miso). ˜My mom enjoyed her hot and sour soup, but the broth for the wonton and miso were way too salty. ˜Whereas the seafood nest had no flavor and the seafood (lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp) was overcooked and rubbery. ˜The royal duck was also overdone and tasted almost like jerky and the meat in the Bangkok tower had a burnt aftertaste. ˜Fortunately, the crispy fish was okay, but not as good as the one I've eaten there in the past. ˜The service was a bit spotty as well. ˜We asked to be served family style which they said of course to, but after bringing out the main dishes, the server took away all of our plates. ˜And upon being served our sushi roll, the server gave us only one pair of chopsticks and a single dipping dish to share between the 4 of us. ˜After we asked for more dipping dishes, the server proceeded to bring us only one large plate. ˜One of the previous reviews mention that the restaurant is under new management and it shows. ˜It's unfortunate, because this use to be such a good authentic Chinese restaurant."
5233,4,4,1,3/15/2013,Get take out for lunch all the time great sushi rolls and even better dinners. ˜Pricing is good and delivery is prompt.
5234,4,3,1,3/12/2013,Nice little place. My girlfriend and I arrived right before closing on a Friday night. Very skeptical from the start but this restaurant did the trick. We each had sushi and it was pretty decent. The service was rather mediocre however the hostess lady was extremely pleasant and even offered my gf a complimentary ice cream just as the restaurant was supposed to be closing. I think there's something to be said about friendly business like that. I'd love to give them 4 stars however the food just wasn't 4 star quality.
5235,4,2,1,11/16/2012,"Don't try anything ""fusion."" ˜It never tastes good and it's over-priced. ˜I'm told they have excellent Taiwanese dishes. ˜I don't know what qualifies as an excellent Taiwanese dish, so I won't comment there. The last time I came to Formosa, I had their all-you-can-eat sushi: very disappointing. ˜Nothing special about their sushi, and I found their menu rather limiting, especially compared to other All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, such as Sushi Palace or Sushi X. ˜Worse, they made us use the same slip of paper over and over again, telling us to just ""cross out"" our previous order. ˜This, of course, resulted in confusion for them and some of our orders never came out... or things we previously ordered but did not want a second time around would come. ˜Furthermore, it took forever for the dishes to come out. Don't come for the All-You-Can-Eat sushi or fusion dishes, but if my Taiwanese friends are right, come for their Taiwanese dishes."
5236,4,4,1,10/5/2012,I've been coming here with my family for years. ˜I've had some the best service on the weekdays. ˜Best for lunch-special style take-out and sushi deals.
5237,4,3,1,8/12/2012,I have eaten there a few times...usually pretty good. Ate there last week and they were really off their game...haven't been back since.
5238,4,5,1,7/14/2012,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. We wanted something different, and reading reviews from other yelpers convinced us to give it a try. I am so glad we did! Waitstaff, atmosphere, food, service A+ all around. The menu has a tremendous offering filled with authentic szechan items and the regular Chinese fair we in America come to expect. Also a full sushi menu. We started with pot stickers and chicken won tons (from the szechuan appetizer list). I read other reviews that recommended them. The pot stickers were some of the best I've had, and the chicken won tons were awesome. The waitress actually asked me what made me decide to order them as they are only usually ordered by people who know what they are. She was thrilled we were going to try them. Won-ton soup and hot and sour soups were delicious. For entrees we had sesame chicken and the romeo and juliet (combo of general tsos chicken and shrimp). We were in shock when they came to the table. The portion size could feed an army! At first we thought the items were a little on the expensive side being 18-20$ each. That immediately changed after our meal was served. I probably have enough left over for two lunches! Don't let the location fool you. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall. The neon lights were amusing. Inside it is anything but! Its a very nice atmosphere. I will definitely be going back in the near future to try new items. Next time we will try their sushi!"
5239,4,3,1,4/29/2012,"This pan-Asian fusion restaurant on somewhat desolate Middletown Avenue was unexpectedly good for me. ˜One look at the neon lights and I was expecting the worst, but a step into the door led to a relatively sophisticated decor and a decidedly Chinese (mostly Szechuan) inspired menu. Of course there is a sushi bar and some pan-Asian favorites on this mammoth menu, but one look at the specials -- and the fish in spicy bean sauce -- made up my mind to cut to the chase. I wasn't disappointed wish my selection. A whole, huge fresh fish was brought out steaming hot. I could not get enough of the heat and the flavor of this dish. The fish was perfectly tender and flaky. I'm glad I trusted my gut and went with the special; it was exactly that. My date had some sushi, a mango roll, which was also delicious. It was a unique take on a classic tuna roll with a healthy portion of tuna and avocado. The twist was thinly sliced mango atop the roll. The salty and sweet combination really sang once the sushi was dipped in soy sauce."
5240,4,4,1,4/25/2012,"I have eaten here a number of different times. I've dined in and have taken out. The food is consistently delicious. ˜However, make sure you go here when you have plenty of time because the service isn't that great. Everyone is always very friendly but they tend to forget about you."
5241,4,4,1,3/29/2012,"Another good asian restaurant in north haven. This is more an asian fusion and sushi restaurant than a chinese restaurant. Ive had the steak formosa, filet mignon covered in an amazing reduced wine sauce and Gorgonzola sauce. The portabella mushroom rolls and seafood wontons are also delicious. Im not a sushi eater but the ones i know say Formosa is one of the best places for sushi"
5242,4,1,1,3/24/2012,"First I want to say that the food was pretty good when we received half of what we ordered. It was the slow and inattentive service that my party received may have been because it was a Saturday and we were ordering the ""All you can eat sushi"" but I think that so matter what you order you should get at least quick service. Our evening began at 6pm when we were seating promptly and received our menu and drinks. We sent in our order and got our drinks. When our food came, we noticed that only half of it arrived. Our server came around and asked if we wanted anything else and we said we would like the rest of our order and that was the last time we saw our server for at least 30mins. We didn't even get a refill of water until our server came around with our original menu order and asked if there was anything else we needed. Again we circled and spoke to the server stating that we would like the things circled. As we waited for our server, several parties that had been seated after were getting more food, drinks, better service and were leaving while our table was just watched. Our server came back with one thing and then had to be reminded several more times just to get 2 of the 7 things that we ordered. We order fried calamari and when it came to our table it was cold a soggy. When we told our server just took it back and did not bring a new one. This whole ordeal took 2 hours and when we received our check the rate seemed to be inflated so we assumed that tip was included even though we did not think that the service that we were given. My friend left his tip on the table and we left. On our way to the car, a server (not our server) came outside looking for more tips from us. It was unbelievable that our evening was unnecessarily long, that we were leaving hungry and this restaurant wanted more money from us. I have never been someone to snub tip or be rude but I was shocked that they actually sent someone after us for more tip. As I understand it tip is suppose to be based on the quality of service you received and I think that we should have made them wait an extra 2 hours for their tip. My friends are frequent customers at this restaurant and were very excited to take me there and it was highly underwhelming and very disappointing. I would recommended it for takeout but if you are looking for all you can eat sushi ˜within a timely manner I would opt for a restaurant that cares about all the customers that come through their doors, not just the ones who order alcohol and full dinners."
5243,4,1,1,2/15/2012,"Hi there. I just want to tell you about the horrible experience I had with my family on valentines day at this restaurant. We had read multiple reviews online as well as word of mouth saying how good your restaurant is. We arrived around 6pm. We were greeted and seated. We sat and waited about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us at our table. Someone finally came over with menus and walked away. There was no introduction and he did not ask if we wanted anything to drink. About 5 minutes later a different person came over and asked what we would like to drink and if we were ready to order. We said we would like water to drink and we wanted to do the all you can eat sushi. He left the table and came back with the sushi menu and our water. We ordered shumai, teriyaki chicken, edamame and some sushi rolls. The food literally came out in 2 minutes which was quite surprising. The shumai was hard and cold and unedible. The teriyaki chicken was a grilled chicken breast with sauce glopped over the top. The sushi rice was warm which was very unapetizing but since I was about to pay over $50 for this meal I managed to choke it down. As we are eating we have no one coming over to ask how things are or if we want anything else. There were a few random people who came to clear plates away. Fast forward about another 10 minutes and a hostess seats a couple next to our table and asks if we are ready to order. We explain to her that we are a bit confused with the whole situation since we dont seem to have one person who is our waiter and she explains to us we actually have two waiters (Mike and Pho) who are sharing the duties. Ok we say we are ready to order more food. ˜So she brings over a menu which we open and realize it is the same menu we ordered our first round from. Strange we thought since we might decide to order different items. So we circle new choices which are 4 sushi rolls and some more edamame. This hostess comes back and takes the menu and we explain to her that we want what we have circled. She walks away and Mike comes back over with the same menu and we have to explain again to him that we are confused and that we circled the items we want this time. He leaves us and then we sit and wait this time for about 10 minutes for our food to come. When it comes, it is only the sushi and no edamame. We start to eat the sushi and realize that this sushi rice is warmer than the last sushi rice and we couldnt even eat it. So we leave it on the table. Mike came over at one point while we were waiting for the food and our children wanted ice cream so he brought over two bowls of vanilla ice cream for them. Once we decide we arent eating anything else we sit and wait about another 10 minutes for anyone to come over and we tell Mike we just want the check. The amount was 52.00 which honestly i was about to walk out without paying because my experience was so terrible. I wasnt sure what to do with the check so i went up to the front desk and waited for someone there. The same hostess who brought our second menu came over and took my payment. I am not sure if the staff were overwhelmed on this particular night or if this is how service usually is but i was extremely disappointed. Not only that, the food made myself and my wife sick that night. We dont plan on coming back to this restaurant and will definitely give our opinion if asked. A disappointed customer."
5244,4,3,1,1/12/2012,"Looking for someplace inexpensive to get a quick lunch, we headed down to Formosa for their lunch menu. Having never been there before, we had high hopes. The interior is decorated to give a nice atmosphere, while the exterior is dated, so don't let that deter you. The lunch menu is priced perfectly (the dinner menu was considerably more expensive) and as always, a good way to judge a place without breaking the bank. Tom had the Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce--although it had a chili pepper designating it as ""spicy"", neither of us found it to be. The sauce had great flavor and the dish was plentiful, with a tasty fried rice on the side. I had the Chili Pepper Sichuan Style with chicken--not exactly what I expected, as it was chunks of chicken sauteed with roasted jalapenos (I expected a red pepper kind of sauce). However, it was still pretty good and had a bit of heat, but nothing too overwhelming. We both had the wonton soup as well to start and were pleasantly surprised to find the wontons were stuffed with chicken instead of the traditional pork. In all, we left content. Can't say we'd come here all that often but it was a nice place to grab a quick lunch!"
5245,4,4,1,10/9/2011,Absolutely stunning food and after trying almost everything on their menu I can say it's delicious as well. When walking in you can see their kitchen is pristine and the staff are professional. The menu is expansive and even people who aren't adventurous eaters can find something amazing to order. I go on a somewhat regular basis and often bring new people each time. My only complaint would be that they seem to be short staffed so getting a hold of a waitress can prove to be tricky. Especially if there is a party in the bar.
5246,4,4,1,9/15/2011,"So much seems to have changed since the good days at Formosa. My last visit was with a party of 3 for the sushi buffet, and boy, did we have a bad experience with the service. We proceeded to sit down and tick off the little checkboxes for our orders, but then we were IGNORED. We made eye contact with a bunch of waiters/waitresses (they seem to share all the tables here), but really no one came to our aid. I understand that it was a busy night, but couldn't they have said a friendly ""We'll be with you in a minute?"" After what seemed an eternity, they took our order. The food slowly came in, but various things just didn't come. Others came in far greater portions than we had indicated. Afterwards, we indicated to a waitress that our order of the noodles didn't come. She told us that somehow that order was never entered into the system, but she has put it in now. We rounded out our meal with some ice cream, but of course they brought out the wrong flavor of ice cream. Although I'd love to believe that this was simply a bad night to go, my boyfriend went with his cousin some months ago and had the same, if not worse, treatment. It used to be that the waiters and waitresses really appeared as if they wanted to be there. Now it doesn't feel like that anymore. What happened to my favorite restaurant?!"
5247,4,3,1,8/29/2011,"After sitting down, the first thing you'll likely notice is the number of options you have - the menu is very large and, if you're like me and have limited Chinese food experience, you'll likely be unfamiliar with several of the options. Basically, if it's not cooked by General Tso, I won't recognize it. Considering this, it's useful to go with someone more familiar with this sort of cuisine to help you find the best dish. Prices are all over the place. For example, a side of edamame costs $6, which made me die a little on the inside. However, some of their other appetizers and main dishes are much more reasonably priced. I found the food to be good tasting, particularly the cumin beef. The meat was tender, and spicy enough to notice and after a while make you reach for your water glass, but not so hot that it was an exercise in pain-tolerance. I would recommend coming here if you're looking for something a little different from standard Americanized Chinese food. If you just want some pork fried rice and an egg roll, you can probably find a better deal elsewhere."
5248,4,3,1,8/29/2011,"Every time I've been to Formosa, I've gone with a friend of mine that knows the menu inside and out, so knows exactly what to order. We've always eaten 'Family Style' by just ordering a bunch of dishes and sharing, which I think is the way to go, especially with larger groups. I've really enjoyed everything I've eaten here from the cumin beef to the ma po tofu. Formosa has some great food. Unfortunately, they also have very oily food. So for those of use that have issues with oily food, it's a double edged sword. So that may affect my future visits. I think I'll try the sushi if I go again."
5249,4,5,1,8/16/2011,"The best Asian and Asian Fusion in Connecticut according to many yelpers... and they're right! From the outside, it looks like a remodeled old dive diner but by far, Formosa has been the best thing for my palate in the New Haven area. The service was good and the waitstaff all speak English. I'd recommend asking for the Chinese menu (it has translations) and skip the Orange Chicken-type American fare. The portions were good for the price (had plenty to take pack up). I haven't tried their ""fusion"" items, but will definitely be back."
5250,4,2,1,7/16/2011,"we used to go to this Restaurant often, until after some recent disappointments. The menu has gotten pricey, and the food has gone down hill its typical ""take out Chinese food"" tripled in price. The last 2 times we visited the service was terrible my daughter had to get up and find the waitress because we were waiting so long. To top it off the reason why i would never be a returning customer is because they would not allow my daughter to order from the kids menu & shes 10 & would Never be able to finish an entire meal! Way to go Formosa, to save a few bucks u just lost an entire family of customers! i must say the lunches are still good for the price~"
5251,4,4,1,4/10/2011,"Formosa is a really good restaurant that you should go to. ˜Here's why: 1. ˜They have really good Szechuan Chinese food. ˜Their cumin beef is really good as is their ma po to fu. ˜Great tasting and nice and spicy (but you can get it mild if you want it that way). 2. ˜They have some really good appetizers. ˜I really like their jjajangmyeon and they also do a fine chasiubao and also excellent fu qi fei pian. ˜:D 3. ˜Service is good. 4. ˜It's not crowded. It's definitely a favorite of mine for getting some authentic, good chinese food. ˜The place is tucked away on middletown ave so that not a whole ton of people are going there often. ˜Oh and btw, they serve sushi, too."
5252,4,3,1,3/23/2011,"I've been hoooked on their spinach & chicken wonton soup for 2 weeks. It's flavorful, identifiable, inexpensive and the broth is wonderful. ˜Their shumai wasn't shumai. It was more like a type of Thai dumpling. I didn't like it (although I love Thai dumplings). ˜The mushroom spring roll is fantab. ˜The hand rolls were a little thin but acceptable. Not great. I have yet dine-in but I look forward to the full experience."
5253,4,5,1,3/23/2011,Love their chicken wonton .. So fresh and no MYSTery meat! Lol Also try vietnam roll:)
5254,4,5,1,1/28/2011,"This ""fusion"" restaurant has been the answer to my Asian food- loving dreams! ˜While I can enjoy my customary favorites of Thai and Chinese, I also was able to get my partner to try food on the Asian side. He loves Crazy Bow-Tie pasta, a spicy hot chicken and pasta dish and is now willing to try other dishes. Ahhhh, peace reigns at last. The staff is very helpful and friendly. The food is plated in a beautiful manner often with flowers on the dish. A very relaxing dining room makes this our favorite unwinding spot."
5255,4,3,1,9/25/2010,"This is above average Chinese food and better than most other places in the New Haven area. Don't be mistaken, though: it's not great by any means. We started off with some pan-fried vegetable dumplings ($6) which were well-made and nicely presented on the plate. Next we shared a ""spicy bean curd szechuan style"" ($10) from the Chinese menu (ask for this menu specifically). Ask for it without meat; it comes with meat by default, which isn't stated on the menu. It was basically just mapo tofu, and decently made, though it could have been spicier, with the addition of some black pepper and Szechuan peppercorns. Next we had a ""broccoli in formosa black bean sauce"" ($10) which was exactly as the name suggests: broccoli in a soy-black bean sauce. Again, it was tasty, but nothing mind-blowing. Kudos to Formosa for offering brown rice (though it costs an extra $1 per small bowl). The service was friendly, though not particularly attentive or fast. The decor here is pretty nice, and this isn't a bad place to take a date, though the lights are kept way too bright. Formosa also serves unusual sushi items and a bunch of random Japanese and pasta dishes. It's like they're trying to cater to anyone and everyone. If you're sick of the subpar Chinese offerings in New Haven, Formosa might be worth the drive for you."
5256,4,2,1,8/16/2010,"We've tried Formosa a few times now, and it just hasn't lived up to our expectations. ˜Weirdly, every non-sushi dish my SO has ordered has been gorgeous but almost tasteless -- I've tasted them, and can confirm. ˜I've stuck with basic chicken dishes, and the quality's been erratic -- the broccoli and chicken, for example, was delightful once, and oily and heavy another time. ˜The sushi was good, but nothing to rave about. ˜ For more adventurous diners, they do have a menu of (what looks to us like) very authentic Chinese items, featuring for example all the inside parts of an animal that Americans seldom see, much less eat."
5257,4,3,1,8/8/2010,"Not what it was a few years ago. Used to be very cutting edge, fusion style food. ˜Now, not really much different from most Asian restaurants in the area. I had the sushi - not bad. I don't think you'd have a bad meal here, just no longer something special."
5258,4,3,1,7/31/2010,"I really enjoyed the beef with red pepper and cumin. It has a strong peppery flavor and very prominent cumin that I thought was uncommon for Asian food. We also had the shrimp with garlic sauce which was also fairly good, but definitely second fiddle to the beef dish. This place is definitely worth searching out if you're taking a road trip through Connecticut and you don't want to settle for the same old rest stop fast food."
5259,4,3,1,11/16/2009,"I came here with a LARGE group yesterday for a late lunch, (there was 18 of us total). -- place: clean, slightly above avg casual dining Chinese restaurant -- service: ˜fast, but they charge 20% tip for the large group, in fact, they charged us 23%... -- food: ˜ This place apparently specializes in Taiwanese and Szechuan food. We ordered too many dishes for me to detail everyone here. but this is a few that I remember: -- eggplant fried -- EXCELLENT, most tasty one -- Szechuan spicy tendons -- fish w/ black bean paste sauce -- Zi Ran lamb but a few of their Szechuan dishes are too spicy for my personal taste. and the egg paste soup is not really that great. -- the cold creme brulee is just another imitation dessert, don't order this one. -- pricing, if there not for the expensive $22-23 per person bill, I'd given this place a 4 star rating. But for now, it's too pricey for their food."
5260,4,2,1,8/9/2009,Slowwwww service bordering on inattentive. ˜We sat for 20 min before I had to get up and ask for the kids soup. I never received mine. ˜Food was more interesting than normal - the shumai while normally simply shrimp were spiced up with additional greens and such. Dirty plates were left lingering on our table for at least 15 min. ˜We ended up moving them to an adjacent table ourselves. ˜ A shame because the place has the feel of a joint that should have provided a much more enjoyable experience.
5261,4,4,1,7/24/2009,"Interesting decor on the outside, may turn off some, but definitely look past that and give the place a try. I'm glad I did! Service was excellent, inside the decor was more muted (read: less neon, more traditional, nice romantic feel). As a previous reviewer noted, definitely ask for the translated traditional menu if its not offered to you: lots of great authentic Sezchuan/Chengdu offerings, great if you love spicy foods! Wish they had more Taiwanese offerings, which one would have expected given their name (Taiwan originally called Formosa). Would give the place 5 stars except a tad pricey, but they do use quality ingredients and definitely far superior than most Chinese-American restaurants. Sushi was outstanding too (roll had real crab in it, not artificial crab most places use). Lunch specials are $6-8, include soup or egg roll and rice. Large portion for lunch special (easily entree size at other places, so great value)."
5262,4,4,1,5/13/2009,"Kidney, tripe, three different kinds of intestine dishes as chef's specials. Pros: Pretty unique Chinese/ Taiwanese food in Northhaven, CT. The spicy tripe appetizer, fried rice were very good. Definitely get the fried rice. Most of the chinese food in the area sucks. Cons: The intestine dish ( I think we got the one in the brown sauce) was kind of bland. I didn't care much for the consistency of the intestines. Will update review after I try some more things."
5263,4,5,1,5/1/2009,"Fantastic! We got the moo shu chicken, and it was the best I've ever had - unique and delicious...didn't even need any extra hoisin sauce! Also got the Peking duck, which I hadn't had in years and it was as delicious as I remember. For appetizers we got the roast pork bun and the scallion pancakes. Both were great. The price was reasonable, too. We got all of this for about $40. Highly recommended!"
5264,4,4,1,4/9/2009,must ask for the authentic chinese menu... the prices are on the expensive side but the dishes were absolutely yummy...and i have pretty high standards for chinese food (coming from southern CA...)...
5265,4,5,1,3/7/2009,Review is based on one visit only and I know I've only tasted a small sample. Dim Sum on Saturday (you order off a menu - no carts). Atmosphere is upscale. Tea is served in a cast iron pot. Impression of first dish was not great as dumplings were lukewarm and dipping sauce was ice cold straight out of refrigerator. The temperature of the dish was off putting but the flavor and the delicateness of the dumpling wrapping were quite good. The next 2 things I had (I only ordered 3) were out of the ballpark. Vegetable bean-curd skin roll was delicious and rice noodle wrapped shrimp was also wonderful. I enjoyed every bite. And Dr. Henry Lee and family were there also! I can't wait to go back to sample more off the menu.
5266,4,5,1,1/3/2009,"Formosa is definitely the best Asian Fusion restaurant in the state. ˜And it is hands down the best authentic Chinese restaurant in the state. ˜The staff is incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. ˜The sushi chef creates magnificent rolls--you can always tell if a restaurant is good by how neat and tight each of the sushi rolls are. ˜Formosa's sushi is artful and just a delight to eat. ˜For those interested in Chinese cuisine in CT, I can honestly say, Thank God for Formosa. ˜While some of you who are looking for a purely Chinese restaurant might be turned off by the fact that it is marketed as an Asian Fusion, you need only go once, order the Chinese food, and forever be addicted. ˜There is almost no other restaurant in its class--if you want suggestions for particular dishes, I'd be more than happy to share (too many to discuss on one review)."
5267,4,5,1,7/15/2008,"For the price and the atmosphere and everything it offered, it was definitely right on THE MONEY. The kind of place for an intimate date for two or a large rambunctious gaggle of drunks. Our girl crush date consisted of the following: ""The Warrior"" Scorpion Bowl for 2 Seaweed salad for the gal who liked it (with crispy japanese pickles for the girl who didn't) Crab cakes with lemon grass sauce and a ridiculous branch of rosemary speared through the center- hot and pipin' fresh, silly delicious A plethora of sushi rolls, including: the enchanting Mexican roll (a Mexican burrito, fajita, enchilada, chimichanga, nacho with all the fixins' ASS-MAZING!!!!!!), the American Dream roll- a perfect combination of subtle ingredients much like the persona of the American spirit with red, white, and blue tobiko; and finally the Spice Girl Roll chosen for its name rather than its ingredients, was equally enchanting and on par with our friends from the south's tortilla Mexican roll. Next the fatties were still hungry and the scorpion bowl wouldn't die! From the secret, special Chinese Taiwanese menu we ordered a delicious dish of chicken with abalone mushrooms which intrigued us and caused us to question the truth and realities of culinary arts for all eternity. If you understood this review- BRAVA! If not please take me to dinner at Formosa and we will make delicious Asian Fusion of Love for Buddha to savor. Very nice."
5268,4,5,1,6/4/2007,"The BEST restaurant in North Haven hands down. ˜The dining room is spacious and the wait staff is great. ˜The food is downright AWESOME. ˜I have had both sushi and their pan asian meals. ˜A few favorites are the Szechuan raviolis, Mexican Roll, Green Tea Tuna, Szechuan Veggies, I could go on and on :) If they are offering the banana spring rolls for desert do not pass them up. ***Edit 1/8/08*** Make sure and ask for the ˜""Chinese menu"" which has both authentic Szechuan and Taiwanese food. ˜That is the only menu we order off of since we found out about it. ˜The food is the best I have ever had!!! ˜The water boil beef is great but specify you want it the way it supposed to be HOT :) ˜There is dim sum on Saturday and Sunday in the afternoon. ˜It is awesome as well. ˜ Also, ˜one night we saw Doctor Henry Lee here ! ˜Cool!!!"
5269,4,5,1,4/16/2007,"There is this ˜Asian restaurant that is so wonderful. Its right down the street ˜from ˜where I live and for the first time I had a California ˜Roll that contains rice, seaweed wrap crab meat its not raw and avocado. I was scared at first then a friend of mine said if ˜don't want to try sushi try the California Roll. I did and I am hooked. The service is good and they even have happy hour3-6 pm. ˜Hey try this place out ˜I did. want to have a big gathering they have a party room up to 70 people."
5270,5,4,1,12/2/2014,Checked out this spot in Newark. Staff was very friendly. They gave us some bread at the table that was delicious. I had the angel hair with vodka and shrimp. Food was great and the portion was huge for lunch time.
5271,6,2,0,7/20/2012,I had a sub from here and was AWFUL the lady gave the ends of the meat in the sub like chunks horrible. The place is dirty and needs a remodel AVOID people
5272,6,4,0,4/16/2013,got a few subs other day ... ˜good food ˜ quick delivery
5273,6,4,0,12/1/2009,I eat here all the time. The food is good and the staff is helpful. Service is always top notch.
5274,6,1,1,11/30/2014,Horrible horrible customer service. I literally just walked out because of the clerks' attitudes. Never seen anything like it. No thank you.
5275,6,1,1,9/16/2014,"I work near Subworks and often place large sub orders to feed my staff for lunch when we are working on Saturdays. ˜Yesterday, I placed an order at 11:45 am to be delivered at 1:00 pm. ˜It was an order for 8 subs, which is smaller than the orders I usually place. ˜At 12:55, I received a call from Stephanie saying my order wasn't going to be ready for 1:00 pm. ˜I said ""that's ok, how long do you think it will be?"". ˜She put Barbara, the manager, on the phone. ˜Barbara proceeded to complain to me that they are too busy working on an order that was placed before mine for 40 subs and repeated that my order would not be ready. ˜I asked her why I wasn't told when I called that they were too busy to fill my request. ˜I would have called another place. ˜She responded with, ""so do you want to cancel the order?"". ˜Of course I had to cancel it because my staff was going to break for lunch in 5 minutes and I had no food to give them. ˜Barbara did not once apologize for their mistake and instead made me feel like my order was a huge inconvenience for her. ˜Well, I won't be ordering from or visiting Subworks ever again. Barbara won't have to worry about my orders being an inconvenience to her ever again! To the owner of Subworks, I'm sorry to inform you that you have a lousy manager who has caused you to lose future business because of her incredibly rude way of speaking to good customers."
5276,6,3,1,1/17/2014,"Small place. ˜There is seating, but there's no atmosphere. ˜Great for take-out sandwiches."
5277,6,4,1,12/21/2013,Meatballs with angel hair Al vodka. $11.50. Comes with small salad and bread. Great if you're hungry. Takes about 30 minutes to make. ˜Call ahead.
5278,6,5,1,12/20/2013,"Subworks is one of the quietest food franchise around some states or possibly nation. I believe when I say the food was good, I mean it. I had visited and eaten there many, many times. My first order from the restaurant was a Turkey Sub with lettuce, pepper, salt, vinegar and olive oil or regular oil. When I say good, that was freaken explosive freshness in my taste buds. Compared to those corner stores that are also deli but this franchise really does have it. Sometimes when I don't dine with friends, I ask for tomatos and it just tasted 1000x tastier. Speaking about it makes my mouth all watery! They have a great variety of foods from soups, subs, pizza, sandwiches, etc. also the staff here are very friendly and interactive. :)"
5279,7,1,0,7/21/2013,"I used to love this place when it was Xunta-a very authentic Spanish tapas bar, casual, informal bar with tapas and a great atmosphere - so I went for years, bringing many out of town visitors and friends for happy hour and on weekends. Now, sadly, I have to say that Nai is not the same place and not worth spending your money there. The new owner has made a lot of changes, for the worse, imo, and is very strange (looks like some dude from Queens)-he seems to be always there,with a scowl on his face, is neither inviting nor welcoming, and acts dismissive and like he is ˜doing you a favor even talking to ˜you-when we even show up early for reservations and have done nothing except wanting to patronize his bar! He runs the place like a formal dining restaurant..it feels like you have to be in exactly on time, spend your pricepoint, and get out-all very anti-tapas bar to me. At my ˜birthday celebration of 10 people, he actually did ask us to leave after 2 hours because he ""needed"" the table though we had spent several hundred dollars and were still eating and drinking! I was flabbergasted at how rude that was. ˜Also I noticed that since the change to Nai, the food is not as good as it used to be (octopus and other dishes not cooked well), with higher prices as well, and the sangria is now also watered down/sweet imo--just not a good value. And the d?cor now is blah (think tacky flamenco paintings from homedecorators.com)-does not have any of the charm or personality of the old Xunta. Sadly, after giving it a go a couple of times, I am in search once again of an authentic Spanish tapas bar."
5280,7,2,0,9/24/2012,Unremarkable - tried about 8 dishes expecting all to blow my socks off given the high reviews but was I mislead by the Yelp rating! Does not hold a candle next to Boqueria.
5281,7,2,0,3/6/2012,Pros -Decent value -Friendly and kind service -Accommodates large groups Cons -Tons of loud groups -Not intimate at all
5282,7,3,0,8/21/2012,Nothing special.
5283,7,3,0,2/9/2012,"Came here on a date Saturday night. We had a reservation but since we were 10 minutes late (well, my DATE was ten minutes late...) we had to wait a while for a table. So they put us downstairs at the bar and it was packed. When I say packed, it was more crowded than any other restaurant I've been to in New York. ˜We were 10 feet away from the bar in the room the size of my apartment (not big) with people eating their meals on all sides of us. I felt bad for them since my ass was right in their face. I don't understand why they try and accommodate so many people at once when there's no room. Anyway, after about half an hour we got a table. This was the table closest to the main entrance, and I would not recommend it. I think my chair got kicked at least 20 times throughout the night. I did enjoy the fact that they had live music and a cigar roller workin all night. I wanted to see if he could roll something else up for me after dinner since he had all the tools and looked damn good at it but felt like that might not be the best decision. The food was good, no complaints but I don't think I'll be back here on a Friday or Saturday night. Best to try on a slower night when it's not so packed."
5284,7,4,0,10/27/2014,"the place has a nice vibe, the tapas are delicious and reasonably priced. i went there with a friend on a thursday night around 7:30 pm, right before the flamenco show. we had a great time looking at performance, the sangria is one of the best one i've had lately, and the service was friendly."
5285,7,4,0,6/18/2014,"I came here with two other people for a book club meeting. It was happy hour, so we ordered a $10 half-pitcher of mango sangria, which was DELICIOUS. Also, almost all the food we ordered (tortilla, potatos w/ aioli, tropical salad) was flavorful and well-made. My friends ordered the chorizo with onions, which looked and smelled good, too (I didn't have any because I'm a vegetarian). The only exception was the asparagus tapas, which was actually pretty gross--I had to force myself to eat it because I hate wasting food. There were only two small pieces of asparagus, which were horribly overcooked and mushy (possible from a can), very cold, and drenched in mayonnaise. Our waiter was very friendly and engaging when we arrived, and did a cool long pour of the sangria, though he seemed to forget about us later on. But overall, this was a positive experience and I recommend this place."
5286,7,4,0,5/30/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!"
5287,7,4,0,9/3/2013,"The food dont only tast terrific, but is also put on the place in such a charming way. You eat with your eyes to and theese peope knows it! Staff is nice, serviceminded and easy to get their attention without feeling like you are ignored. Nice! I'll be back ofcourse!"
5288,7,4,0,6/18/2013,"I had my birthday dinner here with a group of 11. I made the original reservation for 8, and had a few extras show up. The staff accommodated my party with a larger table on a busy Friday night. The sangria was amazing, and the food was absolutely delicious. Everyone at the table raved. I'll definitely be back."
5289,7,4,0,11/19/2012,"The manager here was really nice and was very accommodating when our party of 8 turned into a party of 10! We were there Thursday night, so the flamenco dancers were there and incredible!!!"
5290,7,4,0,8/10/2012,"Excellent spot, not much to add to the other reviews."
5291,7,4,0,4/10/2012,Made me happy really happy with that little cute look and fantastic food
5292,7,4,0,1/23/2012,"Food was Really good, Service was on point (it was a bit early and quiet though) and the price was reasonable."
5293,7,4,0,12/31/2010,"We have been there twice in three weeks; the first night it was a Tuesday early so there was hardly anyone there. ˜But we were impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly staff. ˜We returned two weeks later on the evening with the Flamenco dancing, got a seat right next to the dance floor. ˜It was a great evening--the food was good, the mango sangria was very good. ˜An uneven table caused a quite accidental drink spill and the waiter responded graciously with towels...and a free pitcher of sangria! ˜We stayed for three hours, had four or five tapas, watched a first rate floor show...and got out for less than $100 for two. ˜We will definitely be back many times."
5294,7,5,0,6/25/2014,"Perfect Flamenco performance. Good food, but not enough. It's ok just order more, more more... Delicious Sangrias. This place is not good for a first date..., I guess it's obvious. The music is loud and there are too many distractions. Else, it is a perfect place to chill either solo or with a group of people."
5295,7,5,0,4/14/2014,I really love this place! The service is excellent and the food and sangria is delicious! I've never had a bad experience coming here. It's small and cozy and it's a great atmosphere all around.
5296,7,5,0,3/4/2014,"Service: Attentive, personable, accommodating Decor: Cool, enchanting, laid-back Food: Phenomenal, addictive, delicious In a word: Amazing! Anytime I wanted to ask for something, BOOM: there it was before I could finish turning my head! A napkin, more bread, water. Amazing! Both times I've been over the past few months the staff has been exceptional. We tried all different items the two times we've been (expect for the Pollo al Aljillo - WOW!!!) and almost everything was mouthwateringly delicious."
5297,7,5,0,11/12/2013,The service here is AMAZING. Very attentive and friendly staff- this is very rare in a fairly priced restaurant. Their garlic shrimp is amazing- must devour all of the sauce!
5298,7,5,0,10/23/2013,"Nai tapas is my local favorite, I have gone back at least 5 times in the past three months. Try to make it there for happy hour and get a pitcher or half pitcher of their sangria. It may not be strong but it's tasty and goes well with the 3-4 orders of tapas you shoul get there (or more depending on the group size). Tropical and mango are definitely my favorite nai tapas sangria flavors and highly recommend trying both especially if you like fruity flavors. Some menu favorites I always go back for: -Patatas Bravas -Croquetas de pollo -Mejillones Rias Baixas Also stop in for the amazing service :) the staff really makes an attempt to check on you and get to know you. I always love introducing new friends to this place for that and the amazing flamenco shows they have on Thursdays (I think they also have one over the weekend) but I've only seen the one on Thursday and it is truly a magnificent experience. You can't take pictures (it's distracting) which is a good thing because it's something worth experiencing through the naked eye."
5299,7,5,0,12/1/2012,"Everything on the menu here is great. My favorite are the chipirones in their own ink, the bacalaos, the stuffed olives, the salteado de gambas, and pretty much everything I've tried! The entire staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. I also love that ˜their food is always served HOT. The best part, though, is that it's a pretty cheap place to eat."
5300,7,5,0,9/3/2012,"Late last year my wife and I were in the East Village looking for a Galician tapas and found ˜Nai. It was a Saturday afternoon, in between meal times, and the place had few customers. We sat down at a high stool table, looked at the decently priced wine list (mostly Spanish and Argentine good wines), ordered some tempranillo, and we proceeded to tackle some pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod (to die for), some grilled sardines (delicious), some exquisite cod croquettes and then, la piece de resistance, octopus Galician style (sauteed in olive oil and with piment›n/paprika: just like in Galicia). At ˜$5 to $6 for a tapa or about $11 for a raci›n (double the size of the tapa), food of this caliber is a steal when compared with trendier or faux-upscale similar establishments catering to Catalan or Basque tapas in the West Village. The best way to appreciate Nai is to sit in your high table, have a bottle, let the tapas flow, and see and absorb the young atmosphere. And so we found ourselves returning to Nai several times. Last night, we visited again for the pimientos de piquillo stuffed with cod; croquettes of goat cheese wrapped in jam›n serrano (delicious); meatballs in brandy (quite tasty); grilled chorizos (just as it reads, which left us wanting next time for the chorizos in an onion sauce and chorizo in cider), and toppled with a desert of fresh lime-laced strawberries stuffed with custard (exquisite). It is heartening that we still have so many items in the menu to work through..... What brings us back to Nai? ˜Is it the young and low-key atmosphere which seems so true to form to tapas places in university towns like Santiago de Compostela? ˜Is it the warm and attentive treatment at the hands of David (the owner) or Raœl, the genial attendant from the Basque country? ˜Is it the high quality Galician tapas that are thoroughly authentic, like back in Galicia, without contamination or ""adjustments"" to fit ""what the NY market would expect""? I don't know (but who's asking?) ˜One think for sure: the way David and his co-owner chef constantly and solidly deliver the goodies, I don't think that I will have to worry for a while about high-priced debatable experiments involving chorizos toppled with mango and cilantro, just to appear hip. Nai delivers what is truly needed in NY: a real, authentic tapas place from Galicia, authentic to its roots in food and ˜ambiance, all for very good value. Keep it up, guys! Well be baaaack!!"
5301,7,5,0,8/26/2012,"I've been to Nai a few times now and it always winds up being the perfect night out. First of all, the service is really top-notch. You're always greeted right away and the staff seems so efficient. The other night we enjoyed two small pitchers of sangria, the champagne and the mango. Both were excellent but the champagne is definitely my favorite. As for food, we shared six tapas. It was the perfect amount for two people. Prices were really reasonable as well. Can't wait to go back already."
5302,7,5,0,8/21/2012,"been here last may and came back for a friends birthday. food is great, service is outstanding and the dancers are very good. ill keep coming ass long as they keep delivering, thanks nai tapas!"
5303,7,5,0,8/19/2012,"sweet! Large menu, with so many choices! excellent service, extremely attentive and very knowledgeable. the dancing was just OK, too loud. will go back when they don't have the flamengo."
5304,7,5,0,7/6/2012,love it! great food and amazing prices. fantastic staff. ˜flamenco shows. killer happy hour prices & ideal location. what more could you want?
5305,7,5,0,6/14/2012,"My group From Grapes to Glass did a wine crawl on Saturday afternoon in the East Village and Nai Tapas was our next to last stop. They were able to accommodate our large group and we took over the bar and tables in the window. Nai Tapas hands down is the best place in the city for tapas!! I have tried everything on the menu and it is all delicious!! I suggested that everyone try the sangria because it is insane and is always lip smacking good. They also offer an excellent selection of spanish wines, so everyone in the group had something new and delicious to try. I love the atmosphere and somehow they manage to be a great location for groups and dates. They have live flamenco dancing and the place gets super lively. So much fun. We ate and drank our lions share and all agreed that everyone would be back to Nai Tapas. Thanks to Nai Tapas!! Viva la Grape!!"
5306,7,5,0,12/12/2011,"This is an awesome restaurant for large parties! ˜Raoul, the sweetly charming and attentive host, made my birthday truly festive and memorable. ˜The champagne sangria, the asparagus, the croquettes and the octopus were delicious and reasonably priced. ˜I would come back with my friends anytime I wanted a comfortable atmosphere, good drinks and a bill that does not ruin the evening. ˜I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for 8 with no problem."
5307,7,5,0,11/21/2011,"I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. From the great food and service, Nai does not disappoint. I recommend their mango sangria, which I have never had before until I tried it there, along with the octopus and ham croquettes. Their desserts are just as good, with the creme brulee ice cream or the almond tart."
5308,7,5,0,7/20/2011,I decided to impress my new mother and father in-law by taking them to a nice dinner. I didn't have to think too much before I knew Nai Tapas would be the PERFECT place. I was DEFINITELY right! From the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away. We had a table right in front of the live Flamenco band which was a plus. We ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next. The tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing! I know I scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to Nai Tapas!
5309,7,5,0,7/20/2011,"AMAZING! My bridal party took me to Nai Tapas for dinner for my bachelorette party and all of us had the BEST time! The food was DELICIOUS and the sangria was even better!! The flamenco show was the perfect touch and ALL staff was very attentive and polite. I definitely recommend Nai Tapas for a night out in the city if you are looking for fantastic food, great service, and live entertainment!!!!"
5310,7,5,0,6/15/2011,"Amazing place with amazing service. We had the best time enjoying tapas and the show. The tapas were delicious and the sangria was delicious but more like juice rather than an alcoholic drink. The show on saturday night was absolutely one of the best flamenco shows I've ever seen. The performances lasted a few hours, it was amazing to see the women dance full of passion and energy. We all had an amazing time and I can't wait to come back."
5311,7,5,0,5/23/2011,"Simply the best in NYC!!! Go, eat, drink, enjoy."
5312,7,5,0,5/22/2011,"An amazing find. I was looking for a restaurant to celebrate my birthday with a group of 12. I also wanted to find a spot that had a flamenco show on Saturdays. As soon as I came in to make reservations, I knew this place would be great. The decor is great; it's an intimate, low-lit place with exposed brick walls. Dinner was amazing. The best part was definitely the flamenco show. It is free, and lasts for hours. The dancers and singers were top notch!!! I felt like I was back in Madrid watching a show. The service was also amazing; with such a big group, our waiter was always available, smiled, and served us very quickly. The food was good, and there is a big variety of sangria. The prices for the tapas were also very reasonable. There is a flamenco show every Thursday & Saturday at 8:30. It is a must!"
5313,7,5,0,4/5/2011,"I was there on Saturday night with three friends and what a great place! ˜We ate a total of eight tapas, had two pitchers of sangria and we each paid around twenty dollars with tip included. ˜Great food, great service, low prices and an awesome flamenco show. ˜We will definitely be back."
5314,7,5,0,1/2/2011,"WOW - Double WOW. What a place to spend an evening eating and drinking. The Sangria's are 1st class, and the tapas cannot be beat anywhere in Manhattan, or the other boroughs. Great Flamenco on Thursday's and Saturday Great place and very freindly wait staff and bartender. This was my 2nd trip, and there will be many, many more"
5315,7,5,0,12/24/2010,A couple of friends and I ate there last night and it was terrific. ˜Absolutely loved the food and the service was exceptional. ˜What can I say even the prices were right. ˜We can't wait to go back and see the Flamenco show.
5316,7,3,1,1/7/2015,"Happy hour deals are hard to beat -- $3 beers, $4 house wine, $5 sangria (different flavors) and $20 pitchers! The food was OK, the gambas ajillo disappointing, but anchovy stuffed olives and croquettes jamon were delicious! Portions are good for trying alot of different tapas. Want to try the empanalillos and clams next time."
5317,7,2,1,1/2/2015,The food was absolutely delicious. I was with a group for a birthday and we ordered basically one of everything and each dish came out even better than the one before. The service was pretty good and was overall satisfied. My one issue is that two bottles of champagne were ordered and were never brought out. That wouldn't have been a problem if we weren't charged for them off the bill after the fact. We aired our grievance with the restaurant who were very apologetic and we were promised a mailed check - a month later and we still have not received the money.
5318,7,5,1,1/1/2015,Great sangria and atmosphere
5319,7,4,1,12/30/2014,"I went there on a Thursday night and had a great time enjoying the flamenco show. The tapas are quite good and so is the sangria. Its not the most authentic tapas I have ever had and the flamenco is not extraordinary. However, very good value for the price. Would definitely go back."
5320,7,3,1,12/25/2014,"No jamon iberico on the menu but they do have Estrella on tap. ˜The potatoes with tomato sauce is a little on the spicy side, but still a great starter app."
5321,7,3,1,12/23/2014,"Ate here on Friday with my finance and have mixed feelings on the restaurant. ˜The service was amazing. ˜Our waiter was great - very friendly and happy to answer questions. ˜They have a HH that ends around 7pm with good deals on sangria, wine, and beer. ˜We tried the red wine sangria which I enjoyed. ˜ The food wasn't great. ˜We had the following: Garlic shrimp - probably our favorite dish Chicken Croquettes - very cheesy, almost with a velveeta-like texture. ˜I didn't love these Chorizo (chistorra envuelta) - nothing great, but not terrible Fried goat cheese - It's served on bread with tomato. ˜I wish the bread was toasted. ˜The tomato and bread doesn't really add much Seafood crepe - this was just ok Meatballs - second to the garlic shrimp but one of the better dishes we had I can see how this would be good for groups, especially if you are taking advantage of the HH deal. ˜If you're there with just one other person they sort of squish you in next to other couples/pairs. ˜I also wish the restaurant was a little darker. ˜The decorations are just ok but a darker room would have added a little bit of ambiance. Don't think I'd go back."
5322,7,5,1,12/20/2014,"Great place. Found it from reviews on Yelp. A great find. Food was a amazing. Everything came out fresh and hot. We tried a lot lol. We had the mango sangria very good flavor and fruit was nice. We tried the shrimp in garlic, yummmm. The cod dips, hamon croquetas, oxtail, tuna empanadas and the coconut crepe with seafood. All of these dishes were amazing. The atmosphere was perfect. A little loud but it was filled with people eating, drinking and having a great time. Great for a date, friends, family and maybe strangers. Lol. We talked with the people at the table next to us and had a great conversation about crazy things. Only in New York. They ordered alot of food for just 4 people but everything they had looked sooo good and prices are very reasonable. ˜They have flaminco dancing Thurs and Sat nites. Servers were very nice and very attentitive. I live in Bklyn and will definitely come back and with friends. Go check it out."
5323,7,5,1,12/19/2014,"Went here to celebrate a friend's birthday and the tapas were pretty damn good! ˜ ˜I think we had 2 pitchers of san gria (which are the bomb) ˜ordered a few ˜tapas and the price wasn't bad. Tapas we ordered: Pelotillas De Queso De Cabra: Croquetas De Pollo Patatas Bravas Pintxo De Chistorra Con Huevo De Codorniz pulpo a la gallega There was also a steak with mango sauce (not sure if it was a tapas or plate), but we were sharing everything. ˜ I like that we can have the small or large portion as well. Service was really good. ˜ We did come here on a Tuesday evening so it was a low key crowd. ˜ ˜Would definitely come here again. I usually eat tapas in san francisco at places like lolinda, coqueta and cha cha cha. ˜ I feel this is a more casual venue of these places but the food still is on par - I would even rate it better than cha cha cha."
5324,7,5,1,12/16/2014,"Friends and I were at Nai on Friday night. This restaurant has the perfect ambiance and amazing food. The four of us shared about 10 plates and it was more than enough food. My favorites were the shrimp in garlic and the fried feta cheese wrapped in ham. We also tried the meatballs, clams in spicy sauce, mussels, croquettes and patatas bravas. I would recommend all of these dishes! Hopefully we will be back to this restaurant next time we are in the city."
5325,7,4,1,12/15/2014,"My rating for this restaurant is based not solely on the food, but also for the live Flamenco music and dance performance. We came here with a fairly large group on a Saturday night (make reservations ahead of time for large parties, this is a very small place!). For parties larger than 10 people it is a pre-fix menu of $45 a person which includes 2 hours of unlimited drinks and a number of appetizers. For an authentic tapas place, the appetizers we had were sub par. ˜I feel like they weren't for the serious ""foody"", but the Sangria was delicious. I cannot comment on their full regular menu, so I will have to come back and order a la carte. The Flamenco show was fantastic! The music is amazing and the dancing is beautiful, raw, authentic Flamenco. Being a dancer, this was a great experience all around. I would recommend this to anyone who likes Flamenco music or even for just a girls night out, date night or bringing your parents somewhere cool."
5326,7,5,1,12/14/2014,"This place is GREAT!!! My friends and I went for dinner, but ended up having a few apps because we were unable to make a decision. We had skirt steak, grilled shrimp in garlic sauce, octopus in virgin olive oil, fried goat cheese and braised ox tail = AMAZING, food was hot & fresh. As far as drinks we ordered a pitcher of Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria that was absolutely DELICIOUS * =] Service was AWESOME!!! Also, make sure you reserve a table; the place is a bit tight and does get crowded on the weekends so be prepared for a crowd and wait."
5327,7,5,1,12/2/2014,"We came here for a special occasion and absolutely loved it! I chose here because I wanted make sure everyone get to choose something of their liking and I am so glad I did. Our waiter was so nice to us! He was good with making recommendations based on our preferences and also making sure we were good with the portions we were getting. I had a reservation here and they originally put us in a small table next to the window but we requested to be moved to a more spacious area next to the bar. At some point during dinner, it felt more so like a dive bar because the TV was on. But it was good nonetheless. They gave us a lot of bread and good olive oil to go with it. The bacalao frito was not bad. My favorite was its grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. So good! I was convinced to try caracoles...and I was right to be skeptical. I didn't like it. The beef stew was the best though! Must try! I also tried the sangria and it was HH price. ˜All in all, I had a blast! By the time we departed around 9pm, there was a line waiting outside. This place is good for couples or small groups. I highly recommend this place!"
5328,7,4,1,11/29/2014,"This is a cute tapas bar! I came here Friday night for a 9:15pm reservation. (Heads up: we just came from the Regal Union Square movie theater and the distance wasn't too far, so if you're thinking of a dinner and a movie for a date -- you're welcome.) However, we arrived a little early - 9pm to be exact - and I guess because it was so busy in there, we had to wait those 15 minutes until our table was ready. My party of 5 didn't mind waiting, but it got a bit annoying because there was no place to wait except for the doorway and the waiters had to constantly say, ""Sorry, excuse me,"" each time they needed to go around us...yeah, it's a pretty small bar. Lesson learned: just be there exactly in time for your reservation. Here's what my table ordered: - Tortilla Espanola (potato omelette pie): sadly, really plain. Just literally an omelette with potato. Supposed to taste like: ""Oh my gosh, how have I not mixed eggs and potato into a pie before?"" But it tasted like: ""Oh, eggs and potato together. All right."" - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak): My table ordered the tapas size (9 pieces). Let's just say after we ate finished it, we ordered the racion size (15 pieces). DO NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. The steak is so tender ... I'm just drooling about it now. - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs): surprisingly delicious. It's like you never even see it coming! - Solomillo a la Naranja (pork tenderloin): also delicious! the sauce really makes it great. - Tabla de Jamon y Queso (charcuterie): as much as I love charcuterie, skip out on this one. There were 6 pieces of rolled up ham and 6 triangles of Machego cheese. This costs $15. It was a really depressing plate... - Seafood Paella: Depends on this one. If you're a sticky rice kind of person, this is the paella for you. If you don't, it's not. And I know, I sound ridiculous for saying this, but if there was meat in here, it would have made a huge difference. But there isn't so it's not the best paella, but for $17 it's pretty cheap. - Patatas Bravas (spicy potato cubes): very spicy, but very good! We also ordered the Mango and White pitchers of Sangria. Each pitcher was about $28 each. I mainly chose this place for the pitchers of sangria (clearly my priorities are in order) and both were great! Overall, I had a fun experience. The waiters were attentive and really nice. Oh! There's free bread with olive oil. And yes, my party was the one that kept asking for refills -- which the waiters gave with a smile on their faces! I am definitely coming here again (how did I miss those GAMBAS?!) since the prices were pretty decent for a tapas place (total bill for 5 people: $190 including tip - about $38 a person). Cailin's Recommendations: - Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs)"
5329,7,4,1,11/24/2014,"Went for sangria and tapas for a friend's birthday. Made a reservation for 6:30 PM on Thursday night. One of my friends got there on time while the rest of us were running late. She was able to be seated which was really nice - she didn't have to wait for the whole party to arrive. We ordered the pomegranate blueberry sangria which was tasted fruity and fresh. It was still happy hour so the entire pitcher cost $20. Then we proceeded to order six tapas (small plates) to split between three of us. The waiter was concerned it would not be enough food but we were entirely satisfied with our ordering. Standout dishes were the shrimp in garlic sauce (ahhh that sauce!), potatoes with the garlic aioli, and the fried goat cheese. We loved all the dishes though. Savory, comfort food. Each dish cost between $5-8, so 6 dishes was not overly expensive. Overall, a really great meal. We all left determined to go back another time. Highly recommended!"
5330,7,4,1,11/22/2014,"I went to Nai two months ago with an old friend. It's a cute place tucked underground off of 1st Ave and 11th. Going off the server's recommendation, we did enjoy the Gambas al Ajillo; pretty much anytime you douse something in garlic sauce I'm gonna like it. The rest of the meal was enjoyable - I've had most of the dishes before, but I remember enjoying every one. We also showed up right at the tail end of happy hour - we ended up getting a discounted pitcher of sangria, and it was pretty good (I've never really had a sangria I've loved, but this was close). Prices were reasonable for the neighborhood. I'd recommend this place for folks looking for tapas in the area. Would be good with a very small group or on a date."
5331,7,4,1,11/20/2014,"Went here for my birthday recently and the food was amazing! We all shared dishes so I tried many- they were tasty and very good. The service was also awesome, really enjoyable experience! When I went it wasn't too crowded, but I can see it getting packed since it's not a huge space. They also have great drink specials."
5332,7,5,1,11/13/2014,If you've ever visited Spain this is the place to go! Live Flamenco every Thursday and Saturday night! Amazing tapas and sangria is on point! A bit pricey but worth the money especially with the live performance!
5333,7,4,1,11/12/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!"
5334,7,5,1,11/2/2014,"Had my 25th birthday here last night and it was AMAZING! The food was delicious and the service couldn't have been any better. They were so nice and accommodating and made my birthday so special. If you're in the area you absolutely have to go here! I will definitely be back with a big group of friends. Also, you should Def get the mango sangria and skirt steak! You won't regret it."
5335,7,4,1,11/2/2014,"I like the flamingo performance on Thursday night. The performance was well-prepared. The dancer even warmed herself up half an hour before the show. The food is good with fair price and size. The service is attentive. Just want to remind ppl the show starts at 8:30 on Thursday. If u want to see the show, better to mention it when you make reservation."
5336,7,3,1,10/26/2014,Live Flamingo dancer!! Best part of the night. The service was quick and the food was decent.
5337,7,5,1,10/25/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! Great vibe, great food, love that the plates are so small, but so extremely delicious! The blueberry sangria is my favorite! Amazing staff! Moved back to California, I miss this place so much! Highly recommend!"
5338,7,1,1,10/20/2014,"It's going to be really hard to write this review, the rating is not because of the food or drinks, those were really good. But I do appreciate when a good manager keeps the staff in checked. When we got there we were told that the pitcher of sangria was $10 in happy hour. We order 2 pitchers before 7pm, among several plates. When it was time to pay the bill, our surprise was seeing the pitchers at full price. And when I asked about it the waiter tells me that the one at that price is the half pitcher. At this point all I wanted to do is talk to the manager, and the waiter in a very rude manner approached us, and claiming that it was a misunderstanding and miscommunication grabbed the bill (which was handwritten) and tore it right there in front of us. As I see things, if it was a mistake (totally posible) I would have fix the pitcher value as a way to say sorry and let the customer pay the bill. At this point with no bill I couldn't pay it, couldn't talk to the manager and no tip for the waiter of course after that behavior. It seems very dubious to me and my friends that this guys destroyed the bill without trying to come up with another solution and talk about it. I consider myself a very understanding costumer but I don't answer good to rudeness and when I feel some type of dishonesty is happening I can't let it go. Hopefully this was a one person thing and I had bad luck."
5339,7,4,1,10/10/2014,"Their Flamenco dancers on thursday nights had me out way past my bed time. Not to mention the $20 happy hour (until 7) pitchers of sangria - we ordered 3 flavors with the pomegranate blueberry champagne and red being my favorites! Food: delicious gambas, patatas bravas, paella, mussels, sausage and onions, and can't forget the manchengo cheese."
5340,7,5,1,10/9/2014,"The East Village makes me angry but Nai Tapas makes me happy. It also makes travelling below 14th street totally worth it. Their appetizers are perfect. Not many things in the world are perfect, but I feel good knowing that Nai Tapas has perfect tapas. Every time I have gone there, I've had an awesome experience. Some of my favorites include the shrimp in garlic sauce and their clams and mussels. I can eat that all day. The only difficulty in eating here is that you're supposed to share tapas (so I've been told), but if you're anything like me -you'll want to hog everything. Go there, enjoy the sangria and the tapas and the vibe of all the people around you. This place is always awesome"
5341,7,5,1,10/8/2014,"Great place to have tapas, great sangr­a (not to sweet, thank you!). The food comes out quickly and the staff is very, very nice. Thank you for the lovely evening. On saturdays and sundays you have to make a reservation, the place is full because of the Flamenco performance."
5342,7,3,1,10/7/2014,"We strolled in here when another restaurant had over a 50 min wait. This had none especially by the bar. Actually glad I came when there was no flamenco show mostly because I needed some quiet after an insane day at a work conference. We had a pitcher of sangria, which was alright. We shared some tapas, which were all alright. The best was the octopus tapa. Some of the others were unmemorable. The tapas version of the paella was meh. I wasn't a fan and it definitely tasted like the steel pan. All I could taste was metal. Wouldn't recommend it. The waiter was nice though. So, it's alright. Not sure I'd rush back here."
5343,7,4,1,10/5/2014,"Came here for a birthday dinner and we tried an assortment of tapas till we were busting at the seams: shrimp with garlic, calamari in its own ink, fried cod fish, mussels, sardines on toast, paella, cheese plate, chorizo, clams, ... the list can go on! Good food, friendly service, prices OK, not cheap, though. Unfortunately, we missed out on the flamenco show but there's always next time!"
5344,7,4,1,10/4/2014,"This is the first of what I can only imagine would be many trips here. Pitchers are $20 and glasses are $4. We had just eaten so we were not interested in food (plus I'm more interested in liquid calories come happy hour time). As a group of 4, we decided to come here one night for happy hour which runs until 7pm. We easily sat at the bar and began chatting up the bartender, Dave. He was very friendly and instantly was joking with us. We only had a little over an hour left of happy hour so we had to choose wisely on what pitchers to get. We started with blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. It was delicious and it quickly disappeared. Round two: We got just a simple red sangria. Delicious and also quickly vanished. I finally found a magic act I enjoyed! But wait there is more. Around 640, we received a THIRD pitcher of mango sangria. I love mango so this was right up my alley. By this time, I opted to break the seal thinking happy hour was over. Boy was I wrong. By the time I returned, Dave granted us one last pitcher of tropical sangria. Again very good but this was a little too sweet from what I think i remember. Now let's do the math, albeit improperly. 4+4=1. 4 people, 4 pitchers, all in just over one hour. Not too shabby. They were decently strong, but we are all pros at sangria-ing. By the time we left there was a line of people waiting for dinner. I'm not sure if I would have a sit down dinner but I would definitely return for a pitcher or two at the bar and maybe a few plates of tapas for good measure."
5345,7,4,1,10/2/2014,"Their dark wood tables and chairs give a very cozy feel. ˜ Hard to resist the $20 for a pitcher of sangria during their happy hours. ˜And the sangria wasn't bad at all, and we liked that they didn't fill the pitcher with too much ice. ˜ Food was pretty good and the tapas portions were enough to be shared 2-4 ppl. ˜Very friendly staff."
5346,7,5,1,9/29/2014,"Such a fun place for dinner, especially Saturdays or Thursdays when they have flamenco dancers perform. The food comes out pretty quickly, the sangria is sweet, and the staff is super helpful and eager. Croquettes. Shrimp with garlic. Bread with tomato and manchego and jamon. All winners."
5347,7,5,1,9/26/2014,I had my birthday party here on a Saturday night. The manager that I arranged the party with was so helpful and very flexible. We had about 20 people- all you can eat small plates and unlimited sangria and it was one of the best deals in the city and such a great time. The flamenco show was just the icing on the cake. I have planned and been to many birthdays all over the city and this was one of the best experiences I have had- so easy and no stress involved! I would highly recommend this restaurant
5348,7,4,1,9/26/2014,Delicous food and friendly bartender. Came here on a whim on a Friday night and had a great time.
5349,7,5,1,9/26/2014,One of my favorite spots in nyc. The sangria is amazing and love the shrimp and meatballs!!
5350,7,5,1,9/24/2014,really good. must go
5351,7,4,1,9/23/2014,"It was great! I met my friend here for a catch up session. Low lighting so great for a date, but it was a little loud and hard to hear my friend. I love the spanish feel of the decor. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. The food came out quick and all of it was delicious. I would recommend the mussels, egg omelette and the skirt steak."
5352,7,5,1,9/21/2014,"Obsessed with this tapas place! Good food, live flamenco, fun times. Such a good place for a Friday night dinner with friends."
5353,7,3,1,9/20/2014,"This is a very nice place with a Flamenco dance show. I don't know the show is every day though. The food was OK, but not super nor memorable. We had a Paella and Octopus and it was pretty authentic! The drinks were pretty good as well. We had the sangria and although it was delicious we didn't order a second one because It was late already. The environment is really enjoyable. I may give it another try, especially if I'm in a ""flamenco"" mood."
5354,7,3,1,9/19/2014,"I'm giving 3 stars just because the tablao flamenco was GREAT; it shows they really enjoy what they do and that they are passionate dancers. No need for reservation thou, the place was half-empty. The food was OK; not exceptional. The sangria was good although a bit on the sweet side. Pulpo was overcooked."
5355,7,4,1,9/18/2014,"This was our second time to nai tapas. The last time we went there was a couple of years back. Both times for someone's bday and our experience has been awesome so far. The staff is great. Very welcoming and attentive. Our server both times was uno and he is very friendly and even offered to get us drinks on him because we were waiting for our table even after making reservations. Luckily we only waited for a few mins before we got our table. We went on a Thursday both times and they have live flamenco performance on Thursdays and sat nights which was just as good as what we remember last time. The food is fairly good. We ordered a bunch of small plates ranging from snail to chicken to shrimp to potatoes to goat cheese, all of which were pretty decent for our taste. We would go back not just because of the food but all of the other factors mentioned above!"
5356,7,5,1,9/15/2014,One of the best & most delicious tapas house in the city. The service is super and everything on the menu is decently priced. I highly recommend the mussels and skirt steak paired with mango sangria. If you come with a group. you'll be able to try a variety of tapas!
5357,7,5,1,9/12/2014,"This is my go to tapas place in the city. ˜The staff is super friendly, checks up on you, and makes thoughtful recommendations on the menu and drinks. ˜The food is great as well. ˜The tapas don't come out all at once, so you can take your time to savor each one. ˜For two people 5 tapas is enough food. ˜I recommend the empanada, ox tail, and fried goat cheese... yummy. ˜ If you can, try to get a reservation, this place does fill up during dinner hours."
5358,7,4,1,9/7/2014,"Delicious sangria. Happy hour runs until 7pm, which includes $20 pitchers of Sangria and $4 glasses. The place itself looks quite romantic yet casual. They offer a nice variation of tapas which average $7 for half serving or $14 full serving (average more or less)."
5359,7,4,1,9/5/2014,Typical east village vibe. Hanged out with friend over several tapas and glass of sangria. Variety of choices on the menu from ˜seafood to meat (and you might want to have every one of them!) My favorite is the braised ox tail with tropical sangria!
5360,7,4,1,9/3/2014,"Went here last Sunday night for tapas with some friends from out of town. It's a cute place. What we ordered: Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak), Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs w/ brandy sauce), assortment of cured meats & cheeses, grilled shrimp w/ garlic, and Patatas Alioli (potatoes in creamy garlic alioli). We enjoyed everything, but the potatoes in creamy garlic sauce & meatballs w/ brandy were my personal favorite. I could have eaten another whole order of the potatoes! To drink we had a pitcher of Blueberry pomegranate champagne Sangria and a pitcher of the Mango Sangria. The Blueberry pomegranate was AMAZING. Seriously hit the spot. Next time I come I would like to try some of the other small plates like the octopus, mussels, or croquettes, but overall the food & service was great."
5361,7,4,1,8/25/2014,"Now this place is all sorts of cute fun. We came here on a Saturday night for dinner and the last minute 10:30 Flamenco show. I have never even heard of the place or noticed it in the past even tho I've been to the bakery next door pretty often and in general, searching for eats within the area quite often as well. I wasn't sure what to expect, but my experience here is nothing but positive. Our server, Uno, was a hoot and made the experience that much more pleasurable. We ended up with 7 tapas plates between the two of us and it was more than filling. Bacalao, skirt steak, ham with fried goat cheese, mussels (a little on the puny side), and I can't remember as always what the rest was........ but for sure a place to check out"
5362,7,3,1,8/20/2014,"Went here with a friend for dinner. We ordered five things: 1) Octopus: so-so. They boil the octopus so it has a snot-like texture on the outside. Taste is alright but not the best preparation. 2) Chicken Croquettes: Good dish. Would order again. Would benefit from a sauce (they just give the croquettes by themselves). 3) Coconut Crepe: good dish but not accurately described on the menu. It's more of a seafood filled dumpling. Quite good. But not a crepe. 4) Mussels in wine sauce: quite good. Nice sauce and preparation. Good amount of mussels as well. 5) Salad. Besides white asparagus, the only vegetarian dish on the menu. I'm an avid meat eater. But seriously? Two vegetarian dishes on a menu of more than 30 items? Seems like laziness. Also getting the bill took ages. Overall okay meal. Wouldn't go back, but the meal was not bad."
5363,7,5,1,8/18/2014,"Great tapas, flamenco guitar n dancing show was fantastic. It's on the repeat list."
5364,7,1,1,8/17/2014,"Really disappointing food. We went here for tapas and flamenco on a Thursday and though the dancing was cool, I wouldn't waste your time here. A ton of fried and heavy food, even when it wasn't obvious on the menu. The seafood paella was disgusting with no flavor and what looked like instant Spanish rice (no joke). Chicken croquettes looked and tasted like something you'd buy from the freezer aisle of a grocery store. Everything tasted processed. The worst part? Even the sangria was gross. Their red sangria was all sugar and no alcohol. We went here since the Yelp reviews seemed promising and were sorely disappointed."
5365,7,5,1,8/12/2014,"Brought my parents here and had a great experience. The food was amazing, the staff was very nice, and the flamenco dancers added that extra spice. I highly recommend the Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos even though it is a little pricey for such small portions but the flavor is spot on. The empanadas were also amazing (so far, haven't had any bad empanadas in NYC). If you're drinking, try the sangrias (we got mango and it was to die for). This is a great little place in EV so I'd say groups of 4 or less are ideal. And make sure to make a reservation since they can get pretty packed."
5366,7,5,1,8/9/2014,"I went out with my wife and a family friend tonight. It was awesome, from the food to the setting. The bartender was great, and we had a great time."
5367,7,3,1,8/9/2014,"A disappointment. ˜Tapas were not all that authentic. ˜The gambas ajillo were unrecognizable from the ones I had in Spain. ˜The squid in ink was mediocre at best. ˜Sangria was respectable, but otherwise not recommended if you are looking for an authentic Spanish tapas experience."
5368,7,5,1,8/7/2014,"I am from Barcelona and this is my place to hang out when I feel homesick. The pulpo a la gallega and all the omelettes are awesome. It might be a little over price but on average in the city... I can't compare NY prices to Spanish ones, I guess. Service is the best. David, the manager, is very kind and nice as well as the bartenders. Stop by and enjoy the tapas and Estrella Damm beer!!!"
5369,7,3,1,7/29/2014,I have been to Nai a couple of times. ˜This time it was not so good. ˜In the past it was out friggin standing. I am not sure what happened. ˜The tapas did not have the same depth of flavor and spice they had in the past. I would not recommend this place to any of my friends unless I go back and get the tapas I had last year.
5370,7,2,1,7/25/2014,"Tried a range of tapas... Pan Tumaca, Churrasco Arriero, Croquetas De Jamon, Empanadillas De Carne, Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos.... they were ok, but nothing that I'm craving to have again. Red wine sangria was ok, not awesome."
5371,7,2,1,7/17/2014,Red sangria gets a solid rating for not being sweet and having great happy hour pricing ($5 for a large glass and pitcher special too). Servers were very friendly. Place was packed on a Monday night - good sign. Food was disappointing. Chorizo was overcooked and the chicken and ham croquetas were average. Patatas bravas were soggy instead of crispy/crunchy and the sauce was so spicy it over powered any other flavors. Go here to relax with some friends over sangria and get good service but not a real food destination.
5372,7,3,1,7/17/2014,"This place is sort of like it's hood: sloppy, sweet, cramped, a little sweaty, messy and fun. If you like sloppy, sweet, cramped, sweaty, messy and fun. It's also pretty cheap. I would wonder how they do it, but the quality is just not amazing , so I don't wonder, I just appreciate they don't overcharge for mediocre tapas. I've tried everything on the menu. I would like to say that something stands out, but that would be untrue. The chicken is good, chorizo ok, asparagus ok, patatas bravas, meh, tortilla espanola, ok. Sangria - white is better than read. We had a mango sangria that was pretty refreshing but overall the alcohol's sole purpose was to make the food taste better and ambiance less hectic. If you consider tortilla flats, great Mexican, then you will like Nai for Spanish food. It's meh, but sometimes a good imitation is sufficient."
5373,7,5,1,7/15/2014,"Great tapas, very reasonably priced. The garlic shrimp & chorizo w onions was among the best I've ever had. Seafood paella was great too but a bit on the fishy side. The skirt steak could be sliced a bit thinner. Overall very pleased with the food and service. Red sangria tops off a great experience."
5374,7,5,1,7/13/2014,"Amazing. ˜Sangrias, beer, tapas, service, atmosphere. ˜I even tried and enjoyed the sardines!"
5375,7,4,1,7/5/2014,"We stumbled across this place, and it was a wonderful delight. The food was delicious and the service was great and very friendy. Wonderful choice of wine. Definitely recommend it if you get a chance!"
5376,7,5,1,7/4/2014,"NAtive to the Iberian peninsula I appreciate great spanish cusine. This place takes me from nyc and leaves me feeling like I am in Sevilla for the night enjoying wonderful tapas and beautiful authentic flamenco show. The food, especially the octopus was delicious and cooked to the perfect consistency. Also the chorizo and oxtail were amazing. I have been here about 4 times and will continue being my go to spot for great Tapas."
5377,7,4,1,6/27/2014,"We had the patatas bravas, escargot, chorizo saut?ed in onlions and mussels in a spicy broth. Overall excellent food, great place for tapas. Cozy ambience. We had the red wine sangria and the pomegranate sangria. The drinks were great!"
5378,7,5,1,6/25/2014,"Nai Tapas Bar was an incredibly fun experience with authentic and delicious food. The sangria is amazing, and so was our waiter! I came here with 7 friends for a birthday dinner and would recommend it to anyone. Plus, Mon-Wed right now there is a $20 pitcher of sangria deal! Amazing place."
5379,7,4,1,6/15/2014,"This was the first restaurant my friend brought me to after landing in NY. There was only a bit of a wait when we ˜the food was delicious. Mostly all the tapas we got were delicious, with one or two tapas tasting okay. One thing you have to get: The Blueberry Pomegranate Champagne Sangria!! It's light and refreshing, and super delicious! I want to say it was worth it, but it was a little on the pricey end for tapas. However, I'm from California, where food is definitely cheaper, so the price may be ""normal"" for New York standards."
5380,7,1,1,6/13/2014,The tapas here were terrible. ˜The seafood croquettes were recommended by our waiter came out horrible and mushy and chewy. The octopus was boiled and tasted kinda rubbery. ˜The empanadas had a delicious meat filling but so much dough distracted from the whole dish. ˜I did like the fried goat cheese balls with ham over bread. Save your calories for a real tapas place. ˜The waiter was nice since I feel like he knew i wasn't too happy with the food.
5381,7,3,1,6/13/2014,"sangria variety was great, and food was good.. except for the octopus :) ˜I can't say it was memorable though..."
5382,7,5,1,6/13/2014,"First time trying tapas and definitely won't be my last, thanks to the great experience I had here! Service was excellent! The waiter was very helpful and offered recommendations. The people there were so nice. Food was delicious. We got the churrasco arriero (skirt steak), pulp a la gallega (octopus), caracoles (escargot), and pelotillas de queso de cabra (fried qoat cheese). Everything was delicious, got to try all different flavors! My favorite was the skirt steak; it was cooked very well and the dipping sauce was very tasty. Drinks are good too; we happen to come when it was happy hour. For $4, we got a big glass of sangria and it was really good with just enough alcohol! Not very expensive for good food! Definitely will come here again!"
5383,7,5,1,6/3/2014,"Absolutely love this place, hands down my favorite restaurant in the city (I promise I don't work here!). I discovered it randomly over 4 years ago (when I think it just opened), thank you Caracas for not being able to accommodate our party that night! All the food I've had is absolutely delicious. I always get gambas al ajillo (garlic shrimp), pulpo a la gallega (octopus), mussels, and potatoes and a variety of other stuff. I usually get the tapas portions of everything and split it with the rest of my table. I've been to Spain twice and the food here feels authentic. Still haven't tried the paella which must have gotten added to the menu sometime within the last year. Lastly, everything is very reasonably priced The sangria is awesome as well- delicious but not too sweet. The service is excellent and friendly. Don't miss their free flamenco shows on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8:30 and 10:30. The shows are awesome and run close to an hour. Make sure to make a reservation if you wanna see a show, I think around 2 weeks before to be safe. I made my last reservation 2 months in advance to make sure I can take my parents after graduation, but that was a bit excessive and I think the staff was a little shocked. Overall, feels like a little and delicious piece of Spain in the middle of the East Village. I've been here probably close to 10 times by now and I can't wait to go back!"
5384,7,4,1,5/31/2014,"This place is pretty legit. As far as tapas go it's pretty solid, granted I don't eat pork or seafood so in prob missing their best dishes, but what I did have was pretty good. Although the Patatas Bravas and Asparagus were not as good as I had hoped, in fact they were kinda bad. The chicken croquets and Empanadas were on point. It's a good place for a crowd, it's very noisy though so a get to know you date may be better suited elsewhere. The good thing about this place is that it's true Tapas. Everything is small and about 5 bucks so you can order about 5 dishes and share them!"
5385,7,1,1,5/31/2014,"Absolute worst restaurant in manhattan. Terrible staff, terrible food, terrible time. I would recommend it only to my worst enemy."
5386,7,4,1,5/28/2014,"Good tapas place. Can be a little loud but otherwise good date place. Recommended: Croquetas De Pollo, patatas bravas"
5387,7,5,1,5/26/2014,"Remarkable, spot-on tapas served by gracious, helpful staff. In my many outings to Nai, I've yet to be disappointed by any dish. Most notable are the galician boiled octopus and the paella, which often sells out given its popularity/ ridiculous level of deliciousness. However, Nai stands out among its East Village competitors due its superior pacing. If you order red sangria, your meat dishes will arrive first. White? The seafood is brought promptly to the table. They sell an awesome, sweet seafood crepe that makes for a perfect savory dessert, which conveniently arrives right at the end of the meal. Small restaurants in New York are often driven to maximize covers, rushing their diners through disorganized meals. Nai's consistent attention to detail and order makes it a real gem. Wait for a table, you won't be sorry."
5388,7,4,1,5/23/2014,"If you're a fan of great food in a cozy environment with amazing Flamenco performances, you must check this place out. There were not that many vegetarian options but dishes we ordered were all excellent, except for one. What we ordered: Patata Bravas - Nice spicy kick in the sauce Patata Aoli(?) - My second favorite dish that had garlic aoli on top of square potatoe fries Coconut seafood crepe - My favorite dish that had shrimp and crab inside small dumpling looking crepes Goat cheese Croquette - Small portions. We only got 3 small croquettes... Mango Sangria- Definitely worth it. For $7 you get a huge glass of tangy, perfect sangria. White Asparagus with pink sauce - Unlike what other reviewers said, this dish did not work for me or my friends. It was mushy and just plain not appetizing. However, the waiter was so kind to take it off of our bill when we asked."
5389,7,5,1,5/19/2014,"I was visiting from out-of-town with my gf and we found Nai. We had to wait a good hour for a seat at the bar, but the sangria was really really good and put me at ease making the wait no problem. We shared pulpo en su tinta, pulpo gallega, a Spanish Omelette and jamon y queso. I especially enjoyed the pulpo en su tinta, but my gf didn't. She gagged just looking at me enjoying eating the octopus smiling w the ink sauce from it all over my mouth. ˜Maybe it's because I spent several months in Spain that I was unfazed by the presentation of pulpo en su tinta. My plan is to bring my dad there when we go on a business trip to NY in June."
5390,7,4,1,5/17/2014,"Came in on a Saturday night so we could catch the flamenco show. Ordered a couple of their tapas and some wine, oh my it was delicious! Everything we tried was cooked perfectly and well seasoned. What stood out the most were the ""gambas al ajillo"" and the ""pulpo"". You can taste the difference and the authentic flair compared to other tapas places. We were seated right in front of the performers and it was delightful to enjoy our food to flamenco dance. Definitely coming back! ˜warning: this place is packed on the weekends, get a reservation if possible."
5391,7,4,1,5/14/2014,"I went there twice. The first time I was very impressed with the tapas, the sangria and the music (some Manu Chao, Jarabe de Palo, Julieta Venegas). Very tasty and quick service. The 2nd time, I went with the same enthusiasm but, despite it being a weeknight again, the staff seemed too busy/overwhelmed to even talk to us. The 1st person asked us what we want, we said we want a table, he told us to wait. 5 minutes later we hadn't heard from anyone. I asked another person, she said she'll check to see if there's something and came back 1-2 minutes later saying there's only place at the bar. Not sure why this was, there seemed to be some empty tables (maybe they had an event to prepare for, not sure) but we were hungry and left. I'll definitely go again, but did have a bit of mixed reaction."
5392,7,5,1,5/11/2014,The food is great here. So are the Sangria's . The service was well and I loved the entertainment. It would be best to make reservations.
5393,7,5,1,5/11/2014,Good place!! Small so make reservations. We ended up eating at bar because even with a reservation it was a long wait. Yum tapas good drinks and if your lucky some entertainment.
5394,7,4,1,5/11/2014,"Really good sangria. Food was tasty, and lots of good options! There were still more items on the menu that we wanted to try.... More filling for your buck than most tapas places. Would like to return for the dancing!"
5395,7,5,1,5/8/2014,"Obsessed with the place!!! ˜Wait is always long but the food is delicious and the manager/owner is so nice that you rarely care about the wait. ˜Love the food - literally have had one of almost everything on the menu and am never disappointed! ˜Sangria and prices are excellent too! Highly recommend for a girls night out, date night, when family is in town, etc -- have never brought anyone who didn't immediately love it!"
5396,7,5,1,5/8/2014,"Starting from the way you are greeted at the bar (thanks Dave!), every person who came in contact with us was polite, helpful and gave great suggestions. ˜We went here for our 2nd anniversary, and it was a perfect night. Especially suggest trying the ham croquetas (or any croquetas for that matter), and the garlic shrimp. ˜The coconut crepe with scallops, crab and shrimp was also delicious, and the fried goat cheese never disappoints. Beyond the food, they also had a great beer and wine list, which was very affordable ($9 - 11 glasses of wine). ˜I must mention the staff one more time, because everyone made us feel very welcome and felt truly sincere. We definitely plan on returning here without a doubt, since there were a few dishes and the sangria that we still want to try. ˜Don't forget to pick up an Italian pastry next door on your way home too. Enjoy!"
5397,7,5,1,5/5/2014,"One of favorite restaurants in nyc, though only on Thursday and Saturdays because of the live flamenco music. With this as a complement to the tapas served here, you're really in for a perfect evening. I've been here several times and have never been disappointed. The tapas they serve here are great and the paella is pretty good as well. Notables include the Gambas, patatas bravas, croquetas, any dish with sardines and the chorizo. The paella was pretty good in addition to the house bread which you definitely need to dip in your Gambas oil. The only bad criticism I have was that the sangria could've been a lot better as it tasted bland and watered down. Otherwise great restaurant for any occasion !"
5398,7,3,1,5/5/2014,My husband and I were looking for a good Tapas place and found this one on a Yelp. Unfortunately it did not I've up to the favorable reviews - food was just fair and service was slow.
5399,7,5,1,5/5/2014,"A group of 6 of us went to Nai for my brothers birthday party. Wow! What a fantastic time. The foot was superb, the waitstaff was on point, and the flamenco was fantastic (just like I remember it in Spain)! Since it was my brothers birthday they invited him up on stage to dance. It was a great night that we will always remember. Thank you to all the staff and dancers for an unforgettable evening!"
5400,7,3,1,5/1/2014,"i'm disappointed in this restaurant because while the food was good, i felt there were many technical and conceptual errors that if tightened up, could have made it great. none of the bread was toasted. ˜i don't know if that was intentional, but i really felt the cold, slightly stale bread took away from the meal. ˜the one tapas we got with toasted bread really paired well with the curizo, so i'm disappointed all of the bread wasn't toasted. ˜ the sauce on the asparagus was just a misfire to me. ˜i'm sure it's made from scratch, but it literally tasted exactly like thousand island dressing and did not pair well with the asparagus. the tortilla was somewhat underwhelming and bland. ˜the paella was border line inedible salty. ˜i don't even necessarily blame them for that. ˜it happens. but just another example of careless errors. the grilled sardines were solid, but again, wish it came on toasted bread. ˜the Patatas Bravas were another solid dish. ˜the sauce on that was crack. ˜we got one tapas with fried cheese and that was great. the meat/cheese platter was underwhelming. ˜felt like i was at a suburban dinner party and someone just opened up a meat/cheese packet from plastic. all in all, i didn't dislike this restaurant, i was just disappointed by it. there were a few great bits, a few terrible bits, but mostly it was just solid, unexciting food. ˜i would not come back here again."
5401,7,3,1,5/1/2014,"Came here this past weekend for a friends birthday, awesome food, weak but yummy sangria, and a pretty rude waiter. First off, the food. We got so much I'm not even sure of everything we had. Stand outs include the coconut crepes, the skirt steak, and the meatballs. You can just order as you go so be careful, it does start to add up! One of the ˜things they pride themselves on is their sangria selection, we ended up getting the pomegranate blueberry champagne sangria, the mango sangria, and the red sangria, all of which were delicious but the red was the only one with any kind of kick to it. I don't know about you but when I drink through 6 glasses of sangria I expect to feel some kind of buzz after. Lastly our waiter was super ""pleasant rude."" He wasn't outright rude but he did have a bit of an attitude with us and tended to be super disapproving when we didn't take his recommendations. Not a big deal but a bit annoying. Go for the food and go for the flamenco, they have live dancing on weekends!"
5402,7,4,1,4/29/2014,"This was a great evening had by all!!! ˜First of all you must make a reservation if you want to see the flamingo dancers on Thursday or Saturday evening. The d?cor is rustic but clean and looks very authentic, with small wood tables, a large wooden bar and other old world wood items to make it feel like an old wine cellar...I like it!! I went with a group of six and we tried several plates, and all of them were very tasty. ˜I was pleased to see that they make small plates and large plates of each item. ˜If you're with a large group get the larger plates it a much better deal and you can go back for seconds All I will say is get a pitcher of SANGRIA....don't short change yourself on the experience!!!!! Now the best part of all was a mini Flamingo dance show....I was totally surprised and thoroughly entertained!!! Two female dancers & 2 musicians turned everyone up and brought them to their feet. ˜It was an awesome job so much so I want to buy the unattractive shoes and learn how to flaming dance A+ for this place I will ˜be back....DEELISH!!!!!"
5403,7,5,1,4/29/2014,"I've been going to nai tapas for at least the past 2 years. It's my go to tapas and sangria place. Their happy hour for pitchers of sangria run till 7pm. The tapas, omg the tapas are sooo good. My favorites are ˜ Croquetas De Jamon, Patatas Bravas,Gambas Al Ajillo, Pulpo A La Gallega, Croquetas De Bacalao, squid in its own ink and the meatballs are sooo good. Every time I go there, I leave there satisfied. The waiters are so friendly and arent afraid to joke around with their customers."
5404,7,4,1,4/25/2014,it was great
5405,7,5,1,4/21/2014,"Go for the octopus, stay for the flamenco music, stay even longer for the house sangria. I dined with ten others, and the service didn't miss a beat. Far better than the surrounding tapas options. Head in either early or very late, this place is packed from 7:30 - 10."
5406,7,5,1,4/20/2014,"Came here for a friend's birthday. We ordered like half the menu and everything tasted so amazing! The tapas that really stood out for me was the Patatas Bravas - their house special sauce brings liiiifeee to mee, potatoes are perfectly made Croquetas De Pollo - warm cheesy goodness, i actually couldnt tell there was chicken in here, but the mixture of melted cheese was soooo good. also had the Croquetas De Jamon which was less cheesy and more ham, also great. Seafood paella - perfectly seasoned, not overly salty, so much flavor, rice is cooked to PERFECTION, seafood not overcooked. One of the better ones I tried. Empanadillas De Carne - loooved the beef filling, loved the outer flaky shell even more. Besides the food, we also tried 4 pitchers of their house sangria. My favorite was the mango sangria. Afterwards, they had flamenco dancing performance. Their band and the dancers were amazinggggg. We felt like we took a trip to Spain for dinner. ˜Very great ambience. Waiter was very friendly and kept checking with us for more drinks and food. Would definitely come back, be sure to make reservations!"
5407,7,5,1,4/20/2014,Heard about this place from a friend. Boy was I glad that I did. Was easily able to reserve a table for 2 @ 10pm on a Thursday. Just in time for the flamenco dancers. Loved the decor. Had the champaign sangria was delicious. You'll wanna get the full pitcher. We had ordered 4 dishes to share. Steak was delicious and also had goat cheese. Any plate that passed looked great! Waite staff friendly and always kept my glass full. I will return
5408,7,5,1,4/19/2014,"This place is definitely worth trying out! Visited this place to celebrate my friend's birthday, our waitress was very friendly and attentive, our food was great. We mainly tried the vegetarian options and ordered pitchers of Sangria. This seems like a fun place to catch up with friends and relax after work!"
5409,7,3,1,4/15/2014,"Food was ok...some plates were better than others... If you're in the area then ok to stop by, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. Churrasco Arriero skirt steak saut?ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers- good flavor but overcooked...meat was too chewy Albondiguillas Estofadas stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce...meatballs too mushy and sauce was too sweet, not one of my favorite dishes Gambas En Salsa Verde grilled shrimp in parsley, wine & garlic sauce- tasty but nothing to write home about"
5410,7,4,1,4/9/2014,"Good service, great tapas. My wife and I ordered about 5 dishes, which were enough for both of us to share. We went during happy hour so our drinks were cheap"
5411,7,4,1,4/7/2014,"This is a great place to eat. Large selection of tapas and sangria. We split four tapas between two people and that was plenty. The mussels and garlic shrimp were both dynamite. Definitely recommended, and there are plenty of good spots nearby for pre/post dinner drinks."
5412,7,5,1,4/6/2014,Wonderful place! Friendly service! Came when it was $20 pitchers of Sangria. The food is delicious-especially the fried goat cheese. The mussels are also delicious...and the blueberry champagne sangria is absolutely to die for!
5413,7,4,1,4/5/2014,"Great service, attentive but not over the top. Food was terrific. Escargot, blood sausages, cured meat platter with cheeses were fresh and delicious. The garlic shrimp, seafood croquettes had heaps of flavor. Seating was comfortable, wife and I had a blast. Sangria has love in it :) So does this charming place. We'll be back."
5414,7,5,1,4/5/2014,"great food, awesome vibe and I would suggest making a reservation so that you don't have to wait."
5415,7,5,1,4/1/2014,"I just figured I would update a year later. I have returned to Nai with my brother for several birthdays and other various celebrations and we are always amazed with the fantastic food and service, keep up the amazing job. Also you MUST try their house sangria (I'm partial to the white) especially if you enjoy a sweeter sangria."
5416,7,5,1,3/28/2014,"Had a wonderful birthday dinner here! We came on a Thursday, so were able to enjoy the Flamenco dancing. ˜For a few minutes we forgot we were in NYC and were transported to a small restaurant in Seville. ˜ The tapas are all very fresh and come out nice and hot. ˜The sangria is a little on the sweet side, but delicious nonetheless. Highly recommend!"
5417,7,4,1,3/26/2014,"Great food and a really nice staff. ˜The hanger steak, shrimp in garlic sauce, and fried goat cheese dishes were incredible. ˜Try the squid cooked in its own ink if you're feeling adventurous - it's pretty fishy, but a cool experience. ˜ Their sangria pitchers can be a little pricey relative to other places nearby, but they do have half-price pitchers some night of the week. ˜Also, the menu can be a little overwhelming because it lacks organization."
5418,7,3,1,3/24/2014,"I can only comment on the food, since I don't really drink, but the sangria choices sound amazing! BF brought me here for my birthday the other night. Despite the cruddy weather, the atmosphere at Nai was lively and upbeat. We got a table towards the back. The server was really friendly and answered whatever questions we had about the menu items. I think between 2 people about 5-6 tapas plates is good, depending on how big of an appetite you have. We had: + Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak (fabulous!) + Gambas Al Ajillo - garlic shrimp (make sure you have bread for dipping!) + Caracoles - escargot (also good for dipping bread) + Empanadillas De Carne - beef empanadas (very filling) + Croquetas De Jam›n - serrano ham croquettes (better than the chicken one since there's a bit more saltiness that brings out more of the flavors) + Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Overall I would recommend it for a nice evening out with friends for socializing over small bites and sangria."
5419,7,3,1,3/23/2014,"This is place should have an overall 3 or 3.5. I just think 4 is a but too generous. Made a reservation for 2 and still waited 45 minutes... they did make up for it by giving us a pitcher of complimentary sangria, but it came when the check came and we were ready to start the night out...so we didn't drink much of it anyway. Food was OK, not amazing... had the octopus, garlic shrimp, and pickled tuna. None were amazing, a lot of butter in all the dishes. I have had better tapas and I probably wouldn't return nice we live in the city of thousands of restaurants, but always glad to give new places a try!"
5420,7,5,1,3/18/2014,"I wandered into Nai several years ago for the first time. I have been there now a total Of 5 times. Service is always friendly, if a little frazzled. Wine choices favor Spanish ( no surprise). This and sangria makes me happy. But the piece de resistance is the live flamenco on Thurs an Sat. Book at least a week ahead, they have become super popular. Again, no surprise. Food is a volition pricey for portion size, but always fresh and tasty."
5421,7,5,1,3/18/2014,Great food - Great server - Reasonable prices...this place has it all! Definitely will go back!!
5422,7,4,1,3/17/2014,"Went with 4 girlfriends on a Friday and there was a great crowd. ˜We split 4 tapas and a pitcher of sangria and ended up only spending $20 each . ˜That is a steal for NY. ˜We had the mussels, skirt steak, patatas with garlic aioli, and fried goat cheese. ˜Everything was really great. I probably would skip the goat cheese next time though. ˜The portions are big too. None of us left hungry. ˜I will definitely go here again and try to make the flamenco show. ˜I recommend making a reservation."
5423,7,5,1,3/16/2014,"Boyfriend and I just went here and it was amazing! Cozy rustic atmosphere with brick walls. Low lighting and not overly decorated We got the pomegranate and blueberry sangria. Delicious And a bunch of tapas. We got... Shrimp in garlic sauce, meat and mixed cheese platter, ham croquettes, spicy tomato sauce potatos, fried goat cheese, meatballs, and the coconut crepes. All were absolutely amazing! Our least fav was probably the meatballs but it was simply bc they werent AS awesome as everything else Reasonably priced as well. Super friendly service. Our waiters name was Uno and he was amazing!!!! Recommended dishes. Answered questions and was attentive but not overbearing Will be going back. Next time on a flamenco night"
5424,7,5,1,3/8/2014,Excellent portions. Delicious taste and reasonable pricing ! Fabulous tapas and very tasty sangria. The flamenco nights are out of this world !!
5425,7,4,1,3/6/2014,"Spectacular selection of Wines and freshly made Sangria per Monday through Wednesday Happy Hour Special. The Decor was very indicative of a Spanish Taverna in Anadalucia. The Gambas Al Ajillo and Calimar in its own ink were flavorful and delicious. I was not overly impressed by the Jamon, but overall a step up from the normal overpriced sensationalized Tapas restaurants indicative of Manhattan. Good Tapas involves simplicity and good company."
5426,7,4,1,3/5/2014,"Very charming place, lots of good choices of Sangria, must haves are the Garlic Shrimp (save some bread to soak up that sauce) and Chorizo dishes."
5427,7,5,1,3/4/2014,"I love everything about Nai Tapas!! It's a great place for groups/birthday parties... I've been four or five times with a party of 5+ and everyone always has a great time. The food is delicious (get the garlic shrimp and dip the bread in the sauce!) but not too expensive, the sangria is great and the service is good too! I've seen the flamenco show twice and it's really fun -- both times we were sitting right in front and it was pretty loud, so don't plan on having any deep conversations during it (lasts about 30-45 mins i think?)."
5428,7,5,1,3/2/2014,"Nai Tapas is awesome!! Amazing food, great service, centrally located in E. Village and perfect for large groups. Came here last night for one of my besties' birthday. We were a group of 10, and so when my friend made the reservation, the restaurant suggested a fixed menu of $40/ person for dinner and unlimited pitchers of sangria. What more could you ask for at $40?! Great price point. This place is pretty casual for a tapas bar - not overly romantic or fancy by any means; but the food is authentic, the crowd is low-key and even if you weren't from E. Village, you easily could feel like a local here. The food was AH-mazing. Cannot get over it. We were all stuffed to the brim yet continued eating because we just couldn't stop ourselves. Here are the dishes that were brought out to us from the menu - 2 portions of each plate were served for the group (plus baskets of bread): - Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce): ***my favorite dish*** - Bacalao Frito (lightly fried fresh cod): the fish was as soft as butter and the dipping sauce was tasty - Croquetas de Pollo (chicken croquettes) & Croquetas de Jamon (Serrano ham): both so good! - Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omelette): probably my least fave of all as the flavor was very mild - Patatas Bravas (potatoes coated with spicy house tomato sauce): tasty but very spicy! - Patatas Alioli (potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce): bomb.com! - Charrasco Arriero (skirt steak): awesome dish; meat was very tender - Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs in brandy sauce) - Chorizo a la Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage): very tasty Wow. We ate a LOT!! My fave was definitely the shrimp & the croquettas. Least fave: the tortilla espanola (though it was good, there were other potato-based dishes already served that this felt excessive). The sangria pitchers kept on coming and being refilled! ** Dessert time (though honestly, who has room for more food at this point?!): The birthday girl and one other from our group is gluten-intolerant, so we brought our own cake for dessert. The servers were helpful by bringing out the cake with a candle and then they cut up the cake for us. We didnt stay for the live flamenco dancing, as we were on our way to sing some karaoke down the street at Planet Rose, but towards the last hour of dinner, there was a small band playing live flamenco / salsa music and it was a fun atmosphere. We will all definitely be back! Service was excellent. Can't wait to try more dishes from the menu. I had never heard of this hidden gem before but am so glad it was introduced to me."
5429,7,1,1,2/28/2014,I don't understand how this place can get so many 4-5 star reviews. The food here is less than average especially for tapas in NYC. I ˜did not think the sangria was good and the decor was nothing special. The service also did not impress me. I will definitely not be returning here.
5430,7,4,1,2/26/2014,"word of advice if you want close seats near the flamenco show make reservations a week in advance if you want really good seats in front of the flamenco show make reservations two weeks in advance. I found this out, after the fact I made reservations two days before the flamenco show, even after the guy told me ""you will not be sitting near the flamenco show if that is okay?"", I said yes in hopes of sneaking up to the front during the flamenco show to catch a glimpse of the dance.... boy was I wrong, this place is pretty small and the stage for the flamenco dancers are even smaller. When I went up to try to get a glimpse of the show, I was blocking the people sitting at the bar and the waiters/waitresses hustling and bustling by. ˜One waiter finally said ""you have to move, you are blocking everybody."" Whoops... anyway flamenco show aside (which was pretty awesome for the few seconds I caught of it) ˜food was pretty decent. I got the blueberry champagne sangria that everyone raves about it, and it is delicious- all bubbly and fruity and deceptively strong. One of these bad boys will definitely get you a little tipsy. For the tapas my friend and I shared the: 1) Plates of cheese and cured meats- I loved the manchego cheese- so soft and delish and the meats were good too 2) The fried goat cheese- all fried and tangy and once you bite into it, the cheese just oozes right out. 3) The garlic shrimp-- the sauce is thick and garlicky and great paired with bread 4) The clams diavalo -- the dish actually came out kinda cold, the sauce was really spicy and good but ˜I wasn't a huge fan. 5) The chorizo with quail egg - presentation is so cute with the tiny little egg on top and it was quit tasty but I feel like it's better off without the bread on the bottom and just chorizo and egg. I kinda wish I had more chorizo in the dish too. Overall the food was great and our waiter (Uno) ˜was amazing. Would love to return to try other tapas and hopefully score some good seats"
5431,7,4,1,2/24/2014,"Worth all of the hype! I visited Barcelona, Monsant, Rioja and Madrid this past December and have been craving tapas, Spanish charcuterie and cheeses ever since. I can be particular about food and am always skeptical about places in NYC- I'm always of the opinion that most restaurants survive even if they are mediocre simply because there are so many people in this darn city that they inevitably will have a full house even if their food/service isn't great. Well this is a serious neighborhood spot, hidden gem, worth all of the positive reviews! Service was welcoming and polite, if you have a little wait just grab a drink from the bartender, they will transfer your tab. The atmosphere is cozy and can be great for a romantic date night or a group birthday. They have a tv at the bar if you care for that- I think they were playing some futbol game, and they play Spanish pop music (Juanes, Bebe etc) softly, enough to be enjoyable but not too loud to be obnoxious. It is definitely worth making a reservation (OpenTable) as this place is very popular for date night, groups (3+ people all the way to 15+ birthday outings). Even if your table isn't ready right away, the host/hostess will get you seated and if the wait is too long they'll even bring by complimentary Sangria. Now for the food! Tortilla Espa?ola was excellent and good-sized (we had leftovers that we gladly took home for breakfast), Albondigas (great , slow-simmered sauce), Gambas Al Ajillo ˜(Shrimp in Garlic Sauce- you could just order two orders of this and a basket of bread and call it a day!), Grilled Sardines with Red Pepper on Toast- fresh, grilled perfectly!; and Pan Tumaca (toast with tomato, manchego, Jamon Serrano). Everything was fresh, authentic and tasted very similar to tapas I have had in Spain. The only thing I wasn't thrilled with was the Pulpo with Smoked Pimenton (octopus with Spanish Paprika). It was obviously the kind from a can- which in a pinch if you're craving it, can be ok- and the texture was unappetizing. If you are the type that likes authentic grilled, fresh Octopus (such as the type they serve in Greek/Mediterranean restaurants or other Spanish places; Pulpo a la Plancha), this is not it. This is the kind from a can, warmed up, tossed with olive oil and smoked paprika. Wasn't a fan. In addition, they were out of the Jamon croquetas which was disappointing, since that should be a staple item, but it was a busy Friday night. We had wines by the glass and a half pitcher of Sangria. The Sangria was ok but I am a wine purist and don't like wine/liquor punches or mimosas, but my friend enjoyed it. All in all, if you are prepared for a cozy, neighborhood spot that is popular, make a reservation and GO! There were two large groups, at least 10 people, at the same time we were there, and the waitstaff was able to serve them as well as the regular tables with no problem. They work hard and seem to enjoy their jobs, we always had water refills, etc, no problem asking for extra bread or an extra fork. Definitely recommend!"
5432,7,5,1,2/22/2014,"Such a beautiful place! I came here to celebrate valentine's day and it was just perfect! The locations narrow space can be a bit claustrophobic making it my only drawback abt this place. There is no easy way to maneuver through ppl. You have to move out of the way and be cautious not to bump someone else while doing so. With all this said I highly recommend making reservations to avoid this awkward dance with ppl. Plus who wants to wait more than 15mins for a table to become available?! Ok, first the drinks! I had a regular glass of sangria for $7. Not only was it delicious but it was huge!!! My dilemma was whether to order the half pitcher or a glass. The glass all the way! It was strong, and delicious. ˜By not ordering the half pitcher you can also try the diff sangria flavors, like i did. (I had the tropical sangria it was fruity but I def prefer the regular sangria). Just keep in mind 1 glass is sufficient but who can deny wanting to try as many flavors?! The food!! Yum yum yum! My absolute favorite were the meatballs and the empanadas. The pollo al ajillo was mmmmmm so good. The mussels were ok. This food reminded me of my moms cooking! How could I not give this place 5 stars? With those four plates it was enough for two ppl. They also constantly refill our bread basket which is nice bc you are able to use it to taste the sauce from the meatballs, chicken etc. The flamenco show which was suppose to start at 8:30 was just a cherry on top to the dinner. Unfortunately, there was a bday going on so they slightly blocked the stage but we were still able to enjoy the performance and music during our meal. They even invited the bday girl on stage!! For me this place is def on my list for bday considerations!!!"
5433,7,3,1,2/18/2014,"Met up with a girlfriend to catch up, we hadn't seen each other in, well, let's say, way too long. I'm giving this spot 3-stars not based on food, but only because it was chill, we sat for hours and were unrushed and the service was pretty good. ˜We shared tapas which were just so-so and unfortunately don't warrant a return visit. However, if you need a place for tapas, pretty good service in a relaxed atmosphere in East Village this might be a good spot for you."
5434,7,5,1,2/17/2014,"I came here on a Thursday night to enjoy some drinks and a Flamenco show. ˜Warning: ˜This review is NOT about food. We ordered a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria and it was amazing. ˜If only all sangrias could be this good...It had the perfect balance of sweetness, bubbles, and kick from the alcohol, leaving you with the best kind of happy buzz. ˜The flamenco show was unreal. ˜You could see the passion in the performers' faces, this includes the dancers and the musicians. ˜I remember half way though the show thinking how thankful I am to live in Manhattan because without leaving the city, I could feel like I teleported to Spain for a few hours. ˜You get so sucked into the show that you forget you're in New York! If you want an authentic, intimate experience, this is your spot."
5435,7,5,1,2/14/2014,"Made the reservation online for Wednesday 2/13 as it was my boyfriends birthday. After careful research on yelp i made the reservation for 8:00pm. Arrived at 745' ish. We were seated they knew exactly who we were. (on the reservation i noted it was his birthday and when they called me to confirm the reservation i mentioned if we can perhaps have a flan sent to the table.) they were amazing. The food! We had: The garlic shrimp - amazing! oh my! it was delicious! the skirt steak - amazing as well! the paella - my boyfriend loved it (i thought it was okay) the meatballs - not our favorite the goat cheese balls - ˜ i loved them amazingly crunchy and soft on the inside. (the mister has never had goat cheese and fell in love) the snails - great experience so you can say you have tasted them but ive had better. coconut flan - i was too stuffed to eat it the mister ate it all (and he is not a big fan of coconut... ) I had the red sangria and he had the mango 2 glasses. :) since it was his birthday he got asked to join the flamenco show. It was amazing! We had a blast! he had ˜blast, enjoyed the food, enjoyed the show, enjoyed the service. Will i go back again? ummm YES! we are already talking about what we will have. Must go, must experience!"
5436,7,4,1,2/11/2014,"I celebrated my birthday here on a Saturday night, which is one of their flamenco performance nights. I got a great view of the stage and was blown away by the dancers! Definitely make a dinner reservation around a show time. It's worth it. In terms of food and drinks, there are a variety of sangria choices and all the tapas we ordered were pretty good. There were so many tapas options it was almost overwhelming, in a good way. The service was great! Jenny, our server, was incredibly welcoming and attentive. I had a great night!"
5437,7,5,1,2/9/2014,"Can't beat east village for food, and this place proves that. A very authentic Spanish restaurant with all the tapas I'd had in Madrid, and done well. There was flamenco dancing sat night, which made for great entertainment. This is place is wonderful for dates and chats with close friends. There are just good vibes there, just a great place."
5438,7,5,1,2/8/2014,"Upon the recommendation of a regular, I met up with friends at Nai Tapas and was totally blown away by the awesomeness of this place! It's not huge, so definitely get there before 7pm unless you have made a reservation. There are a number of specialty sangrias, which you can purchase by the glass, the half pitcher, or a full pitcher. Consider them! All the tapas come in large and small sizes, so I recommend ordering about 6-7 (for a party of 3) of the small sizes, especially the: Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak saut?ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers Albondiguillas Estofadas - stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce Gambas Al Ajillo - grilled shrimp in garlic sauce Almejas En Salsa Verde - clams in parsley, wine and garlic sauce I loved all four of these dishes!! I also tried the new oxtail item on the menu, but realized oxtail just isn't for me. I am glad I tried it though. Service is outstanding and friendly, and I understand there are flamenco dancers some nights. I cannot wait to go back, possibly with my Book Club or a date!"
5439,7,5,1,2/4/2014,"Food was amazing! ordered oxtail, beef empanadas, and so much more. We had a party of 5 and with at least 4 cocktails the bills was under $200. In addition to the flamenco show, this place is a gem! Celebrated my birthday and I would take a star away because they had all the people who were celebrating their birthdays there get up and dance but I had so much fun it didn't matter. Definitely go there but make a reservation. This place fills up quick and runs out of room on the nights they have the flamenco show."
5440,7,5,1,1/26/2014,"LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. ˜We've spent lots of time in Spain and this is just as good as being in a local Spanish bar! ˜The food is amazing, the service is great, the atmosphere is fabulous especially the weekend evenings when they have music and dancing (I'm not sure of the schedule, but when you catch it it's great). ˜They also have my favorite spanish drink, Tinto de Verano."
5441,7,3,1,1/21/2014,"Update: unfortunately their food was not as nice as before...but they still have nice stuff, live flamenco and good atmosphere. Would I go back? I don't think so."
5442,7,5,1,1/20/2014,"The first time I came here I ordered the oxtail. Something the bf never had before. I had to put him on. It was an amazing experience and I was happy to share it with him. I can definitely consider this my new go-to tapas spot. The food seemed to have some thought put into it and quite ethnic. Lots of variety and the servers are very nice. Try to get the high-seated tables, it seems to carry the ambience well, instead of the low seating section tucked away in the back."
5443,7,4,1,1/13/2014,"What a wonderful place! ˜Cozy, comfortable and low-key, this tapas bar has it all. ˜The staff is attentive and actually happy to be there! ˜The food is delicious: from the chorizo on toast topped with quail egg, to the stuffed peppers, to the skirt steak to the Seafood Payaya (their way) everything exceeded expectation. ˜ I can not wait to go back!"
5444,7,5,1,1/10/2014,"Fun Thursday night! Came around 8pm for my boyfriend's birthday and were treated to a live flamenco show. Food was delicious and the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was amazing. I had called ahead to see if they could bring out a dessert for the birthday celebration. INSTEAD, my boyfriend and I were both surprised when the live band called his name over the mic to have a birthday dance with one of the flamenco dancers. Definitely recommend for a fun date night."
5445,7,5,1,1/6/2014,"One of the best tapas places in NY! Food was amazing and all people working there are super friendly. My group went for my friend's birthday Saturday night. The Flamenco dance every Saturday made the night a lot more fun and engaging. They served us a slice of birthday cake for free and ""allowed"" my bday friend to dance in front of everyone. Will definitely come back."
5446,7,5,1,1/6/2014,"If you live in or are visiting NYC: COME HERE! Make a reservation for Thursday or Saturday at 8:00 or 10:00. And prepare yourself for a fantastically free flamenco show!! It was amazing and thoroughly entertaining, they even make people who are celebrating their birthdays get up and stomp away! I would strongly suggest bringing a friend so you can try more of the amazing menu. But if you're solo like me request a seat at the bar so you can watch the flurry of sangrias and possibly make friends with the bartender or people sitting next to you. This is also a great date spot if you're looking to romance someone over passionate dancing and tasty nibbles."
5447,7,4,1,1/5/2014,"We went there for a quiet dinner on New Year Eve. We made a reservation the day before. We got a nice seat by the window. The server was very polite. The food was pretty good. We LOVE the ox tail dish very much. It is a MUST to order! We had a few other small plates they were all very delicious. They came in a generous size and reasonably priced. The spicy potatoes is another one to try. We had a few other variations before, this one is pretty good. We also had the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. it was delicious. We will definitely go back!"
5448,7,5,1,1/3/2014,"Tasty tapas with complex flavor. Maybe better then Spain, just sayin"
5449,7,5,1,1/2/2014,"I need to come back here ASAP. My friends and I came without reservations on New Years Eve around 9pm (although I tried to make a reservation online, but as expected on NYE, no luck). We were greeted by David, who was so incredibly nice and hilarious! He said he wasn't sure if there were any openings, but spent several minutes to check (I guess to analyze the restaurant crowd and to see if anyone was leaving). He came back, said the wait was 5 minutes, which was fantastic since I expected to be turned away! We weren't staying for the whole night when he asked us, and when we fervently assured him we weren't, he enthusiastically asked us ""why not? you should!"" ... which was another response I wasn't expecting (I thought he was going to say 'good, because we're booked and you've only got the table until the next party comes' or 'we're booked for the rest of the night' or 'you can't have the table forever'). I believe my waitress was named Jenny, who is also just as charming and helpful. Food was delicious! I had to get the seafood paella, my friends got this delicious fruity salad and some other things I cannot recall... we stayed a good amount of time before leaving to our New Years Eve engagements, sad to leave this great find. But I'll definitely be back (next time to enjoy the drinks)!!"
5450,7,4,1,1/1/2014,"Had a delightful tapas dinner here on a recent Sunday evening. The platter of meats and cheeses, the simple chorizo dish, the patatas, and the garlic shrimp were all very well prepared. They forgot our order of the octopus, but we were plenty full so no harm, no foul. We washed it all down with a nice bottle of rioja. We were still engrossed in conversation after we finished our bottle, so they continued to top us off from their open bottle at the bar -- now that's good service."
5451,7,3,1,12/28/2013,"I came here with my husband for a date night and was slightly disappointed. The ambiance is good. Cozy and welcoming. Kinda of dark with the exposed brick walls. I liked it. What I was not impressed with was the food; we ordered pretty much everything off the menu, ˜because that's what we usually do. Lol I can honestly say that the OCTOPUS WAS THE BEST!!!!!! Most tender and juicy. ˜One of the few you can find in the city. However, all the rest were just ok... not blown away. Blend, not much flavor, ˜greasy, etc. I would come back here just to have some drinks and the octopus. Not for the entire dinner meal though."
5452,7,5,1,12/28/2013,"My boyfriend and I have been coming to Nai for years and when my brother came to town with his fianc?, it was a no brainer that this is where we would be taking them. We went on Thursday so we saw the amazing Flamenco dancers and, as usual, the food was perfect. We ordered multiple pitchers of Sangria (red, champagne, and blueberry champagne) and each was more tastey than the other. Some of the best Sangria we've had. Our favorite dish is usually the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas aioli, and mussels. Can't wait to go back soon. Hands down our favorite place in the city."
5453,7,4,1,12/26/2013,"Is this place real? Or did I dream this glorious dinner experience? Not really sure because everything about our night and experience here was AWESOME and for such a great price. Located in the East Village on 1st between 10th and 11th, I have passed Nai many times, and never thought anything of it. Nai came recommended to my friend Rachel which was perfect since we were craving two things: tapas and sangria. Okay... Where do I begin? Our waiter was one of the most attentive, friendly and knowledgable people I have ever encountered at a restaurant in this city. The service we experienced throughout our 3 and 1/2 hour meal at Nai Tapas got me thinking about how fantastic service has become rare, and we have just gotten used to mediocre service and being rushed in and out of restaurants so the next party can be seated. This is not the case at Nai. We enjoyed our dinner with warm welcome, as we were continually told to take our time, and thoroughly enjoy our food and drinks. And thank you sir, we did just that... On top of the 5 star service at this modest, authentic Spanish restaurant on 1st Ave, they offer happy hour until 8PM. $20 pitchers of sangria, with 4 flavors to choose from, the most important and insanely delicious being: the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. Rachel and I shared 2 pitchers throughout the course of the night and couldn't get enough. It was probably the best sangria I've had since sitting on the beaches of Spain, and with a sweet, bubbly, fizzy, happy buzz from the champagne. (I brought another friend 3 days later for happy hour). Nai offers a long menu of authentic Spanish tapas, ideal for ordering a bunch and sharing. This was a mission within itself since we wanted everything on the menu. Luckily for us, our waiter provided helpful tips, how they are prepared, and his personal favorites. They start you off with a baguette and olive oil, while you take your time and peruse the menu. We ordered seven tapas throughout the night, two or three at time, to stagger the flow of our meal while we enjoyed each, and sipped our sangria. Everything we ordered was fresh and flavorful, transporting me right back to Spain for the night, four blocks from my NY apartment. What to order: Fried goat cheese balls wrapped in Serrano ham with a slice of tomato on toast. Amazing. ($6) Gambas Al Ajillo- Grilled shrimp in garlic sauce. Garlicky, plump shrimp. ($6) Bacalao Frito- Chunks of cod, lightly fried. Fresh, crispy, and perfect with a squeeze of lemon. ($6) Patatas Aioli- Potatoes in a garlic aioli sauce. Crispy potatoes. Creamy garlic aioli. Unreal. ($5) Caracoles- Escargot in our house sauce. Escargot. Butter sauce. ($5) Albondiguillas Estofadas- Stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce. Tender, rich in vibrant spices. ($5) Stuffed peppers with ham and Manchego cheese, topped with Quail eggs. Over easy quail eggs. Melted cheese and ham on toast. ($7) Coconut Flan (Not pictured since we devoured so quickly). Delicious, creamy, sweet, tons of coconut. ($5) What I've been dreaming about for our next visit: Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados- Seasoned pork loin with fresh roasted red peppers Pan Tumaca- Toast with a coating of tomato, topped with serrano ham & manchego cheese Madrid Tropical- Baby spinach, avocado, hearts of palm, sliced oranges, walnuts, red onions & strips of red peppers tossed in our house vinaigrette Mejillones A La Cerverza- Mussels cooked with shallots, garlic, cilantro and lager Pulpo A La Gallega- Spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika Croquetas De Jam›n- Serrano ham croquettes"
5454,7,5,1,12/21/2013,"Very warm and inviting place. Wait staf is helpful and very friendly. Tapas were wonderfully tasty, especially the oxtail. You will love Nai"
5455,7,5,1,12/20/2013,"Really like this place! They have house-made sangrias, live flamenco entertainment thur/sat 8:30pm and 10:30pm. The tapas recipes are very interesting, they're specifically Galician. Very cool! We did not make reservations, and I strongly recommend that you do, but they were so nice and tried their best to seat us."
5456,7,4,1,12/20/2013,"Four of us came out here last night to enjoy the late night flamenco show. Nai is your typical East Village underground establishment: quaint but makes the most of its size to create convivial environment. Exposed brick walls, sconces which emit intimate, cave-like lighting, built in arches depicting the daily life of a Spanish se?orita, and an overall authentic charm that only Tapas places hold the key to. My friend made the reservation for the 10 pm show (no cover charge(!), but it was booked for the earlier time slot at 8:30) and I would definitely recommend proceeding with reserving in advance because the place gets packed tighter than boquerones. For drinks, we decided to stick with the sangrias which were amazing. The regular version had the perfect balance of sweetness and one bite into the apple revealed that the fruit flavors had been replaced by liquor splendor. We also went for a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria which was absolutely delicious. I only had about 2 glasses and I was definitely feeling their effects quickly (though I'm sure the drunken fruit had something to do with that as well). The show is absolutely amazing. Willa Bronce, the Romanian Gypsy who gives most of the solo performances, is stunning. My eyes were transfixed as we watched her dig her soles/soul into that dance floor, whipping her hair around like a whip and clapping her castanets with the vigor of a crab's claws. The music, at once hypnotic and sultry, is sensational and makes for quite the passionate evening. My only complaint is that I wish the show was longer than the set hour! Nevertheless, it's places like Nai that make me thankful I live in a city where I could easily bask in the heat of a flamenco show without having to travel to Spain. I'll definitely be back to Nai for some more flamencho fire and perhaps even a tapas or two."
5457,7,4,1,12/17/2013,"Awesome, awesome drinks! very good food. We tried at least 10 dishes and were not disappointed with any. We also went on a Flamenco night and enjoyed the performance."
5458,7,5,1,12/13/2013,"I have been on the lookout for a good tapas place in NYC. So far I've been underwhelmed. Everything has been alright so far. Nai Tapas stepped it up a notch. Could it have been that I was mildly intoxicated with their DELICIOUS blueberry sangria? Probably. You're saying to yourself: ""Blueberry sangria? That can't be! Also, I hate blueberries, so NO!"" All I have to say back is: SHUT UP AND GET IT! My lady-friend doesn't like blueberries either (I know, why am I still with her?) but she was all over their sangria. BLUEberry? More like HAPPYberry (Get it? You do). We had a selection of different tapas to accompany our drinks: patatas bravas, chorizo, meatballs, cheeses and a host of other stuff that I can't remember. The main take away: run, don't walk here. Stop everything that you're currently doing. Facebook can wait. Tell your boss the TPS reports are coming in late (and yes, you will remember the cover page this time). ""But Jaime..."" you say (God, you're whiny today), ""How's the service?"" When I say that I wanted to be best friends with the wait staff, I mean it. They are super friendly and helpful. They also play great music that made me feel as if I was back in Spain. Bottom line? Do I really need to write it? I mean, you're pretty certain this places is like Spain, but in the city. I gave it five stars and spent 4 paragraphs (oh God, this makes 5!) talking about how amazing it is. Do yourself a favor and stop reading. If you're still moving your eyes to follow these words, you're an idiot. STOP! Direct your body towards Nai Tapas. Now. You can thank me later in between swigs of sangria."
5459,7,4,1,12/13/2013,"Made a reservation here this past Tuesday for 6 p.m. I arrived around 5:50 with my cousin and we were the only diners here for until around 6:30 (then it started getting busy). We were greeted and seated promptly, our server (forgot his name) was excellent throughout the whole night. He came to our table quite a few times asking how our meal was, refilling water/alcohol, and we shared a small conversation about my upcoming backpacking trip to Europe. We ordered large everything (except asparagus). Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), Mejillones R­as Baixas (mussels), Pintxo de Chistorra con Huevo de Codorniz (spicy chorizo/quail egg/manchego cheese toast), Chorizo Riojana (chorizo/potatoes/egg yolk), Rabo Guisado (braised oxtail- the winner at our table), Esparragos Navarros (white asparagus- first time trying, we didn't like this. kinda too mushy for my liking, and no taste. the server did inform us of the difference though between white and green asparagus), & Tabla de Quesos y Embutidos (assorted cured meats/cheese). After ordering, our server asked if I've ever been here before because I ordered all their favorites/popular dishes. I said nope, but Yelp brought me here! So thank you fellow Yelpers! EVERYTHING (except the white asparagus) was DELICIOUS! The bread basket they give you is also perfect for dipping in the sauces/delicious goodness. We also ordered a pitcher of Tropical Sangria, and it was good. Maybe a little too fruity, and we didn't taste all that much alcohol, but that could be because we are alcoholics in training. I will try the other sangrias next time. I really liked this restaurant's food, and I would come back again. The GREAT SERVICE we received here was a cherry on top of a great dinner!"
5460,7,5,1,12/11/2013,"AMAZING. ˜Service, food, music... Can't recommend Nai Tapas Bar more!"
5461,7,5,1,12/10/2013,"The best spicy clams of my life. Almejas Diablo. Spicy, salty, savoury. Simply amazing. They were ao delicious that I wiped the sauce with the bread. And I NEVER eat the bread. Gambas al Ajillo - after the clams, this was my second favorite. Perfectly cooked shrimp (hard to come by) in a garlic olive oil sauce. Wine - great Sangria! The rest of the wine selection is so-so"
5462,7,5,1,12/10/2013,"I took my date here Saturday night and we had a blast. We didn't have reservations, which was my mistake, so there was a 45-minute wait. The host was very accommodating though, and he provided us with bar stools to sit on while we waited. The waitress was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious, and the entertainment was great--a very festive and appropriate atmosphere. Highly recommended."
5463,7,4,1,12/7/2013,"Pomegranate sangria FTW! Service is fantastic and prices are very affordable. The paella however was more like a rice dish and not in the traditional pan with all the crunchy deliciosuness on the bottom, still good but I had different expectations. Mussels were amazing! Did I mention the pomegranate sangria? It is a MUST!"
5464,7,4,1,12/6/2013,All of our dishes were amazing. The best ess the chorizo over playfully pepper and toast topped with fried quail egg and manchego. Highly recommend!!
5465,7,2,1,12/6/2013,"Having heard great things about this tapas bar, my friend and I decided that we would catch up over some wine and tapas here. Alas, the tapas just don't compare to the lovely plates at places like Casa Mono or Boqueria. For sure, Nai is nowhere near the same league as the aforementioned. Although the dining room only had one table seated when I arrived, I contributed that to our early meeting time. Because, as we were heading out, the dining room was near capacity. Maybe I should have taken the empty tables as a sign when I walked by and canceled my reservation, but I hate scrambling for another dinner option at the last minute. Plus, what's the harm in trying a new place? We opted for a pitcher of blueberry-pomegranate champagne sangria. I appreciated the fact that they have quite a few options that don't use red wine as a base. Not that I don't like red wine, but because it makes me sleepy. The sangria was not overly sweet, slightly tart and quite refreshing. And, since we were dining early, we got the entire pitcher at happy hour prices ($20)! That's probably the only part of the dinner that I enjoyed besides the company. The waiter suggested 2-3 tapas per person, so we figured 5 would be a good number. Pan Tumaca - barely toasted bread with barely a drop of tomato juice topped with serrano ham and manchego cheese. I should've known not to order this when I saw that it was topped with ham and cheese. When I order pan tumaca, I really just want garlicky tomatoes on nicely toasted bread. What a disappointment. Pulpo a la Gallega - octopus with paprika, olive oil and salt. I was looking forward to grilled octopus, but this seemed boiled and tossed in the paprika and oil. It had a mushy texture and some pieces seemed to have this oddly gel-like consistency. Gross! Bacalao Frito - basically fried fish nuggets served with an aioli. Nothing special and the batter was not crispy. Patatas Alioli - potatoes in a garlic alioli sauce. The potatoes were not crisp enough and absorbed all the alioli sauce, which just made it even soggier. Caracoles - escargot in a house sauce. I didn't completely mind this only because the snails came in a really good garlic sauce. I would've liked if more had there been toast to soak up all the sauciness. I made do with bread from the bread basket and sopped up the sauce - no shame! Maybe we ordered wrong, but I can't say that I was impressed with any of the dishes we ordered. And even though I liked the sangria, it wasn't something that would bring me back to this place. I'm guessing that most people come here because the price points are low, but I'd much rather pay more and enjoy my food than cheap out and have a bad dinner. Sorry Nai, I'm going to have to say nay to a next time..."
5466,7,5,1,12/6/2013,"Came here for my friends birthday dinner at around 8:30/9 on a Wednesday. Let me just say, the place is a tad hard to locate (literally wandered on the same block aimlessly for a good minute before I looked up and OH! well...THERE IT IS!). The service here is AMAZING!!! Our waiter Unueo (prounounced UNO, like the card game), gets an A++ for his top notch recommendations, funny jokes, and impeccable service. He was not only attentive, but paid extra attention to tiny details for the birthday girl (ie: big ol' sangria glass with extra fruit and our mini surprise, a slice of cake with candles at the end of dinner). This guy was nothing short of AWESOME! PROPS TO YOU SIR! Onto the food...The sangria pitchers on Mon-Wed are $20 (they have around 6 or 7 options to choose from flavor wise). We tried the champagne sangria as well as the mango flavored one. The mango was more on the sweet side while the champagne was perfect for me, not too sweet or strong. For 3 girls, two pitchers was more than enough! As for the tapas, they have two options: tapas and regular size. We did 6 tapas and 2 regular sizes, which was a lot more than we originally decided to order, but we somehow managed to finish it! A few favorites: Churrasco (skirt steak) - cooked perfectly and had a side of their own version of chimichurri sauce(ask for extra!) Mussels in paprika sauce - the sauce was amazing!!! We did not allow him to take away the sauce after we were done with the mussels and ate the entire thing of free bread soaked in this very sauce, haha! Shrimp in garlic sauce - We all loved this one too, and my friend kept saying ""I cannot believe I just dipped all the bread in oil and garlic sauce"". It was really THAT good! Oxtail - tender and juicy! A recommendation that was def on point if you enjoy oxtail as much as I do. A nice and cozy spot that I've heard has some type of music show on Fridays. Probably best to avoid it if you're planning to talk a lot!"
5467,7,4,1,12/5/2013,"The good: -- free flamenco show on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8pm and 10pm -- delicious food -- amazing sangria choices -- good location in the trendy East Village The bad: -- can get crowded during flamenco shows -- forget to have a conversation during the flamenco shows -- service can be average (a bit slow at times) -- can get expensive, but not too expensive"
5468,7,4,1,12/4/2013,"This place is lovely! The staff is super friendly, and helpful. coconut crepes stuffed with shrimp: this was probably the best thing we ordered. anchovies served over toast with fresh minced garlic: after reading the Serious Eats review: ˜newyork.seriouseats.com/? we decided we had to order this. Neither of us have ever tried anchovies, we may not order it again-I think we're just not anchovy fans. fried goat cheese over a slice of tomato & toast wrapped in imported Serrano ham: how could this not be good? Serrano ham croquettes: this was a favorite stewed meatballs in a brandy sauce: again, Serious Eats raved about this and it was very good. The sauce is delightful with bread."
5469,7,5,1,11/20/2013,"Whenever I have someone visit me from out of town, I bring them here. The staff is great. Very friendly and attentive. The menu is amazing. Lots of variety, fresh tasting, savory, and not too expensive. They have specials on the sangria (many kinds) and a large beer list. I've gone without a reservation, but it takes a second to make one through this site. Even the olive oil they give you with the free bread is delicious, and I loove olive oil."
5470,7,5,1,11/18/2013,"5/5 stars for me. What a place! A definite must go to on a Thursday night or Saturday night. Bring a date, bring a friend, bring a grandparent, bring a stranger! 8:30 and 10:30 on both nights they have Flamenco dancing with Reynoldo Rincon and his family (wife, son, daughter). They do two shows while everyone is eating and talking at their table and it is electric. The traditional dancing, the atmosphere, the energy. Now, to the food! The waiter, Julio, was a huge help. As a group of 4 men he suggested we get 8 tapas. We selected 2 each. I won't go through them all but they ranged from octopus to sardines to serrano ham croquettes to goat cheese stuffed olives. Julio was upset we didn't two of the best sellers (shrimp in garlic sauce and a churrasco with quail egg), so he brought them out anyway. ˜UNREAL. We had a few pitchers of red sangria and some after dinner traditional sherry. What an experience. Don't think this is a seafood place only, there are plenty of non-seafood tapas to try. Sit at the bar, get a table, just make a reservation! Until next time."
5471,7,4,1,11/14/2013,"3 for food and 5 for atmosphere and energy and if my math is still sharp - SOLID 4 stars Must get here for a flamenco show on Thursday or Sunday. ˜They start at 8:30 or 10:30 so make sure to book in advance because it is as original as it comes (visited Madrid and exactly the same). 10 or so different tapas but the ABSOLUTE must order is the ostrich egg with sausage tapa. ˜The churrasco was also tender and excellent. ˜I unfortunately cant remember the others but all relatively good. ˜Finished off the meal with a couple of light desserts (coconut flan and chocolate cake), maybe they weren't the lightest haha, but you can't go wrong with any of them. Will certainly be back!"
5472,7,5,1,11/12/2013,"I went to Nai this past Saturday after I had booked a reservation for 4...for Sunday - ouch! ˜The host (David) handled the situation as perfectly as you could ask for. ˜He discretely informed me that I had booked for the wrong day as to not embarass me in front of my party. ˜Then, he gave me the option of waiting to see if he could find us a space at the bar or come back another time. ˜After about 10 minutes, not only did David get us a space, he got us a full table. ˜The place was packed so I don't know how he did it, but he pulled it off. After the phenomenal service from David, it continued from our server as well. ˜He was patient with our group as it took us a little while to figure out everything we wanted to order. ˜He was knowledgeable about the menu when asked, and paced the meal just right. Amazingly, the food was just as good as the service! ˜We ordered about 6 different dishes each one better than the last. ˜The empanadas were amazing! ˜When it was all said and done, the bill came to about $130, extremely affordable for 4 people including 2 large pitchers of sangria. I never Yelp but because I had such an incredible experience at Nai, I felt the need to share. ˜I will certainly be back soon!"
5473,7,5,1,11/10/2013,Great food. We were in a large group and had a blast. Pulpo a la gallega was my favorite.
5474,7,5,1,11/5/2013,"The food, atmosphere, and drinks give this place an easy four stars. The service bumps it up to five. The staff did an incredible job making out-of-town guests feel comfortable with ordering tapas, and were extremely attentive on both drinks and food. Love this place!"
5475,7,5,1,11/3/2013,"So glad I just found a new favorite! I decided to go to dinner for my birthday last Friday for my birthday and arrived with a group of 10. The manager was so accommodating and the service was great. A friend brought cupcakes for dessert and the staff refrigerated them until we were ready and did not charge an additional cake fee. The food was delicious, and very authentic. My favorite was the chicken croquettes but I enjoyed everything we ordered. There are six flavors of sangria and we sampled 4 of the 6, all really good! Since we went on a Friday, I missed the Flamenco show but I will be back soon!"
5476,7,4,1,11/3/2013,"A breath of fresh air aming all the overpriced tapas places in the city. Nai is what a real tapas bar should be. Good assortment of tasty small plates, laid back atmosphere and friendly waiters. The food and ambiance reminded me of the tapas bars in Spain. It's not refined or anything, but simple, flavorful and artery clogging. Great place to meet friends and shoot the breeze. Recommend the chorizo rojo, gambas ajillo, manchego & jamon, setas and last but not least a giant pitcher of sangria."
5477,7,4,1,10/31/2013,"Wow! Number one tip for this place: Go here on a Flamenco night and request a table in the dining area to see the flamenco show. ˜The flamenco show itself makes this place 5 stars. ˜The food on the otherhand is a measly 1 (wah wah wah...). ˜I think my favorite food there was the olive oil that came with the bread, but the flamenco and the service is so worth going for. My boyfriend took here for our anniversary; it was an amazing choice. ˜We reserved a table for the second flamenco show of the night and arrived to an extremely packed restaurant. ˜We had reservations for 10:15 and didn't get seated more towards 10:45 or 11:00. ˜It was kind of crazy 'cause there was a large party and they had to kick other people out to accomodate those who had made reservations for the show. I wasn't entirely too happy 'cause we got seated behind another table but it worked out perfectly in the end. ˜Once the music started, it didn't matter where I was in the restaurant. The guitarist spoke oceans of emotion with his hands that elegantly strummed his guitar endlessly throughout the night while the flamenco dancers casted their feet to the beat of the music as they spun and twisted their bodies around stage with vigor. Aside from the music/flamenco, we ordered the tapas that Yelp reviewers said were their favorite and ordered a couple of half pitches of sangria. ˜The sangrias we got were both good. ˜The servic was slow but our waiter was so friendly and nice so I didn't mind. ˜Plus, there was a ˜really large party so I understood. ˜We got an octopus dish, meatballs and empanadas (a seemingly safe choice) but they were all pretty terrible/over salted. ˜I could tell they used good ingredients but something just went wrong in the kitchen, multiple times. ˜However, flamenco was so good it was really easy to overlook the bad food. I just know for next time not to order food here. In summary-- ultimate power play-- Have dinner beforehand at someplace with better food, come to Nai Tapas Bar for the flamenco show and orders lots and lots of drinks like Sangria to experience the flamenco and the friendly, awesome service."
5478,7,5,1,10/29/2013,This place is fantastic. My friend and I came here last night for tapas and left happy (and mildly drunk from the brandy soaked apples we consumed in our $20 sangria pitcher). The service was excellent in that they were very attentive but not hovering over us every 2 minutes. Every dish we had was delicious and made with quality ingredients. I believe they also have live flamenco music on Thursdays and Saturdays. I will definitely return!
5479,7,5,1,10/28/2013,"Amazing Tapas Restaurant in East Village!! Been twice already and i cant wait to go this weekend. Made a reservation for the flamenco saturday night show and it was spectacular! Awesome food, the goat cheese balls, crepe with seafood and the ground beef pocket bites are to die for!! Service really friendly and courteous!! Music and show something else. Looking forward to go again!!"
5480,7,5,1,10/28/2013,Best sangria ever the food is amazing I love this place the service is great plan ahead and make reservations. ˜The flamenco show is awesome tho the guitarist is kind of freaky but he can play is A$$ off. ˜The food is amazing except the squid on its own ink that's just not for me but everything else is great. ˜GO!!!!!!
5481,7,4,1,10/27/2013,"Fun and lively place! There was a 30-45 minute wait on a Saturday night which wasn't so bad. I would recommend making reservations if you can plan ahead. My favorite items are still the blood sausage and coconut flan. We also tried: Shrimp in garlic sauce: The garlic sauce was amazing. We dipped everything in that garlic sauce (our skirt steak, octopus, everything). The shrimp themselves were okay. Churrasco: The skirt steak was pretty bland and chewy. The dipping sauce was too tangy. Wouldn't order again. Octopus: After having the best grilled octopus at Marea the night before, I was really disappointed with the bland boiled octopus here. Mussels in paprika and wine sauce: Very good! The mussels were so tender. Mango sangria: Very refreshing. Tasted like white wine with a hint of mango. Even though our waiter recommend 6 plates for 2 people, we were already stuffed with our 5 plates! Next time we are going to order 6 plates of blood sausage and leave extremely happy."
5482,7,4,1,10/24/2013,"Came here for dinner with a group of 8 friends. Food was GREAT! Their tapas portions are a good size. I did not feel ripped off like certain tapas places that serve 2-3 bite size pieces on a plate and charge you $20 for it. Out of the 8 dishes we ordered, I definitely recommend their chicken croquettes, patatas alioli, braised oxtail, chorizo over toast with quail egg and manchego cheese, and piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod. The skirt steak was good, but nothing i've never had before. Their mussels in paprika wine sauce was decent...but the actual mussel was kinda small. We also had their berry pomegranate sangria and mango sangria. They tasted great...especially the pomegranate. All in all, the bill was $34 per person. Great price, great food. The only thing we didn't like was the loud flamenco performance, I lost my voice talking over the music and loud noise. Other than that, the restaurant is definitely worth checking out."
5483,7,4,1,10/21/2013,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience at Nai Tapas including a tasty set of small plate tapas and Flamenco dancing!! ˜The staff was very friendly and the food was delicious. We first started off with the braised oxtail and seafood croquettes. ˜Both dishes had tremendous flavor and provided a good start to a great evening. ˜Then came the meatballs, chorizo, and patatas aioli dishes. ˜All three lived up to the same quality. ˜The beef empanadas came next. ˜A delicious classic course that we both enjoyed. The next course was the calamari. ˜This was probably the least favorite dish of the evening. ˜We both enjoy sauteed calamari but this lacked the flavory taste of the previous dishes. ˜However, the shrimp and garlic and skirt steak dishes more than made up for the disappointment of the calamari. ˜Both dishes had a flavory taste that satisfied our appetite. ˜The tasty dishes also came with complimentary entertainment of flamenco dancing which really created a great atmosphere for dining. ˜Overall, it was a tremendous evening of food and entertainment!"
5484,7,5,1,10/20/2013,"I was just here again last night for my best friend's birthday, and I cannot put into words how amazing this restaurant is. For service, I would give 10 out of 5 stars, and for food, I would give 9 out 5 stars. It's just that good!! Everybody -- especially Uno, by whom I was served most times I'd visited -- is super duper friendly and caring, and you can just tell that they actually enjoy working there (if not, they're insanely good at hiding it). I brought a homemade cake to celebrate my friend's birthday and asked if it'd be okay for us to eat it after our meal. At first I was worried that they would frown upon it, but on the contrary, Uno was so nice about it, kept the cake in the kitchen until we finished eating and brought it out with a lit candle. He then cut it into slices for us and even packed up the leftovers and washed the plate I brought! We left one slice for Uno (with a generous tip, of course) as a token of our appreciation :) As for food, get the coconut crepes with seafood filling. These will SERIOUSLY change your life and also go great with any of their sangrias (my favorite is tropical). Chorizo con cebollas is also great, as are the meatballs. I've already been here many many times, and that says a lot for me because I rarely ever go to places I've been before. Will DEFINITELY return soon. foodcomalogs.blogspot.co? foodcomalogs.blogspot.co?"
5485,7,3,1,10/6/2013,i've definitely had better tapas but i can't complain. it could be a lot worse. had an early dinner there and it was very very empty! but i have heard that it does get crowded due to the flamenco dancing later in the evenings. i'd have to say the little chorizos are delicious
5486,7,1,1,10/3/2013,the meat and cheese platter - ˜the meat being cheap pizza topping and the cheese was like the inner sole of a converse all star bought on the bowery in 1941 . the rioja was similar to carlo rossi mixed with chateau diana .. the waitress asked us if our food was good before at had even arrived !!! this place sucked . big time . hasta la vista .
5487,7,5,1,9/22/2013,"Went here last night for my girlfriends birthday. We both live in NJ and decided we needed a night out in the city and through going through a couple of friends, I opted to take her here. ˜The food and the sangria were both unbelievable. ˜There was a little bit of a wait which was totally understandable for a Saturday night. ˜But we bellied up to the bar for some red sangria which was perfect. ˜When our table was ready out waitress was fantastic, suggesting some shrimp only based seafood tapas and a few other big sellers. ˜Everything was prepared fresh and delicious. ˜The icing on the cake, everything including tip was 105. ˜Perfect night in the city."
5488,7,5,1,9/21/2013,We stopped by before heading to our dinner spot for happy hour. ˜$5 for a glass of sangria $10 for half a pitcher. We asked the bartender what to order and she recommended the blueberry champagne sangria and it is indeed the best sangria I have ever had . ˜She recommended about four or five tapas items and we ended up with the mussels with white wine sauce. ˜Must say these were scrumptious . ˜ It felt like I was in Madrid again! We dipped the bread into the sauce til it was all gone. We will definitely be back again!
5489,7,3,1,9/17/2013,"Nice food, great live flamenco music. ˜Get's crowded with long waits and limited seating right before shows so recommend showing up earlier."
5490,7,2,1,9/14/2013,"I came here at a recommendation of a coworker who couldn't/wouldn't stop raving about this place. ˜He's been here couple times and each time he would show me pics of the food he and his friends had ordered. ˜And I must say, the pictures looked amazing. I came here full of expectations a few weeks back on a date night w my bf. ˜I knew I was coming in on a night where there was no flamenco performance so I was counting on the food to deliver. We ordered 5 dishes. ˜Only one was outstanding... the others were edible, I suppose, and one dish was outright disgusting. The shrimp and garlic sauce was the best I've tasted in NYC. ˜Hands down that dish was the highlight of the dinner. ˜We also ordered blood sausage (i'm adventurous and I was trying to get my bf to be as well). ˜The dish came with two tiny baguette slices with even tinier halved blood sausage smaller than the size of my ring finger (my fingers are short and thin). ˜It didn't taste bad b/c I couldn't taste anything the thing was so tiny!! ˜The potato with paprika was good. ˜And I don't recall what the fourth dish was, but I vividly remember the disgusting pepper stuffed with salted cod. ˜On the menu there were two ways the stuff pepper can be served; with salted cod or with cheese. ˜I thought the server had brought us the one stuffed with cheese instead of the cod we ordered b/c the stuffing was creamy (liked instant mashed potatoes but cheesy tasting). ˜He insisted it was the cod, so I have to take his word for it it wasn't the cheese one. ˜Whatever it was, I couldn't bring myself to take another bite after the first bite. ˜My bf just assumed baccala tasted like that. ˜Seeing as I've never had baccala, I couldn't attest to its taste but the thing that was stuffed inside the peppers was nasty. ˜Ugh. ˜And the waitress said this was her favorite dish, too!! ˜I felt cheated somewhat. ˜But she was very nice and the service was good. ˜Though I doubt we'll be back here again. Back to Las Ramblas for my tapas!!"
5491,7,5,1,9/12/2013,I absolutely love this place! It is cozy. The service is unbelievable! And every single dish we ever ordered has been awesome!
5492,7,4,1,9/11/2013,"Years ago, on a search for tapas bar flamenco, we were directed multiple times to Xunta (yelp.com/biz/xunta-tapas?). Unfortunately it closed before we got around to it, but Nai opened (literally) in Xunta's place in 2010. Two bits of advice to help you enjoy your time here: 1) Come on a flamenco night. 2) Come on a flamenco night. Nai does the same flamenco shows as Xunta: Thursdays and Saturdays, 8:30pm and 10:30pm. Tables are empty until JUST before flamenco starts, at which point people swarm in. If you have no reservation, your best bet on these nights is to try to snag a table between sets, around 10pm, when service has geared back up and some parties are leaving. Otherwise, you don't want to be one of the unhappy masses huddling at the entrance, lining the wall, staring gloomily into the merriment inside. Try somewhere else. We arrived early with the intent of taking our sweet time with dinner and drinks - a good idea since service is slower during the show. The red sangria was pretty good! I like the half pitcher option (tip: it's the size of a regular pitcher at Las Ramblas yelp.com/biz/las-ramblas?). They also have 5 other flavors (white, mango, etc.) for you sangria heathens. As for food, racions (the next size up from a tapa) of oxtail and pan tumaca arrived at our table promptly. The pan tumaca (a.k.a. pan con tomate) is served with slivers of serrano ham and was great. The oxtail was beautifully tender and not at all difficult to eat since it fell off the bone so easily. Typical tapas, like patatas (bravas or alioli) and chorizo a la plancha, are skippable. The patatas were just not that good. The chorizo was very salty, and I was befuddled that the raw egg yolk placed on top was fully cooked on the bottom, as if they had fried an egg and snipped off the whites prior to plating. ?? Our waittress also recommended a new dessert - basically beignets with blueberry goat cheese, and it was absolutely lovely. At this point we were horribly stuffed, and just looking for excuses to stay for the rest of the flamenco... ...which was excellent. Holy vaca, such duende!! Flamenco is more of a furious, passionate spectacle than it is a sexy dance, and the three dancers went all out. You could really feel the rapport between them and the guitarist. There were a few birthday parties in the room and to everyone's amusement, the birthday women + man were called out at the end for an impromptu flamenco lesson with one of the dancers. It was kind of hokey, but you can imagine this makes Nai a perfect place for large groups. Everyone in the room was in a great mood, and the flamenco really contributed to the positive energy. Maybe the sangria helped a tiiiiny bit. Last but worthy of note: Our waittress was super amazing. Friendly, full of recommendations and knowledge about the menu... She appeared exactly when we wanted something, but never hovered. On top of the fact that Nai is a reasonably priced tapas bar with great sangria and really fun flamenco shows, the awesome service was really the icing on the cake (or, the alioli on the tortilla?)."
5493,7,5,1,9/8/2013,"Relaxing atmosphere, great service and amazing food at reasonable prices. By far the best tapas I've had to date. Having visited Barcelona and eating my fair share of tapas and sangria while there I can say it truly makes me feel like I'm back in Barcelona. The croquetes de jamon are a MUST !"
5494,7,4,1,9/8/2013,"Good Lord! ˜7 for tapas, make a reservation. ˜Always make one for huge groups! Flamenco performance transported you to the streets of Barcelona where dreams are made of Rioja and Serrano Ham. ˜Casual and homey. ˜Get inebriated on culture and a myriad of fruity sangrias. ˜Paella, Tortilla Espagnola, Croquetas de Jamon, Pulpo a La Gallega, Gambas al Ajillo, Mejillones Rias Baixas- Winners at our table. ˜Bread flows like wine, so you can get your sauce on. Escargot was a little goopy and all I tasted was garlic-but whatever. Empanadillas de Atun- Amazing. ˜ Great Service, they understood my terrible muddled Spanish and didn't shrug me off like a gringo. ˜The service was rapid and attentive. Beware- if you tell them its your birthday, guess who's dancing with the Flamenco dancers....Do you even lift?"
5495,7,2,1,9/7/2013,"Meh. It's all right. I think the best thing about this place is that its GREAT for groups. If you are looking for a decent place for a group dinner this is the place to go. We ordered a bunch of things on the menu, theyre all pretty average. The only thing that pops out are the weak Sangrias... weak... I should reference this at my next AA meeting."
5496,7,4,1,9/1/2013,Service - Good. Held our reservation after I told them we were coming late. We were still able to get the happy hour special when the clock hit 7. Mango Sangria - Light and tasty. The waiter recommended mango and blueberry sangria as the lightest sangrias. Still enough alcohol to make some of us (not me) red. Esparragos Navarros - White asparagus with pink sauce. It was definitely more tender and bigger than normal asparagus. However it is quite expensive - the large has only 4 pieces. It's something you would try once for novelty and not again due to the price to food ratio. Mejillones Avoa - Mussels in paprika wine sauce. It was a bowl of many small mussels as opposed to a few big ones. Sauce is perfect for the mussels but too salty for dipping bread in. Tasty and pretty good deal for the small size we ordered. Churrasco Arriero - Skirt steak. It came medium-well done. A little chewy but it was still good and flavorful. Not a fan of the dipping sauce though - mango salsa? Didn't really go with the steak. Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos - Assorted cheeses and cured meat. It was alright. Chorizo and potatos - I forgot the dish name and it's not listed here. The chorizo and little diced potato pieces were equally tasty. I want more! Overall pretty good food and I would definitely come back another time to check out the many other menu items and sangria flavors.
5497,7,4,1,9/1/2013,"Great tapas place. Check out the pulpo a la gallego, really good. Usually crowded. Service is very good as well (nice staff). Good spot in the east village."
5498,7,4,1,8/29/2013,"It was a great experience. The bartender was fun to talk with, she said she was from Zaragoza and very cool. She recommended me great drinks. The waitresses were very cool and you can have tons of fun with. The food was ok. The environment was wonderful!"
5499,7,4,1,8/22/2013,"I really like this place, it has a very casual and homey feel inside. My friends and I were seated at a table for 8, near the flamenco area (which I'll get to later!). Decor and service were great, so I don't have any complaints about that. We tried both the mango sangria and the blueberry champagne sangria; both were great. Not heavy on the alcohol side, and the fruitiness definitely came through. The tapas were great. Recommendations from our list were the chorizo a la plancha, gambas al ajillo, albondiguillas estofadas, and any of the croquettes. All of the food was pretty good, but prepared to order at least 2 or 3 plates per person; this is a tapas restaurant after all. The real reason we came on this Thursday was for the flamenco. It was a lot of fun to watch, mesmerizing at times with great music. It's definitely not an experience you can normally get. All in all, it's a fun place to go if you're in the mood for tapas, and definitely one of the better tapas restaurants I've been to. They don't have traditional jamon iberico, however, which is something I always look for at a tapas place, but otherwise, it's certainly good, and cheaper than many other tapas places out there."
5500,7,4,1,8/22/2013,"Enjoyed my meal here food was 3.5 star but our waitress was awesome so I bump it up to 4 stars We came here on a tuesday for their happy hour. Their sangria is truely delicious as the reviews suggested. Really liked the red one and the mango sangria is also very good, but a bit too light/sweet for me We got the Churrasio Arriero which is steak served with red peppers on the side. This one was just ok. The steak could be a bit more tender Patatas Bravas: potatoes in this spicy ketchup. Good but nothing special Croqutas De Jamon: Ham croquette. My favorite of the night. Delicious we also got an order of the mix seafood, forgot the name, it was just all right Overall, a very pleasant experience. The waitress, this African American lady, ˜was super sweet, nice and professional. She made the whole experience awesome. Will definitely be back again."
5501,7,3,1,8/21/2013,"Go here for tapas if you can't find another spot and must have tapas or the location is extremely convenient. We ordered their mango sangria and were underwhelmed. For food, we had the croquetas de pollo, skirt steak, mussels in avo sauce, and patatas bravas. None of them were bad but nothing was the best or close to best rendition of anything I've ever eaten. The avo sauce with bread and the skirt steak were probably the highlights of the meal. I make better croquetas at home and the patatas bravas were no where near as delicious as my old favorite, Mercat. The waitstaff was mildly attentive but not up to NYC caliber. I reserved on open table and honored my reservation. Nai marked me as no-show even though I showed up exactly on time. Open table resolved the issue but it was just a bummer that I had to deal with that. No other of the 39+ restaurants I've reserved through open table have ever done this to me so I'm rounding Nai down to 3 stars."
5502,7,4,1,8/20/2013,"I was in desperate need of a last-minute Friday night dinner reservation for 9 people. I was surprised to see that Nai still had availability on such short notice, so I went ahead and made the booking. Service: 5 Food 3.5 The service here was absolutely phenomenal! I had called several times to change the reservation and they never gave me a hard time. Our waitress was friendly, made great recommendations, and checked in on us regularly. She encouraged us to try a different flavor of sangria ($25 pitchers, yes pleasee), and even offered to replace it if we didn't end up liking it (which wasn't an issue since it was delicious). The food was great, don't get me wrong. The meatballs were bomb, the assorted croquettes were flavorful and flaky, and I definitely recommend the skirt steak. The patatas bravas were a bit too mealy (the potato chunks were just too big to get crispy), so you should opt for the patatas alioli instead. However, nothing stood out or wow-ed me in particular. All in all it was a fantastic experience. The layout and seating was not cramped, the ambiance was warm and friendly, and I would certainly recommend this place for anyone planning larger group dinners."
5503,7,3,1,8/16/2013,"This place is a reasonably priced tapas bar in East Village that draws crowds with its cheap sangria and weekend flamenco dancing. Alas, we missed the flamenco. Our reservations were too early in the evening but we did enjoy some of that cheap sangria. I feel like we must've ordered the majority of the menu, but the one takeaway was the Pulpo a la Gallega was very very good. Super fork-tender, not at all chewy, I don't think I've ever had octopus that good and at much more esteemed restaurants. In fact, the octopus would probably be the only reason for my return to Nai Tapas. The rest of the food was pretty unmemorable, your standard patatas bravas and croquetas. The Mejillones R­as Baixas were the smallest, most pitiful mussels I have ever seen, but came steeped in the most fragrant garlic / white wine sauce. Much bread-dipping ensues. Anyways, it's an affordable tapas restaurant with decent food, and I'm sure if you're on your third glass of sangria and watching a lively Flamenco performance 2 feet in front of you it's a damn good time."
5504,7,3,1,8/11/2013,"Nai Tapas had solid food in terms of quality, but unfortunately re-affirms my belief that tapas restaurants that are too into the idea of 'tapas' never feed you enough... When we went, there was no flamenco performance, so perhaps we missed out on a key part of the Nai experience. That being said, we asked the waiter for recommendations and consequently got what he thought were the 2-3 best dishes in every major food category. The food was all tasty...but somehow, even with only 3 of us, we only got a small bite of every dish that came by. If you want an 'authentic' experience, perhaps with flamenco, then Nai might be worth considering. If you want a filling, hearty meal though, perhaps consider somewhere else..."
5505,7,5,1,8/11/2013,Excellent service and food. My gf and I went there and it was a nice surprise. Great sangria and the tapas was really good.
5506,7,5,1,8/8/2013,"I had a blast at this place! I have reserved through open table for my friend's bachelorette party (4 ppl) at 7 on a Sat night and asked to be right in front of the flamenco performance. Around 2pm of the day I received a confirmation call for the reservation. Nice! So as all of us know that girls take a while to get ready and of course we were late about 20 min. (But I did call around 6:30 to let them know we are running late...the person on the phone was nice about it) When we got there our table was already waiting for us and not a minute wasted we were seated. The portion of the plate was small and if you choose the tapa size instead of the regular size, it's basically 3 pieces to 6 pieces. Even tough it makes a bit harder to split between 4 ppl but our waitress, Jenn, who is awesome by the way would put in one extra for us. I'm not expert on authentic tapas food but I enjoyed our food. We kept the sangria coming and many glasses and cheers were raised. It can be loud but that's expected at this kind of place. So if you are looking to pour your heart out to your date please go somewhere else. The flamenco was spectacular! I never seen one before but to have the opportunity to watch it so closely was sensational. The rhythm and passion coming through the dance is so vibrant and you just want to get up and dance with them. Our super ˜amazing waitress secretly put in a request for a shout out for the bride-to-be and they invited her to the dance floor! She was so exhilarated to have the whole restaurant cheering for her while she danced and it was the best highlight of her night! Overall, great service, great ppl, great food and it's priceless when your good friend was kissing goodbye her single hood with a loud bang!"
5507,7,4,1,8/7/2013,"My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this place. We had a reservation and had to wait around 30 minutes. We had just arrived to the restaurant when the manager said our table would be ready in 2 minutes. Just as the 2 minute mark was up, 2 horribly snippy females strut in the door right past us and look at the open table and go ""I see our high top awaiting us!!!!!"" and walk right over. The manager was extremely friendly and apologized for the rudeness of the girls, offered us a free pitcher of sangria and a spot at the bar while we waited. We were in no hurry so this was fine for us. The place was pleasantly crowded with a good atmosphere (Friday night around 9pm). We had trouble picking out things on the menu cause everything seemed appetizing. We ended up going with the garlic shrimp, chicken croquettes, beef empanadas, meatballs in brandy sauce, and the patatas aoili. Everything was amazing! We were happy with every single dish and it was very difficult to pick our favorite. Great staff and atmosphere, and good food! I'll definitely come back sometime."
5508,7,5,1,8/6/2013,"Ever since I went to Barcelona, I've been on a search for a Spanish omelette as good as the one I had there. Nai Tapas is as close as you can get! All the tapas that we tried were excellent. I really think you can't go wrong with anything you order here. Not to mention the prices are so reasonable! I came with a group of 3, we ordered 5 or 6 tapas, a salad, and a pitcher of sangria, and the bill only came out to $88! That's pretty freaking awesome if you ask me. The atmosphere is also really nice and cozy, it felt like being in Spain. Bonus - on Thursdays & Saturdays they have a flamenco show which is really cool and entertaining to watch. Also, it was a friends birthday, and they bring all the birthday people to the stage area and give them a quick flamenco lesson - awesome!"
5509,7,5,1,7/31/2013,i cant stop coming to this tapas bar! certified best meatballs i've ever had in my life! and the sangria is awesome! not watered down or too strong...great date night place with entertainment!
5510,7,3,1,7/31/2013,"I wish I was as impressed with the food as I was with the service. I had read great reviews on Nai Tapas and I had wanted to try it for a while now. It was friday night, my friend had just come back from her Europe trip and I had lot to catch up wit her. I was looking for a quiet place with happy hour drinks, small bites and good service. We arrived there at 6:30 pm, we were seated right away even though we were still waiting for one more person to arrive. Our waiter was charming and had great marketing skills. We ordered a pitcher of mango sangria. This was our first time trying mango sangria, we didn't know what to expect. But the waiter gave a big go ahead for it. The drink was good, wasn't something i would drink on regular basis, but for a warm weather it was refreshing.We ordered 6-7 tapas dishes. Being a fish lover, i really enjoyed my Sardines. They were fresh and cooked to the right amount. Patatas Bravas, Chicken Croquetes, Seafood Paella, Oxtail were few of the other dishes we ordered. I didn't try the oxtail, but my friends really enjoyed it. The other dishes were just ok, was edible but not delicious . I was a lil dissapointed with our paella. I imagined a paella from my barcelona trip with lot fo shrimps, muscles, squids and clams. But for 17 bucks, the portion was really really small, it literally had 3 pieces of seafood and 4 spoons of rice. Since our waitor kept asking us how everything was, i gave him an honest review for the paella. He took my review very well, promised to pass on the comment to the chef and even gave us a small discount for the paella. We ended the meal with coconut Flan. I liked it."
5511,7,4,1,7/30/2013,"Nai Tapas is awesome. ˜Great service, wonderful food, totally priced affordable, and great sangria. ˜Do you need anything else? ˜The only reason why I'm not giving it a 5-star rating is because I think Alta and Casa Mono are better, but from a value perspective, this place rocks! ˜I highly recommend the establishment - be sure to book your reservations in advance as this place usually sells out."
5512,7,3,1,7/29/2013,"I've had a lot of fun at this place. I came with a large group of about 8 or so and it was a free-flowing party of tapas and delicious sangrias and nobody was wanting for anything. Afterwards, they played flamenco music, so a few of us got going on the dance floor. It's super tiny and not fancy at all, but I have really great memories in this place."
5513,7,4,1,7/29/2013,"Love this place. Tapas in the city can get very expensive very quickly but this is not one of them. Some of the best tasting tapas items I've ever had, not to mention their Sangria is off the charts. It's on the smaller side so on a Friday or Saturday night there can be a bit of a wait, but hey it's Manhattan what do you expect. Come during the week and you'll probably be seated immediately. And enjoy."
5514,7,5,1,7/28/2013,"I love this place. Food is great, inexpensive and the flamenco really entertaining."
5515,7,5,1,7/25/2013,"Solid, authentic spanish tapas. Nothing crazy or fancy, just good food. ˜And great waiters."
5516,7,4,1,7/22/2013,"Spent this past Saturday night at this wonderful little place celebrating my wife's birthday along with 15 friends/family. The staff was fantastic. Service was top notch and food was great. We opted for price fixed menu which included a nice cross section of great delights along with various different flavored sangrias. The mango flavor was a favorite. The chicken croquets were great along with the spicy cheese squares, the sausages, curry chicken and meatballs. The entertainment was GREAT. The performers were gracious and extremely talented. The music and dancing were both top notch. I rarely offer reviews, however the combination of GREAT and caring management along with an equally up to the task staff and wonderful entertainment made this night truly one that we will remember with smiles for a long time to come. Anyone debating of where to go for a great evening filled with something different, the debate is over.... this is the place."
5517,7,4,1,7/22/2013,"Went with a group of girls for a fun night out. It's the perfect atmosphere to sit, drink sangria and try some tapas! We absolutely loved the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria!"
5518,7,5,1,7/21/2013,"This is my favorite Tapas place in the city. My best friend and I love going to Tapas bars and we come here at least twice a month. I have yet to had a tapa that wasn't good and they sangria is amazing. They have so many different flavors. My favorites are the red sangria and the blueberry/pomegranate/champagne sangria. And on Thursdays and Saturdays, they have flamenco dancers. I have yet to go then, because I never plan enough in advance, but I'm hoping to go soon. I highly recommend checking this place out. You won't be disappointed."
5519,7,2,1,7/20/2013,"I really do not understand how this place has gotten so many good reviews on here or open table, how I originally found out about this place. Our waiter rushed us through our meal from the moment we sat down. Mussels were not good- half of them did not open and the rest were un-fresh and tasted bad. The ""spicy broth"" they were in was oily. When I told the waiter about the mussels and tried to send them back he took the dish and just walked away. We were charged for them... Egg omelette was very bland. Bathroom was filthy, smelled,hot and floor was VERY unclean. I was extremely disappointed by the poor service and food. I would not go back here. The placed was filled with younger people and young couples on dates.. maybe they just don't know any better."
5520,7,4,1,7/14/2013,"Service was great, Mango Sangria was awesome, a tad on the loud side but after a few glasses of Sangria, you'll be just as loud. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the price for two after a couple of hours made me very happy. ˜I highly recommend this place."
5521,7,4,1,7/12/2013,"Came here for my birthday dinner an had a great time. Not sure if the food tasted so good because of all the sangria we drank lol but I absolutely loved the meatballs patatas bravas, and beef empanadas! I would definitely go back."
5522,7,4,1,7/10/2013,"I love this place, their mango sangria was a refreshing kick to the summer heat. The dishes are usually pretty tasty, the shrimp with garlic was my favorite. The left over sauce was great to dip the bread with. However, the mussels this time had a weird smell to it. Probably shouldn't be ordering shellfish during hot summer months."
5523,7,4,1,7/8/2013,"The tapas here are pretty awesome. I'm not sure if it is awesome because they tasted good, or because the servings were so small that everything tasted good. I'm pretty sure it was a mixture of both that made the food taste good. I ordered 5 plates of items that were most popular and of items that looked good on Yelp photos. I shared it with a friend and thoroughly enjoyed every small bite. Their Flamenco show was awesome! If you come here, make sure you make a reservation for the show! It really made my night. The dancers were so talented! They also have pitchers of sangria, loved that as well! Overall, the experience was awesome but thats because a show came with my dinner."
5524,7,2,1,7/2/2013,"Peeps must be too drunk from the sangria to taste the food here! Yes, it's a fun place. Yes, I was tipsy from the awesomely cheap sangria deal. Yes, I was PUMPED that they had olives stuffed with anchovies-- literally, that's all I snacked on when I was in Spain and the Basque Country a few years ago. Excitement ended at the olives. The octopus, which came highly recommended from our waiter, was overcooked, mushy, and badly seasoned. Also unimpressed by the fish dishes (all overcooked) and asparagus (mushy too). Everything else was mediocre. The service was awesome and they did take a couple items off the bill because we were disappointed. But still, there are tapas places popping up all over Manhattan so I'd really only come back for the sangria and flamenco..."
5525,7,4,1,6/29/2013,"Went to Nai for my birthday with 13 people. They could not have been more accommodating, responsive and helpful. The experience was well beyond expectations and I will definitely be back. In fact, I bet all of my 12 guests will go back on their own. The Flamenco is not cheesy, as some might think. It's a real surprise in an otherwise mundane city of restaurants with no oomph. What to order... Gambas Ajillo - shrimp in garlic sauce - superb! Croquetas De Jamon - Serrano Ham croquetttes - a very nice dish! Croquetas De Pollo - chicken croquettes Albondiguillas - meatballs in brandy sauce- so delicious! Patatas Alioli - potato in creamy garlic sauce Patatas Bravas - potato in spicy tomato sauce Tortilla Espanola - Spanish omelet Churrasco - skirt steak sauteed with spicy cherry peppers and garlic Chorizo Plancha- grilled Spanish sausage Bacalao Frito. - fresh cod loin lightly fried."
5526,7,5,1,6/24/2013,"Great service. Our waiter was really helpful and funny. He gave us some great suggestions for tapas and all of them were delicious. The sangria there is also quite amazing. We got pitchers of the mango and the blueberry champagne sangria, which definitely satiated our sangria craving. I will definitely be going back soon!"
5527,7,4,1,6/23/2013,"This small tapas bar in the E. village serves up some pretty tasty food. ˜You walk in, and it looks exactly like a bar with a full bar to your left and various tables surrounding. ˜The workers were all nice and friendly, ˜The pitcher of sangria was only $20 and you have 4 or 5 different flavors to choose from, and best of all it was a full pitcher. ˜We tried around 6 or 7 things, all were good. ˜Definitely a solid place if you are in the mood for some tapas and cheap drinks."
5528,7,3,1,6/22/2013,"So these are the times you wish the Yelp stars can be categorized. ˜First time to Nai this week and it is a really fun place - great young crowd, super-nice/responsive/helpful wait staff, great assortment on the menu, and very decent prices for food and drink. 5 stars for all of that. ˜Lots of birthday dinners going on so certainly a fun place to come with a crowd. ˜ My only disappointment came with the tapas itself....much of it simply average...definitely not bad...but just average. ˜Would have like to seen a bit more creatively & sophistication with the construction of each dish instead of layers simply being slapped together. ˜All the food came quickly so perhaps that was the trade-off. ˜ Likely to return but my expectations have been adjusted."
5529,7,4,1,6/14/2013,Great place to eat! ˜The menu covers a wide range of food (all good). ˜The service was great and the location is cozy. ˜I can not wait to go back.
5530,7,5,1,6/11/2013,"Came here on a Friday night for happy hour with 2 of my friends. We got a half pitcher of sangria for $10 and 6 tapas to share, and they were fantastic! All tapas were fresh and yummy and the drink was great and stronger than I expected! We got here before 7pm when it was fairly empty, but it was a full house by 9pm. The service was one of the best I've had in the city for its price, and it was consistent throughout the night despite the growing crowd. It's a great spot to chill with a small group. I shall be back again soon!"
5531,7,5,1,6/10/2013,"Fantastic service, friendly bartenders, great food and dynamite sangria's. Thursday night they had flamenco dancers that were just awesome. Definitely a regular now."
5532,7,4,1,6/6/2013,"3.5 ˜or 4....the staff/service was outstanding, the group we went with all loved the food and we had a great night so 4 it is :) no true liquour which was very sad for the frozen margarita or mojito lover in me ..just beer wine and sangria (delicious and perfectly spiked!!) awesome tapas selections and each one we ordered was a hit! the waitress (jenn i believe) was very helpful! here goes: Churrasco Arriero - steak was perfectly cooked, very juicy and tender with light sauce, enough meat to share for at least 3 people Gambas En Salsa Verde - shrimps were a little too cooked for my liking but the sauce was amazing; good for sharing with like 2-3 Mejillones R­as Baixas - all the mussels had some meats in them so that's a relief and it was tasty, good enough to share with at least 3-4 people Patatas Alioli - the big hit of the night in my opinion...very very garlicy but perfectly cooked potatoes! shareable for like 2-3 Salpic›n De Marisco - this is that one tapa that you get and dont share because you wanna taste it all! so refreshing and tasty."
5533,7,4,1,6/3/2013,Yum. Great food and the sangria.... ay!
5534,7,5,1,5/26/2013,"Love this place! The atmosphere, service, and the food were wonderful. Double points for the flamenco dancers who danced so amazingly. I would definitely check this place out :)"
5535,7,4,1,5/23/2013,"The Good: - AMAZING atmosphere - Book early/reserve for a table in front of the Flamenco dancing. They have a live show every Thursday and Saturday! - I will be coming back and bringing vistors for the spectacular show. I paid a lot of money in Spain and this was equal if not better. And it's FREE with dinner! - Try the 'Gambas Al Ajillo' - shrimp in garlic sauce from the tapas menu. - The host and waiter were both INCREDIBLY sweet and helpful with the menu and explaining the intracacies of the dishes. The Bad: - Very disappointing food! - I did not enjoy the garlic potato dish - doused in mayonnaise nor the tuna empandillas, however, I did not try enough of the menu The Details: This place is VERY loud if you come for Flamenco dancing (9 - 10 PM on Saturdays at least) so sit further back if you want to have a conversation. But that's Flamenco for you - the heel stomping is incredibly loud."
5536,7,4,1,5/21/2013,"Great food, especially the croquetas! Fast and good service. Good value for money. Lively atmosphere, although a bit loud if you're planning on talking to your company the entire time. Only thing I'm annoyed at is the restaurant told Open Table that I did not honour the reservation, which my party and I obviously did."
5537,7,3,1,5/18/2013,"No one was by the door to accommodate new customers. We had to wait and wait until someone acknowledge us. The waitress explained the menu to us basically the whole menu to her was good. Anyways we got the Pan tumaca which was like a bread toast topped with serrano ham & manchego cheese. : this didn't turn out as I expected it to be, it didn't work with one another especially the cheese. Beef empanadas, they called the turnover: I always call for this just to be on the safe side whenever I come to a Spanish restaurant. The meatballs: again a must have in case the other tapas is no good. Pulpo A La Gallega which was octopus sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika. This dish was too salty. Pollo Al Ajillo chicken with potatoes in garlic sauce. The chicken was too dry. I also tried their mango sangria. Next time I won't go exploring other sangria. Red sangria is always the way to go. Service was fluent."
5538,7,5,1,5/10/2013,"Truly an awesome brunch experience. ˜Beautiful paintings, great latin music, awesome sangria (multiple choices), great food, and excellent service. ˜I must admin that we were one of 3 tables that were there at the time, so I can't speak to the service when it's busy. ˜But we had a great experience all around. We tried the following: - Churrasco Arriero - Gambas Al Ajillo (Shrimp in Garlic Sauce) - Pulpo A La Gallega (Octopus in Olive Oil) - Patatas Bravas (their version of home fries) - Stuffed peppers - Another shrimp dish (can't recall) - Two sangrias (red and peach/mango) And all were very very tasty! ˜Within those, the must-tries were definitely the Churrsasco, Shrimp, and Patatas Bravas. ˜But they were all good! I would definitely recommend!"
5539,7,5,1,5/7/2013,Great service and great food! :)
5540,7,5,1,4/14/2013,"We tried to go for dinner and the show, but the early seating (8:00PM) was full. ˜Instead we went for the 10:00 PM Flamenco show on Saturday. ˜Having just come from a very big dinner, we did not order a meal. ˜However, we soon regretted being so full as the entrees around us (and the reaction of the other patrons to the food) looked great. ˜ The show was fantastic and the music and dancing were both terrific. ˜I wish the sound system was a bit better. ˜We were literally in front of the musicians and sometimes it was hard to hear the vocals and acoustic guitars. ˜That said, it was a great show; very passionate dancing and music. The service was polite and efficient. ˜We literally ordered a club soda and coffee, but the waiter was all smiles and attentive. ˜The check was about $6.00, with no cover, so we tipped $20.00 on top of it because we had taken a table for the whole show. We will definitely be back to eat dinner"
5541,7,4,1,4/14/2013,"Happy hour before 7pm!!! :) We got half pitcher of Sangria for 10 dollars.. Their most popular sangria is the red sangria.. I will recommend getting that because you will get more ""alcohol"" compare to the tropical/mango or other fruit taste.. And I personally prefer red sangria compare to the white sangria.. I came here on a thursday night at 6pm.. I guess it's the day before good friday.. The restaurant was fully book and we can only get seated at the bar.. It's ok because the bartender lady was really friendly.. She recommend us all the ""good stuff"".. The tapas (""good stuff"") - Patatas Alioli potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce: It's basically just potato with garlic sauce.. I would recommend to order this as a tapas dish but not a bigger portion because it's pretty filling after a few pieces.. - Clams in spicy sauce.. We dip the complementary bread into the spicy sauce.. We both love spicy food.. The clams is pretty good and I like it because it's not ""burning"" spicy but you get to taste the flavor I have to be honest.. I was so hungry that I ate most of the food and I kinda forgot what we ordered.. - something with cheese at the back of the menu.. It's one of my favorite.. I am wondering how can I forget.. - some spicy chicken.. I will not comment much on it.. since all I remember was DELICIOUS.. I have to say Nai Tapas Bar is one of the best tapas place I have ever had.. Cheap & Delicious + friendly waiter + good & cheap sangria!! I will return again!"
5542,7,5,1,4/14/2013,"This is place is great. The food is really good. We got 4 tapas for 2 people. The tapas did not come all together but one after the other one. I don't know if they do this on purpose, but it improved the experience a lot. I guess it works if you are sharing all the tapas. If you are not sharing, you might end up eating at different times. We got the following: Gambas En Salsa Verde: delicious and good size. Croquetas De Bacalao: tasty, but somehow small. Only 3 little pieces. Patatas Bravas: Good amount of potatoes. Pulpo A La Gallega: Nice ending to a great dinner. Along all this food, you get (unlimited?) amount of bread will olive oil. The waiter tried to convince us to order one more tapa at the beginning, but these 4 tapas + half a pitcher of sangria (with red wine) was the perfect amount of food. At least for us two. Service is also really good. An on top of this, if you go say a Saturday around 8.30 or 10.30, you get a flamenco show. Pretty entertaining. I wouldn't go there for my birthday, unless prepared to dance flamenco. The place is a little pricey, but taking into account that you get a show and good food, it worth the experience. I'm glad my girlfriend took me here, hehe."
5543,7,4,1,4/10/2013,"Been to this place twice and it keeps me wanting more. The mussels, anything chorizo, and croquetas are delicious. Service has always been pretty good and the beer selection is what is to be expected of a Spanish place (Estrella). Only had the Sangria once and that was during happy hour (pitcher seemed watered downed). I must come on a Thursday or Saturday - I believe they have flamenco dancing."
5544,7,4,1,4/9/2013,"My friend was visiting from SF and wanted tapas - though I've never been to Nai, I made a reservations and was glad that I chose this place. Though I didn't need the reservation (the place is pretty empty on a Tuesday night at 7 pm), I've been turned away during the weekend before, so I didn't want a repeat of that. We ordered: Gambas Al Ajillo - really flavorful, garlicky shrimp Bacalao Frito - fried cod, not super heavy, like fried fish is normally Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos - peppers stuffed with cod - really tasty, one of my favorites of the evening Patatas Alioli - potatoes with spicy mayo - good, nothing unexpected Empanadillas De Atun - also one of my favorites for the evening, tuna stuffed empanadas, really flavorful and LOTS of sangria The food was amazing - I liked everything that we ordered. The sangria was also really good, they had a lot of different types (we tried all) but I think my favorite was still the classic red sangria. The bartender was really friendly and helpful - she made a bunch of suggestions and wasn't pushy at all. I'll definitely come back when I'm in the mood for tapas again!"
5545,7,3,1,4/8/2013,"Atmosphere 3.5 Decor 3.5 Food 3.5 Service 4 So I wanted to get Tapas, and this was the only place I could make last minute reservations for. I arrived to dinner 10 minutes late for my reservation, and my friend was already there. They wouldn't seat him yet, because the whole party had to be here before they seat you (I understand that, that's pretty normal). But when I arrived, no one came to help us out, and when someone came, he helped out this couple that had just walked in right past us and had an 8:45 reservation, and then the server walked away...we waited for a whole 15 minute before someone came and seated us. After we were seated, the service got much better. The servers were really helpful in answering our questions, and helping us make our selections. Further more, my phone was out of batteries, and my friend had a charger, so we asked them if they could charge my phone. They were really friendly about it, and looked for a free outlet for me without a fuss :) The decor of this place is quite cute. Very rustic with wooden tables. Beware though, the wooden tables (at least mine) sloped downwards, so first, my eating utensils rolled in the napkin rolled on the floor, I picked it up, and put it on the table to get the utensils out so I can put the napkin on my lap, and the fork and knife fell on the floor -- how embarrassing. There was not a great selection of tapas, it was someone limited. A lot of seafood, very little meat. We ordered a churrizo, the garlic shrimp which is meant to be good, the octopus, the asparagus stuffed with anchovies and the meatballs in brandy sauce. All in all, food was above average. It tasted good, food was well seasoned, but nothing really wowed me, or left me wanting more. The sangria was great though, we had the red sangria. I like my sangria with a lot of fruits, this one just had a few slices of apple. As a summary, this place is OK . Probably a solid 3.5. I would not be able to give it a 4 though."
5546,7,3,1,4/7/2013,"Came here after reading Yelpers reviews. It was Friday night, my friend used Open Table to make her reservation. Got there before the end of Happy Hour (Pitcher Sangria special). Haven't seen my friend for a while, started to chit-chat. The waiter came over three times to confirmed our reservation, asked us when we're ready to order. So finally we gotten to order from the menu, which had quite a big selection. We ordered 4 tapas dishes to try, but the waiter said we should get one more dish to be full. Taste wise it was okay, wasn't all too special. The skirt steak came out a bit tough, the octopus was tender yet kind of bland. My friend liked the Proscuitto wrap goat cheese ball a lot, too filling for my taste though. Price wise, was expected for East Village restaurants."
5547,7,5,1,4/5/2013,"Love, Love, Love, this restaurant! The food is amazing and the wait staff is equally as wonderful. ˜We have been here a number of times and have never had a bad experience. ˜Their garlic shrimp is perfectly cooked and tasty. ˜Their ham and cheese croquettes are one of my favorite things to eat here. ˜The flamenco shows are awesome. ˜Oh, and the drinks are priced well and are tasty but pack a punch. ˜Can't wait to go back!"
5548,7,4,1,4/3/2013,"Very good authentic tapas served in a cool relaxed atmosphere. ˜Prices are reasonable and drink selection is solid, from spanish beers ive never tried before to commendable sangria served from three barrels set behind the bar. A gimmick, yes, but its a nice touch and it works. ˜Nice wine selection as well. ˜All told, nice place to go with a date or with friends any day of the week."
5549,7,4,1,4/2/2013,"They are only losing a star due to the fact that even though we booked, we still waited 45min for a table. I am new to NYC so maybe this is normal? Other than that, once we had our table, it was amazing! The waitress did a great job recommending food items and they were all delicious. As for the sparlking white wine Sangria, I have no words. The staff were all really friendly and the place has a buzzing, cozy atmosphere. I definitely recommend it...I am now craving Tapas just from writing this review!"
5550,7,5,1,4/2/2013,"Nice selection, great service and tasty food. Can't complain! Chorizo anything rocks. I can't wait to go back again!"
5551,7,4,1,3/30/2013,"This might be my new favorite tapas place. The garlic and shrimp, white asparagus, and mussels were delicious and I couldn't get enough of the mango sangria. But I didn't like the goat cheese with ham - goat cheese is tasty by itself, it doesn't need to be deep fried. The flamenco dancers and musicians were really talented and fun to watch. I liked how they would grab everyone's attention to watch the dancers and then play more quietly so people could converse. The atmosphere is very intimate so bring a date!"
5552,7,4,1,3/21/2013,"The waitress was patient and willing to educate us about a cuisine that we didn't know very much about. She seemed genuinely interested in making sure we had a good experience. The ""house red"" was on special for happy hour and it was a good value. Would happily return. There are tapas left to try."
5553,7,5,1,3/20/2013,"Absolutely wonderful! Great bottle of wine! Amazing Tapas! We had: Salteado de gambas, Mejillones rellenos, Pelotollas de queso de cabra, Esparragos rellenos, Churrasco arriero, Solomillo a la naranja! All delightful! Service was great!!"
5554,7,5,1,3/12/2013,"I came here for my birthday. The tapas were pretty good and the waitress was very helpful in picking out the tapas to try as well. We had the patatas bravas, beef empanadas, Chorizo A La Plancha, Tabla De Jamon Y Queso, and Croquetas De Pollo. We also had a pitcher of mango sangria to go along with it. All of it was good They also added a chocolate cake with a candle because it was my birthday! Great Service!"
5555,7,5,1,3/11/2013,"I spent 6 months in Barcelona during college, and ever since have craved tapas and sangria to a dangerous extent. ˜Dangerous because usually tapas in the United States in no way resemble anything I ate in Spain, meanwhile they cost 1.5-2 times as much as they should. ˜ Thankfully, Nai Tapas is both authentic and affordable, and I am eternally grateful to my friend Aron for choosing this place for this birthday dinner. ˜The table got multiple pitchers of sangria, and the classic and mango flavors were to die for. ˜The pomegranate blueberry was pretty good too, but the others overshadowed it. ˜Also, this sangria actually packs a punch and is not just fruit and ice, so beware! ˜ I would recommend pairing up with someone at your table with similar tastes, because you don't want to be passing plates to an entire table, it's easier to just split a bunch of stuff. ˜As for ˜my boyfriend and I, we wanted the authentic, weird-sounding tapas for that Catalan experience. ˜ So. ˜We got the escargot in garlic sauce, blood sausage, a raci›n (big order) of patatas bravas, octopus, and olives stuffed with anchovies. ˜The escargot was delectable (I mean what isn't in garlic and oil??), the blood sausage was amazing; great flavor and presentation, the patatas bravas were so authentic and crispy, it really brought me back to drinking Estrella Damm in the middle of the day and eating in Pla?a Reial. ˜The olives were good, but they weren't what I remembered, so I'll give them a pass next time. ˜Really the crowning jewel was the tender, flavorful pulpo a la gallega. ˜There is no faking this dish; if the octopus isn't fresh, it will be terribly obvious because there is no sauce or other stuff to cover it up. ˜Our waiter informed us the dish was so good because they only imported Spanish, cold-water octopus, as opposed to South Pacific octopus. ˜Kudos to Nai for doing it right. ˜ I can't wait to come back and try some croquetas and tortilla! ˜ We also enjoyed the flamenco performance, which was surprisingly authentic as well. ˜The only thing is it made conversation difficult since it's pretty loud, but I wasn't complaining."
5556,7,5,1,3/10/2013,"Came here for a merienda of sorts, on a Sunday afternoon (around 4:00). GREAT SERVICE, which I think is still the case, even when we're not the only patrons in the restaurant. The food was absolutely amazing. We ordered the bacalao, piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod, fried goat cheese and prosciutto on toast and calamari in its own ink, and everything tasted to perfection! The flavor was rich but not overbearing (as should be the case with tapas), the quantity was great (we ordered for 7 people), the texture of everything was just right! We also ordered pitchers of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, which I definitely recommend. No complaints here! Will definitely return!"
5557,7,4,1,3/9/2013,"They have six types of sangria! ˜The blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria was delicious and refreshing. ˜The chorizo a la rioja and pan tumaca were great. ˜The tortilla espanola and stuffed peppers were done well, but bland. ˜The pulpo a la gallega was decent. ˜Service was warm and friendly. I will go back to try the other sangria flavors and other tapas on the menu."
5558,7,3,1,3/3/2013,"The quality of food has declined since my last visit. The octopus was too soft and mushy. The spanish omelet was overcooked and I couldn't even finish it because it was so dry. The potatoes with aioli was good. The other dishes I had were not memorable. And skip the chocolate cake. The wine-soaked pear was good, but nothing special. Sucks that I have to find a new go-to tapas place with consistent quality."
5559,7,3,1,3/2/2013,"The tapas were okay, and would have been much better with some minor changes. I thought the patatas bravas were too soft and should have been crispier. The Pan Tumaca would have been much better withOUT the spicy tomato paste spread on the buttered toasted bread. The Churrasco Arriero - skirt steak was the best and the Gambas Al Ajillo wasn't bad. However, our sangria was watered down. On another note, we came here on a Thursday evening and it was ridiculously loud because of live performers and dancers. We were seated near the front and couldn't see the performers and just heard lots of 'clacking' from the dancers' finger cymbals. They also appeared to be understaffed, with one waiter and 2 bus boys and service was really slow."
5560,7,5,1,3/2/2013,"Yummyyyy tapas!! 4 people - 9 tapas dishes. Happy hour from 5-7, $20 pitchers of sangria. Who could ask for anything else? Mussels - They were so succulent and moist. The broth the mussels were cooked in had such an intense briney flavor. Typically I'm not a fan of mussels but cooked this way I would order 2 servings of it. I actually ended up taking the mussels out and putting it on the bread after dipping it in the broth. Definitely something I would order again next time I visit. Escargot - There were only about 6 pieces of snail but the garlic sauce the escargot was cooked it - was absolutely divine. If it wasn't so embarrassing I would have totally licked the garlic off the plate. Pairing the garlic with the bread definitely made it all the while worth it. Definitely something I would order again as well. Ham croquettes - It's like a higher level of mozzarella sticks...but even better. There weren't that much ham inside the croquettes but it was so hot and melty delicious you can't help but go for a second piece. That cheese is so good. Goat cheese with serrano ham, tomato and toast - This was definitely the prettiest tapas plate of the whole evening. I'm not a fan of goat cheese but the combination between the ham, toast and tomato helped cut down the goat cheese flavor. Not a fan of the goat cheese but definitely a tapas dish to try if it's your first time. Chorizo with onions - Who doesn't love chorizo? This dish is better than the chorizo with fried potato because there's more of it. The carmalized onions cut the salty spiciness of the chorizo with the sweet greasy onion taste. I also paired the basket bread with the chorizo and it was perfect. Definitely another dish to order on the next visit. Chorizo with fried potato - This tapas dish comes with four pieces. Even though the fried potato did well as a starch base for the oily chorizo there weren't a lot of flavor bursting through it. This is something you can pass - it is something any person at home can make on their own. Patatas Bravas - It is fried potato squares with a spicy drizzle. Every tapas place has it - so is it worth ordering? Probably not. I would like to order another patatas dish though since it is a starchy element (it also helps fill up our stomachs). Shrimp with garlic sauce - One of the best dishes of the night. They gave us around 5-6 pieces of shrimp and the garlic sauce was mouth watering. It had the right amount of garlic undertones but then the broth hits other seafood notes and just elevates the little bowl. This paired with the bread was also a winner. Definitely definitely a reorder! Meatballs - Meh. Meatballs are meatballs. My friend commented that the Ikea meatballs are better. They weren't awful but I would order another tapas plate over this anytime. For sangria, we ordered the mango and blueberry. The mango sangria reminded me of one of the V8 tropical juices but spiked with wine. It was vaguely sweet with a touch of bite (probably from the lemon slices we kept mistaking were orange). The blueberry sangria was stronger and actually didn't really taste like blueberries. It definitely had some hints of sparkling wine because I kept feeling a fizz (probably my buzz). We opted to not order dessert since Venieros was across the street. Our waiter was great - hilarious and picking on us the entire night. We had a ton of fun being sassy with eachother. He gave us this little jar of Hot Mama's Belize pepper jelly that is like a little jar of crack. Just tried it today with fried chicken and it was delicious. (I'm actually going to hunt down a bigger jar of it and smother it with all the fried chicken I can find in the world.) I've never been a fan of tapas since they never seem to fill me up but then again we also had 3 baskets of bread to fill us up and the total ended up being around $35 each with the sangria and it was great. I definitely would love to come back and try their other tapas dishes. FYI - there's only 1 bathroom in the back. ~happy eatings!"
5561,7,5,1,3/1/2013,"Spaniard style food is incredible and if it's not in Newark, its often hard to find a good place in the tri-state area. This place blew me away. The tapas are absolutely fantastic. I had one of everything on the menu (having gone two nights back to back I was able to try everything). For desert, I highly recommend flan de coco. It, honestly, is the best flan I have ever had in my life, and if I could eat flan every day, I would (i love it that much!). If you can, definitely reserve a table when they have their Flamenco performances. It was beautiful and made the experience what it was. The bartender is amazing!! She encouraged us to come back the next night to watch the Flamenco dancing. If you can, sit at the bar! I usually hate sitting at bars, but this bar is soo much fun to hang out at b/c of the bartender. She is the best!!"
5562,7,5,1,3/1/2013,Great place. Very friendly. Good tapas. Good wine. Great performance of flamenco. Awesome music. I didnt want to leave! :)
5563,7,4,1,2/28/2013,"So fun! We arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We managed to find seats at the bar and the service was great. I'm a huge fan of tapas and having recently been to Barcelona, I had high expectations. Nai met those pretty well! Really large selection of dishes that you can get as tapas or raciones. The night was topped off with an impressive flamenco performance by some very talented and passionate dancers. Seems like it would be a great place to celebrate a birthday - the dancers brought up people who were there for special occasion and taught them some flamenco steps."
5564,7,3,1,2/17/2013,"Cute restaurant but filled with college aged diners. Food was good but not exceptional. Sangria weak. While I had a great night, I dont think I would go out of my way to come here."
5565,7,5,1,2/16/2013,"It's more like 4.5 stars only because the food is sometimes lacking and their sangrias miss a certain pezaz. ˜ Overall the atmosphere is fun - especially on flamenco nights! ˜The crowd is happy and the waitstaff all do a good job. ˜The food is overall very delicious - especially their seafood - SO MUCH YUM! ˜ The tapas are a little pricey - that's really the biggest gripe. But hey - they have a nice location in the east village that they need to upkeep. ˜ I brought many people here, and they still talk about how great this place is!"
5566,7,4,1,2/14/2013,"A fun restaurant, great place to go with a group of friends. Delicious Sangria and wonderful flamenco performance. Its a great place to hang out and have fun. The server brought us another 1/2 a pitcher of sangria for free after to paid to encourage us to stay for the rest of the set. Overall, the service is slow. Not a place to get a quick bite. It is a Spanish restaurant after all."
5567,7,4,1,2/12/2013,Food is great and service is friendly. Prices are definitely fair and the Sangria is awesome. Especially the berry champagne flavor. But on weekend nights they get packed because it is a small space. Even with a reservation it is hard to get seated - they could do a better job at organizing their reservations. But we were more than happy to sit at the bar when the reservation didn't work out. Nice spot!
5568,7,5,1,2/4/2013,"I had an amazing time, the waiter made it all possible, he was delightful and his food recommendations were amazing!!!!!! the only negative thing i have to say is ˜the person that first greeted me, was not friendly at first but it all worked out at the end and must definately will go back"
5569,7,4,1,2/2/2013,-
5570,7,5,1,2/1/2013,"Love, love, love this place. ˜The most authentic tapas place you can find in NYC. ˜The tapas are actually things you would eat in Spain, for the most part. ˜Some things are better than others. ˜Don't miss the albondigas in brandy sauce. ˜They are incredible. Native speakers that work there, native chef, etc. ˜I love that they have tapas/racion portions just like in Spain, too. ˜Prices are fair. ˜ A must try!"
5571,7,4,1,1/28/2013,"I came to Nai Tapas Bar with a group of about 20 at around 7:15 p.m. on a Saturday. Despite the potential intimidation in numbers during a prime dinner time, that certainly did not show with the Nai staff. They were very accommodating and knowledgeable, and food came out in a timely fashion. The small/large plate option is a great way to try a number of different dishes at a reasonable price, and they were great for sharing. Highlights included the Almejas Diablo (clams in spicy sauce), Caracoles (escargot , already taken out of the shell), Patatas Bravas (potatoes in a house sauce) and the octopus, which wasn't very rubbery like one may usually think when it comes to octopus. Be sure to save your bread to use for the sauces. Two fairly minor nit-pickings in the grand scheme of things deny a 5-star rating from me. While the live music and dancing was quite entertaining and energetic, it was also bit loud, so it was tough to have a conversation with anyone at your table if you were sitting close to it. Also, the staff would combine two small orders into one large order, but since we were in a large group, it got confusing because we didn't know who else ordered the same dish -- it could have been someone 10 people down the line at the other end of the table, and both sides were clueless. If it was a smaller group, combining the two small orders would be a convenient no-brainer. All in all, I'd go again, for sure, and I definitely recommend it."
5572,7,2,1,1/28/2013,"Croquettes are mostly cheese -- can't tase the jamon (and it's not nice jamon either) Meatballs taste like spaghetti marinara Not what I'd expect from a tapas bar The spicy papas bravas are bland and not crisped well Possible I ordered the wrong things, but there weren't as many options for a person who can't eat seafood. I can imagine going here and enjoying trying things with maybe one or two friends, but we had a big group and service was very slow. Took an hour to get my beer."
5573,7,4,1,1/20/2013,"I rarely venture into the East Village, so I would've never known this place even existed had my friend not suggested that we go check it out. The inside is pretty casual and nothing special in terms of decor, but it was packed so it's clearly one of the neighborhood hot spots. From the minute we sat down our waiter (Uniquo I believe), was amazing. We didn't know what we wanted so we allowed him to choose 6 tapas plates for us, and he made perfect selections. I still don't know what they were but they were good :) We also ordered a pitcher of the champagne sangria, and it was delicious and packed a good punch. By the end of the pitcher I felt like we had gotten our money's worth. ˜It wasn't just our waiter that was great. Every waiter and busser made rounds and would check on the other tables around to make sure no one needed anything, which I loved. I would say it's probably not the best date spot because it's VERY loud. It's one of those restaurants where they cramp lots of tables together to fit as many people in as possible, so you're sitting in on your neighbors' conversations (and pretty much on their laps), but it's so loud you can't hear what they're saying anyway. I barely heard what my friend was saying from across the table. I would say that based on the excellent food and exceptional service alone, I will definitely make a trip back to Nai in the future."
5574,7,4,1,1/19/2013,"My three friends and I arrived on a Friday night with a 6:45 reservation and the restaurant was surprisingly still fairly empty. By the time we left around 8pm, the place was pretty filled... so come early so you can 1) get seats, and 2) get the happy hour drink special (a pitcher of sangria for $20) before 7pm! Having eaten a late lunch and afternoon dessert, we weren't that hungry so we ordered only six tapas plates for the four of us. We ordered: - Croquetas De Jam›n (ham croquettes) - there seemed to be way more cheese than ham... or maybe that was just the one piece I took :-/ - Gambas Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) - the tapas portion only came with 7 pieces of shrimp, but it was very flavorful and one of my favorites - Calamari in its own ink - pretty bland.. wasn't a big fan - Caracoles (escargot) - buttery and yummy, my other favorite of the night - Patatas Bravas - fried potatoes drizzled with a sauce that resembled spicy mayo - Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - also a bit on the bland side We also got a pitcher of the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria, which was VERY light and delicious. It tasted like a fruity soda... my kind of drink! Food and drinks aside, the service here was attentive and excellent. We were seated a few minutes before the end of happy hour (7pm) and our waiter didn't get around to giving us menus until after 7, but he let us order off the happy hour drinks menu anyway. My friend had also bought a slice of cake that she wanted to take home, so they let her store it in the fridge until the end of dinner. 5 stars for service! Overall, it's a good place to go with a small group of people, and I'd definitely return for sangria during happy hour!"
5575,7,5,1,1/15/2013,"Best kept secret! My new favorite tapas bar. - Mussels with paprika: a large serving of deliciousness - Hangar steak: tender and cooked well. Even the small portion is nicely sized! - Coquettes with ham: a solid croquette. Not as good as Spain, but it'll suffice and I usually order it - Escargot: AMAZING! I really didn't know what to expect since I didn't have escargot in Spain but the snails were the perfect size and the sauce was amazing! - Chorizo with onions: Good Pitchers of sangria are $20 during happy hour. (I prefer the red) Can't beat that. Love this place!"
5576,7,4,1,1/14/2013,"Get to the Chase: Pros: 1) First thing that I have to say is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING service (very friendly, courteous, and apologetic when it got crowded and service slowed down a bit) 2) Food is decent (Not spectacular, but pretty good) 3) Not too pricey $50 per person includes (10 large dishes + sangria pitcher + tip split between 6 people) 4) Fantastic live Flamenco + spanish guitar on the weekends 5) Sing happy birthday 6) Lively, boisterous, and fun atmosphere 7) A gem in a hit or miss neighborhood Cons: 1) Food wasn't mind-blowing or anything new 2) Definitely need reservations on the weekend or you'll be waiting a while"
5577,7,3,1,1/6/2013,"A fun little restaurant that has great live flamenco performances on certain nights. It can get very crowded and reservations are recommended, but the three of us were eventually able to sit at the bar after a bit of a wait. The bartenders were very kind and helpful. Start off with a Moritz, a sweet and malty beer from Barcelona. It packs a lot more flavor than Estrella, another Spanish beer. Unfortunately, the tapas were not as good as the restaurants I went to in Barcelona. Not that I should expect the exact quality, but they were off by a decent amount and the prices were a lot higher too. The patatas bravas are supposed to be crispy with a creamy aoili and spicy red sauce. Instead, these were soft, soggy, and covered in what tasted like ketchup. They unfortunately did not have the simple pan con tomate (bread with crushed fresh tomatoes). The pan tumaca (bread with tomato, serrano, and machego) was good, but a really small bite. I would recommend squid in ink as mopping the sauce up with bread was probably my favorite part of the meal. The Spanish omelette stuffed with potatoes and onions was quite filling and a good pick as it's hard to get full on only small tapas plates. In the end, it was $30 with a beer and we all walked away stuffed. Not the great tapas meal, but worth a try if you're really in the mood. It at least has an atmosphere to it and is a good place to bring a date."
5578,7,2,1,1/6/2013,"So apparently this is the place where all the Spanish people go to have traditional Spanish tapas...or so I was told. ˜I guess this makes sense, because when we walked in and tried to order, everything was already out for the night - the waiter just shook his head and said ""there were a lot of Spanish here tonight"". ˜He may have said ""Spaniards"", but i suspect my mind changed it to ""Spaniards"" and I fear my mind can be a little racist without my knowledge, so in case ""Spaniards"" is a derogatory term, I'll have to assume he didn't say it. Now that that's out of the way. ˜The best thing about this place? the atmosphere is ADORABLE. ˜If you don't care about food quality, this is a fantastic date place. Amazing. you walk in, and you initially become skeptical because it's ""garden level"" which, as most of you know, means ""basement"". ˜Gross. ˜However, the room opens up to this brick-facade-d, dimly-lit, soft orange/red glowing cozy little nook of a restaurant. ˜Insta-romance, folks. ˜The place is for the guy who says ""i want to make my gal think I'm a little bit romantic and a little bit fun, wrapped in a coating of laid-back."" The food we were able to get our hands on (as everything was out) was a meager order of blood sausage (too dry and chewy but otherwise OK) and a greasy dish of octopus pieces. ˜Sadly, the octopus chunks were all covered in fat and too greasy to get a good grasp on long enough to travel to my mouth, so we left hungry and disappointed. However, the sangria was delicious, the service was great (friendly Spanish man to pop up occasionally when we least expected it), and the vibe was perfect. ˜Will i go back? Sure. but only to sit at the bar and have a drink with friends."
5579,7,4,1,1/4/2013,"Went with a girlfriend and waited a bit. Place is small and crowded, but staff are friendly and food and drinks are good. We sat at the bar and the bartender was nice and attentive. They had huge glass jugs/kegs of sangria of different types. Other drink selections were well diversified. Tapas were all good, though I forgot which ones we ordered since we pretty much got one of each. No complaints here."
5580,7,4,1,1/1/2013,"If you're looking for a tapas bar to chill at with friends, Nais Tapas Bar is the place you should be at. It's definitely an amazing intimate tapas bar that's a must go if you're in the area. Each dish is packed with flavored and the sangria measures the same! This is a good place to celebrate an occasion. The staff is amazingly friendly here & great with suggestions. Everything is also decently priced, which is a plus if you love eating out without breaking the bank!"
5581,7,4,1,12/25/2012,"Had a great time here for my birthday party of 9 ppl. The owner is very professional and a super easygoing, friendly guy who makes your special day as special as it can be. I came on flamenco night and made a reservation 2 weeks before. What was so surprising to me was that I had my reservation confirmed the day OF, via a very nice phone call from the restaurant. The tapas were great. I had a number of their potato tapas, which were so well-flavored - I highly recommend the garlic potato tapas. I didn't like the octopus dish very much and the white asapagus dish was quite bland. Also, I wouldn't get the dish with clams again because it came with about 4 baby clams, but the sauce it was in was quite yummy. The live flamenco band and dancers were a nice touch and entertaining to watch. Oh, and there is a surprise if you are the birthday girl... oh yes, there is a surprise.... OMG and how can I forget the MANGO SANGRIA! SO DELICIOUS! Probably the best sangria in townnn. Get a pitcher, heck get two pitchers!! Every gulp was savory good and gave the perfect amount of buzz."
5582,7,3,1,12/20/2012,"Ate: Gambas, Cod wrapped with potato, pork loin, chorizo Drank: Sangria Liked: Gambas were good. ˜Cute space and very authentic. Disliked: Music was too loud and we were trying to talk. ˜Not their fault, but wasn't our speed. Sangria was weak. Chicken: None! ˜Chicken haters would love this place! Would mom like it?: ˜Mom would go up and try to dance with them to all of our embarrassment. Would I go back: Yes, on a night without the live music. Recommend: Gambas Al Ajillo. ˜That's like the calamri of Tapas places. ˜And I love it."
5583,7,5,1,12/15/2012,"Seriously, a great place! Went for my birthday last night and it was just amazing meal. My roommate woke up this morning and she thinks she dreamt of the gambas con ajo. Staff was super nice too. We had an 8:45 reservation and clearly had to call to say we'd be running late. We did have to wait maybe 15-20 minutes for table after that, but the food was WELL worth the wait. Every single dish we got was amazing. The mussels are divine, and you get a TON. Definitely go for the papas bravas and shrimp with garlic. Both excellent and good judges for a great tapas place! Escargot are also to die for. We also got peppers stuffed with cheese and a salad, both solid dishes. The bread is good, olive top notch, and really attentive staff. Also, really good/strong sangria! You can taste the brandy and the fruit is like a shot in each piece. Now I didn't see the bill, perks of the being the birthday girl, but my friends assured I didn't bankrupt them! I can't wait to go back and definitely want to check it out on Thursday or Saturday for the free flamenco show! I'd make a reservation if you're planning on going during the weekend before 9:30, it was packed when we showed up at 9:15 and there was a steady stream of people."
5584,7,5,1,12/14/2012,"A great place for music and dinner. The sangria was excellent. The tapas itself though, hit or miss, I would ask the waiter for recommendation next time."
5585,7,5,1,12/14/2012,"The ambiance was great, the food was tasty, and the service was excellent. ˜We tried the fried goat cheese on toast, patatas braves, albondigas, gambas al ajillo, sliced steak, and chorizo wrapped witth potato. ˜All of our choices were delicious. ˜We ended the meal with the coconut flan. We went on a Thursday evening and enjoyed a flamenco show while we ate with great music. ˜It reminded me of being in Spain. Our server, Unua, was so accommodating and friendly. ˜ We will definitely be back!"
5586,7,4,1,12/11/2012,"Get the blueberry pomegranate sangria, the octopus and the fried goat cheese."
5587,7,4,1,12/10/2012,"Food is great, been there twice. The Mussels are excellent with great sauce for dipping bread. Skip the sangria...I've had better."
5588,7,4,1,12/5/2012,Very good. Dan the owner is super friendly. ˜Thought it had a great group of patrons. Eclectic mix of people. Not too loud so we could carry on a conversation which we wanted. We tried a huge array of tapas. Only one we didn't care for and the owner took it off our bill despite us telling him it wasn't necessary. I'll be back.
5589,7,5,1,12/4/2012,"5 stars for the amazing staff and good food! We ordered 8 dishes for our table (2 dishes per person) and all of the dishes were good. Obviously some better than others. I loved the fried goat cheese, bacalao, and shrimp. More than anything the staff was very friendly and accommodating. After we finished our meal they didn't pressure us to leave which was really nice because a friend was visiting from out of town so it was great to catch up. Also get the sangria, you won't regret it!"
5590,7,5,1,11/28/2012,"I was very impressed by Nai. Their tapas selection is great, making it so hard to choose. I tried about 7 different tapas, all were good, but my favorites were the following: Fried goat cheese- Awesome goat cheese balls wrapped in jamon served on a tomato and toast cracker. Pure awesome. It works so incredibly well. Chorizo riojana- Think patatas bravas with chunks of chorizo mixed in. Whether it was a potato or the sausage, every bite made me so happy. Meatballs (albondiguillas estofadas)- Tasty and savory. These came in a delicious sauce which I had to dip the bread in. Seriously, prepare to soak it all up! The staff was great. ˜The manager came over a few times to check on our table, see how things were going. He was super friendly and even gave us complementary shots of some dessert liquor! ˜Which I didn't need- I was sufficiently buzzed off the mango sangria. ˜Watch out, it may taste like fruit juice but it must have a lot of alcohol masked in it. The tropical sangria is also good but the mango was just a tad better. There are also live flamenco shows twice a week. I'd love to check these out!"
5591,7,4,1,11/26/2012,"Great service, in particular Jenny behind the bar. Took the recommendations from some of the other reviews, the shrimp in garlic and the potatoes in aioli were really tasty. We finished off the with the meatballs which were pretty good as well. All in all, a relaxing and enjoyable experience on a Sunday night."
5592,7,5,1,11/23/2012,Great tapas place right near where I live. Everything we ordered was great except for the dessert. ˜ We especially loved the skirt steak and ordered a second round! ˜Make sure to book a reservation ahead of time for Fri or Sat dinner otherwise it gets quite packed! ˜Will def come back!
5593,7,4,1,11/22/2012,"I don't usually like tapas places because they're way too expensive and not all that worth it. This is an exception. Came here with a buddy to talk business, and asked the waiter to just give us his selection of his favorites. The guy was awesome, super friendly, really fast with the service, extremely considerate. Turns out that the tapas were REALLY freakin' good! We ordered another round at his choice, and it was also fantastic. Sadly I don't remember what they were, but I would totally bring friends here if they're in the mood for a little tapas action!"
5594,7,4,1,11/11/2012,"Went here for a friend's birthday dinner. ˜They had a good wine list including 4 different kinds of sangria - white, red, champagne, and blueberry pomegranate champagne. ˜There is also an extensive tapas menu, which come in bigger servings too. ˜For four people we ordered 6 tapas - along with the bread they give you - and that was the perfect amount of food. ˜The food was delicious, the favorites being a fried goat cheese, potatoes in a garlic alioli, and the skirt steak. For six plates of tapas and two pitchers of sangria we each paid $30 something, including tip - must more inexpensive than we were expecting! Plan on going back here very soon!"
5595,7,2,1,10/29/2012,"If I had reviewed Nai Tapas from the very beginning up until when our first plates came out, they would have gotten a 5. While the food was delicious, and the service started out great, I left incredibly disappointed. After our plates came out, our server didn't bother to come check on us at all. Apparently, the group next to us was much more important than my friend and I, since he was over there constantly. We wanted desert, but no one bothered to glance at us. We had to wave someone down for our bill. It was tempting to leave unnoticed. Both my friend and I are foodies and pay whatever it takes to have a great meal (we paid over $200 each at WD-50 the night before). We highly value customer service and therefore tip very generously. I left a small tip (because for some reason felt guilty not tipping at all) with a long note on the receipt expressing my disappointment. Too bad, it seemed nice."
5596,7,4,1,10/26/2012,Excellent time. My mom was visiting and she loves flamenco music and wine. it was perfect - we ordered the ox tailcroquetas de jamon and the calamari. Service was great!
5597,7,5,1,10/25/2012,"This was a great find, thanks to Yelp! Things I loved: The bar tender and manager were great! Amazing service. The live Flamenco show was really fun. I don't know how those guys can keep up that kind of energy. The garlic shrimp and the mussels in garlic, olive oil and white wine were amazing. Get them. Great date place for sure."
5598,7,4,1,10/24/2012,"I came here on a very random Tuesday night with a friend from out of town after reading reviews of it on Serious Eats and Yelp. Wow, did the restaurant live up to the hype! I had the following dishes: Mejillones R­as Baixas (galician style mussels in garlic, virgin olive oil and white wine) - AMAZING!! GET THIS, GET THIS! The mussels were cooked perfectly, but the sauce is the claim to fame. Make sure to ask for refills on your bread basket just to soak up all of the sauce and enjoy it deliciousness. ˜ Boquerones De Zumaia (imported basque anchovies) - Not the best, but an interesting flavor combination. Make sure you really like anchovies. Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika) - The octopus was a little too squishy for my taste, but had great flavor. Espÿrragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with a minced onion and pepper vinaigrette) - This was on the menu as white asparagus with a pink sauce (I think). Nice mild flavor and a good complement to the other dishes with major flavors. Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated with our spicy house tomato sauce) - The way I want all my potatoes to be - crispy and covered in a red sauce similar to hot sauce. Perfection. Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos (piquillo peppers stuffed with salted cod) - So good! That cod is no joke and the flavor was amazing. I took one star off because the service once our meal was over was a little slow, which was off considering it was a quiet Tuesday evening. Otherwise, amazing!"
5599,7,5,1,10/22/2012,"After having been to this restaurant for the sixth time since first trying it in May, I felt compelled to create a Yelp account and write a review. This food is delicious, the ambiance is great, the service and staff are fantastic, and the Sangria is amazing! This particular time ( and many times before) we got skirt steak, cheesy potatoes, roasted pepper and melted cheese on toast, tuna empanadas, beef empanadas, the ox tail stew (special of the day), and the lava cake. EVERYTHING was delicious and well prepared! In addition, we had the mango sangria which was perfect! I've also had a variety of their sangrias and they are all very good! Thank you again Nai Tapas for you very tasty food and your warm service! *GREAT for a group of people or a date!!"
5600,7,3,1,10/15/2012,"I love the champagne sangria here! ˜It's the perfect summer refresher. ˜I also really like their octopus, it is well seasoned and the texture is good. ˜I am not such a big fan of their cheese plate or their tortilla, both leave something to be desired. ˜The entertainment is great, just make sure you call ahead for reservations!"
5601,7,4,1,10/14/2012,"good tapas, great service, sangria was great, tapas where yummy, i recommend making reservations and its a good place for 2 folks to 10 folks. that is all."
5602,7,5,1,10/14/2012,"This place is amazing. Food was delicious. Especially the sangria (forgot the name) top notch! The boyfriend and I came early (didn't have to wait) sat outside. ˜The annoying part is that it's a small street so there was a bum bothering us during dinner (we were watching his spit making sure it doesnt land in our drinks) which made the experience a little :/. BUT the restaurant itself is small but fantastic, can't wait to come here again!"
5603,7,4,1,10/14/2012,Came here for the first time after reading all the reviews and after a few unsuccessful overbooked tapas bars in the area. Love the atmosphere smelled amazing as soon as I came in. The waitress was super sweet and accommodating. I started with the patatas bravas an croquetas de pollo with a pitcher of the champagne sangria!! One word...deeeeeelishhh. Had a few other tapas. While am over all satisfied the food didn't wow me! Think it would be a good spot to go to if I happen to be in the area not so much one for me to go out of my way to run to.
5604,7,5,1,10/10/2012,"great drinks, fantastic service, and mind blowing food. ˜I definitely would come back again!"
5605,7,5,1,10/5/2012,"This place is amazing. Delicious food, great service, reasonable prices."
5606,7,5,1,9/28/2012,"Generously accommodated our 13-person birthday party (with 2 weeks notice) Flamenco show was entertaining beyond expectation Service stood out as authentic Spanish - friendly, quick, not intrusive We never felt rushed to leave or clear out I recommend getting a dessert from the italian bakery next door if celebrating a birthday (they will bring it out and serve it as if you bought it there) Coming here will become a tradition! Highlights from the menu: Spicy clams Fried goat cheese Patatas bravas Gabas in garlic sauce Pomegranate champagne sangria"
5607,7,1,1,9/27/2012,"i'm just totally perplexed as to why this place is always crowded. worst tapas i've ever had. would expect this caliber of tapas at a mall in rural america, not in the middle of new york city. and that's being tough on mid-america malls. the bread they gave us was stale. the octopus tasted slimy and salty. the patatas bravas were basically Ore Ida hash brown potatoes doused in ketchup and wing sauce. the goat cheese was the only thing that was OK to eat and that's because you really can't eff up fried cheese. the service was great and they gave us a discount on sangria, as well as taking the octopus off our bill after we told them we didn't like it."
5608,7,4,1,9/23/2012,"I dine at tapas restaurants quite frequently, and I have to say that this is one of the better ones I've been to. Some quick tips: *The Patatas Alioli, which were potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce, and the mussels prepared in a paprika wine sauce were absolutely amazing. *Meat was very very flavorful. *The wait staff was outstanding. *The prices were very reasonable. *$20 sangria pitchers / $11 beer pitchers during happy hour. ˜How can you complain? Will DEFINITELY be coming back! ˜:)"
5609,7,5,1,9/20/2012,"5 - octopus. Subtle. Tender. Tasted like the ocean indeed. i highly recommend getting this since i haven't found octupus like this anywhere else. subtle - dont' expect strong flavors 5 - ham croquettes. Creamy delish 5 - goat cheese ball w Serrano ham wrapped around it. how can that not be good? 5 - escargot. Loaded w garlic and I'm sure gobs of butter. 4 - skirt steak. Perfectly cooked. Sauce was great, otherwise I make a similar delicious skirt steak at home so i prolly won't get again 4 - squid ink. Really good. I've had better at Tia Pol 4 - chorizo. good. not a must 4 - paella special. Of pasta not rice. must'be been craving carbs after the protein injection 4 - assorted charcuterie plate. I'm assuming this was good since Dave ate the whole thing and no one else got to try any. Thanks Dave. 4 - garlic shrimp. Have u tastes garlic shrimp before? That's what it tasted like. 2 - sangria. Couldn't taste any alcohol in it. fail No liquor license meaning only beer and wine would be my main complaint. Appreciated the service or free pitcher of beer and sangria at the end. everyone too bloated to finish it, but thank you guys!"
5610,7,5,1,9/18/2012,"We went here with a group of 11 , they were very accommodating . The sangria was flowing and the food was amazing. Definitely go if you want a good show and good food."
5611,7,3,1,9/16/2012,"Four stars for the food: ˜My friend and I ordered five tapas, and unfortunately I don't remember them but they were all very delicious. ˜So I expect it's like that for everything on their menu. The three stars is for the service. ˜It started out great, but they forgot about my party at the end. ˜There was a birthday party and what it seemed like a bachelorette party (there was a table of all women). ˜And our waiter completely forgot about us. ˜Which is sad because that soured our experience. We happen to catch part of the flamenco show, which was great. ˜But it can get pretty loud in there so I'd only go if I wanted a livelier atmosphere."
5612,7,5,1,9/12/2012,"I do not give out 5 star reviews easily. I have given out less than 10 while I have reviewed hundreds of businesses. This place has the rare distinction of deserving all 5 stars from me. Everything from the food to the service to the decor was just perfect. The gf and I had been on a weekend binge of popular restaurants around manhattan. The night before, we went to Sakagura. You can find my review of it elsewhere on Yelp. On the whole, Nai was definitely on par with if not better than Sakagura in terms of dining experience. In the past, I had tried to come around 6-8PM on a Saturday but the place was so packed that night I was told I had no chance of a seat without a reservation. In hindsight, it must have been flamenco night. This time, we got there at 6PM on a Monday and were, surprisingly, the first customers of the night. We sat outside and was tended to by Uno, who was a very friendly and helpful waiter. He made recommendations on sangrias and told us about the happy hour specials. $3 beers and $20 pitchers of sangria. $10 for a half pitcher. He had no qualms about moving our whole table inside when it got cold. The inside decor is all wood and dimly lit, creating a nice moody ambience with a rustic feel to it. There are barrels on the wall where the beer taps are. The place is actually quite large for a New York restaurant and you would never expect it looking in from the outside. The tables are also nicely spaced apart and you aren't cramped together like sardines like at most restaurants that try to maximize seats - and therefore profit - at the expense of customer comfort. People began coming in between 6 and 8 and the restaurant was very lively by the time our food came out. Churrasco - the steak was very flavorful and just chewy enough. The garlic sauce is amazing and you just want to spread it all over the bread and stuff your face with just that. Croquettes - we had the jamon and the bacalao, of which I preferred the jamon. It was the creamiest croquette I have ever had with a perfect crispy crust that offered vital contrast with the soft well-whipped filling. Pulpo de la gallega - the octopus by far was the best thing I had all night. So tender and full of natural ocean flavor. How long must they have massaged the octopus before cooking it? I could have eaten two plates of it. Definitely a rare find and the piece de resistance of this establishment. Squid in ink - very subtle flavor that is hard to find anywhere else. I soaked some bread in the ink and it was delicious. Patatas - I had the bravas and the alioli, of which I liked the bravas more. The patatas are cut into very small cubes almost like hash. The flavor gets in better that way. The bravas had a nice spicy and tangy red sauce smothering it. The alioli was good also but had a more subtle mayo flavor. The sangrias - we had the mango and the champagne pomegranate, of which I preferred the pomegranate because I like tangy drinks. The mango was also good except I didn't actually see mango as a component fruit in the drink so it's more likely that they used canned mango juice. In any case, both were good and I was feeling quite well after sharing two half pitchers with my gf who was completely inebriated at the end of our dinner. They also have a fine beer selection including Estrella, Mahou, and San Miguel which we took advantage of at $3 a pop during happy hour. The service, finally, was nothing short of impressive. Very attentive. Super friendly. Never intrusive. We were told we should definitely come back on Thurs and Sat for the flamenco show but to reserve a week in advance as it fills up quickly. The whole meal ended up running us a tab of $86 which is very reasonable for how much we stuffed ourselves. I added a $20 tip which made the total just north of a flat hundo. The sangrias at full price I would think were too much for what you get but I plan on coming here only during their amazing happy hour. Nai is my new favorite tapas place, better than both Pata Negra, La Boqueria, and even some of the arguably more authentic places in Spain itself."
5613,7,4,1,9/11/2012,"Our group of 3 walked in on a Thursday night around 7:30. They were fully booked but luckily we managed to get seating at the bar after 10 minutes. They have a Flamenco group performing on Thursday and Saturday nights (starts at 8:30pm) so I figured we got lucky. Space was small but not uncomfortable and once the sangria came out, the evening kicked off nicely. Food was mostly 4 stars. The 3 of us got 6 small plates to share: Mejillones Avoa (Mussels in paprika-wine sauce): Asking for more bread to soak up the mussel sauce is a good thing. We had to put in an effort not to fill ourselves with bread. The mussels were cooked just right . 4/5 Pelotillas de Queso de Cabra (Fried goat cheese over a slice of tomato & toast wrapped in imported Serrano ham): We really loved the slightly creamy texture to the goat cheese and the ham had good flavor to it. Came with 3 toasts so it was perfect for us to share. 4.5/5 Croqeutas de Cancalo (Salt cod croquettes): Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of seasoning. Came with 3 croquettes. 4/5 Patatas Bravas (Potatoes coated with spicy house tomato sauce): This is the only dish I didn't like. The potatoes had no texture and the spicy house tomato sauce tasted like buffalo wing sauce. I am surprised this dish got such lavish praises on yelp. 2/5 Churraso Arriero (Skirt steak saut?ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers): Better than I expected. The steak was cooked perfectly and the flavors worked well. 4/5 Chorizo Salteado con Cebolla (Spanish sausage saut?ed with onions): The chorizo had good flavor, that's all that matters. 4/5 In the middle of our meal, the flamenco show started. It was pretty entertaining. I found it pretty amazing that the two dancers and the musicians were performing in what must be the tiniest stage in NY. In general, I find most many tapas places overcharging for the amount of food they put out. The check for our 6 dishes and a sangria pitcher was $78 with t&t (that's $26 pp if your math sucks). For the quality of the food, service and entertainment, Nai Tapas Bar knocks it out of the park in terms of value."
5614,7,5,1,9/10/2012,"Hot, Steamy Flamenco dance show...waiter make lady happy...food make me happy...win"
5615,7,4,1,9/3/2012,Great food and good sangria! ˜Watch out for the old people that get pestered by big groups.
5616,7,2,1,9/2/2012,"Ratings: Food 1 out of 5 Ambiance 3 out of 5 Service 4 out of 5 Entertainment 3 out of 5 Overall the food kinda sucked. ˜Nothing really stood out and definitely not a meal I would go back for. ˜But on other fronts, it was good. ˜Service was very good (I just wish the food was better). ˜Towards the later half of our meal, there was live entertainment on their small ""stage"" towards the center of the restaurant. ˜The 2 ladies who were performing stomp their feet and clap their hands and dance around. ˜I am not doing a great job explaining this but it was entertaining and fun for the first 15-20 minutes but then it just got too loud and boring (overdone a bit, the show was too long, it's difficult to carry a conversation while this show is going on because it's so loud and long). I hate rating this place badly because they had such great service but sadly, they just dont hit the mark with the food and thats the whole point of going out to eat..."
5617,7,3,1,8/30/2012,"The service was the bomb. Our waiter recommended the octopus for us, so we got it. We ended up not not really liking it, so we didn't finish it. The waiter gave us a complimentary drink when he noticed we didn't eat much of it. The sangria was fine, but after an entire pitcher, I didn't feel remotely buzzed. Also, it was a little too sweet for my taste. I also tried the meatballs, but they were nothing out of the ordinary. Also, the fried peppers stuffed with cheese tasted just like that. They were okay, but they might have been better if they were made with a more spicy peppers, instead of a red pepper. The service was so great, I feel bad for not really wanting to go back because I have had better Spanish food in the city."
5618,7,2,1,8/29/2012,"This was the Friday night hotspot with very authentic Spanish tapas. Unfortunately the service was terrible and even though we had a reservation it took them forever to get us seated, get our drinks and even get our food. They were also out of a bunch of stuff which is a little more forgiving since we were there at like 10pm at night. Once the food finally came out it was pretty good though. We had stuffed red peppers, spicy potatoes, meatballs, etc. I thought the peppers and the meatballs were the best but overall I've had better tapas. It wasn't too expensive which made it worthwhile and was close to the karaoke bar we were going to so overall not a waste but I don't need to go back."
5619,7,5,1,8/26/2012,"This is really 4.5 stars - the only 'bad' thing I would say about this place is that the menu could be a bit more inventive. Its primarily Galician staples and they're done quite well at an excellent price (I realize I'm supposed to be complaining right now) and that's really great but I'd love to see a bit more unconventional stuff and that's not really their style. But what is their style is incredibly affordable, very well executed dishes served up by a highly competent and friendly staff. You can see why the 'complaining' portion was relatively short. We arrived 15 minutes before their kitchen closed on a Sat night and, despite informing us of that, which is entirely reasonable, they then went on to clean off a table for 6 and make it available to us in under 2 minutes. Like watching a nascar pit crew I tell you. Then they brought out dishes quickly and yet everything was clearly just made. Great beer selection including Estrella on tap which is exactly what I needed to go with my octopus, galician style. Will definitely be coming back here - good stuff."
5620,7,4,1,8/25/2012,"Fun, authentic, and absolutely perfect for any occasion. I am growing to be a big fan of tapas. I just love the format of sharing small plates with friends, so that you can try a great variety of different dishes. Add a pitcher or two of sangria (like the deliciously sweet and refreshing red sangria we had here), and you really can't go wrong with good food and good company. Some notable things I had here that I would recommend: - Gambas al ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce) - Serrano croquettes - Patatas bravas (in the red, slightly spicy tomato sauce) - Skirt steak with garlic and peppers - Chorizo with garlic and onions - Assorted jamon and cheese I also like that Nai offers most of their tapas in 2 different sizes, a small ""tapas"" size and a larger ""racion"" option, making it easy to order more or less depending on how many people are in your party. The service here is also stellar, amazing hospitality for a casual restaurant."
5621,7,4,1,8/24/2012,Great service and food!
5622,7,4,1,8/22/2012,"3.5 for the food; adding 0.5 for being affordable. The menu is quite Spanish. I spent 10 days in Spain, during Semana Santa, doing nothing but eating and partying. So I'm reasonably familiar with what the food tastes like there. I have to agree with a previous review that the food is fine but nothing special. I wouldn't stay here for hours spending tons of money sampling all kinds of tapas, like I did at Eslava in Sevilla, where the locals feasted. But, East Village is not Spain. Hence four stars. The bartender on Monday night ˜is super nice."
5623,7,4,1,8/20/2012,"The flamenco show was awesome! It was such a fun experience! The service was also really good and the staff are very attentive. I think salt-cod croquettas were definitely the best dish I had, followed by the mussells and then the stuffed peppers. Yum! The peppers took a little longer to come out but I think that's because they take extra care making them."
5624,7,3,1,8/16/2012,"I had wanted to go here for ages, and finally went last weekend for a date with my husband. ˜The restaurant inside is very tiny, and it looked like one of the only larger group tables was a high table (kind of annoying). ˜I was disappointed that the show wasn't on (we went on a Friday). The bartender and the waiter we had (Raul) were excellent - funny, quick, and everything else you could hope for in a waiter. I was let down by the food, and didn't think it was that flavorful in the end. ˜We had the squid, the anchovies, the croquetas, meatballs and the chorizo. ˜They were all fine but didn't really taste that good (I've lived in Spain as well). ˜The one thing I absolutely did enjoy was the tortilla .... delicious (but maybe a bit too eggy for the potato ratio). ˜ This would not be a good date restaurant while the show is going on, it was too loud and small and chaotic (we stopped by on Saturday to check it out). ˜ Inexpensive, but just OK."
5625,7,3,1,8/14/2012,"I came with a group of girls, which was great because they took reservations. I didn't come during the flamenco show so maybe that in itself is worth another star. The 3 stars is for the food - good but not anything more spectacular than other tapa restaurants. Make sure to get their pitcher of sangria- now THAT is delcious and worth coming for!"
5626,7,3,1,8/13/2012,"Not three stars but not quite four. I'd totally give this place a 3 1/2. A friend and I randomly decided to try Nai Tapas Bar on a Friday night as we were both not too hungry. I have to say, the best thing about this place was probably the service (who even says that about a place anymore?!?). The bartender who got us a table was really nice and our waiter was just the best. My friend was worried about getting a fruity sangria since she's not a huge fan of sweet drinks and our waiter was hilarious and so helpful. He told us a bit about each sangria and promised to give us a cheaper deal on our next 1/2 pitcher if we didn't like the mango. Of course....we loved it! Great sangria that's not too sweet! You have to go for the sangria! The food on the other hand....was just ok. I know it's tapas and so the portions are always small but I guess what we ordered was really small. We both enjoyed the food but it was nothing special. I actually really liked the Squid in Ink. So, on the whole, I'd go back to Nai but maybe just for the sangria and one or two tapas plates. It's a great atmosphere though."
5627,7,4,1,8/10/2012,"Awesome tapas, sangria, and service. First, the tapas. They were pretty legit and reasonably priced. We ordered the Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs), Chorizo a La Plancha (grilled Spanish sausage), Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), Almejas Diablo (clams in a spicy sauce), and Pollo Al Ajillo (chicken and potatoes in a garlic sauce). This came with unlimited bread that was crusty and perfect for dipping into the delicious sauces. The clams weren't really that spicy at all (which means something, because I have little to no tolerance for spicy food), which was great for me, but if you're expecting something smoking hot, prepare to be disappointed. The Gambas Al Ajillo were my favorite--large shrimp in garlicky goodness. Portion sizes were pretty decent. There were three of us and we were definitely full by the end of the meal. Secondly, the drinks. There are give or take six different flavors of sangria to choose from. One of my friends who had been here previously mentioned that the red and white wine based sangrias are dryer, the mango and tropical flavored sangrias are sweeter, and the champagne based sangrias are in the middle. They all sounded delicious, so we wanted to get a small sample of the mango flavored one to decide whether or not it was too sweet for us (it was). I expected them to give us a small cup to just take a sip--but no, our ˜awesome waiter brought us a giant glass to sample for free! Definitely a bonus. We ended up getting a pitcher of the champagne sangria, because it was happy hour and only $20. The pitcher special goes for the whole night, while the glass ($5) and half pitcher ($10) happy hour deals go until 7PM. Third, the service. I arrived a bit early for my reservations (which were pretty unnecessary, but I wanted my OpenTable points), so I sat at the bar waiting for my friends to come. The bartender was very friendly, explained the happy hour specials, and even gave me tips on what drinks to order or not. Our waiter was also so nice (and pretty easy on the eyes haha) and all the other servers made sure our glasses were always filled with sangria and our bread basket filled with bread. If you have questions, they are definitely patient and willing to explain everything on the menu. It was pretty empty when we went (6:30 on a Tuesday), so our food came pretty quickly. Might be a different story on a busier night. All in all, a solid experience. Reminded me of my weekend trip to Madrid when I studied abroad. I'll definitely be going back!"
5628,7,5,1,8/8/2012,"Great food. Great atmosphere and very nice waiter. I brought my boyfriend, which was from out of town, to this restaurant and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The bill didn't come out to be too bad either. And I came on a Friday night so I didn't see the dance show. Overall, I had a great time and recommend it to everyone."
5629,7,4,1,8/8/2012,"Great tapas experience! The tapas were fairly priced ($6 or so on average) and savory. Everything seemed authentic, from the chorizo to the clams. The sauces were particularly great - dip some bread in and you have a good top-off for your meal. Went around 7pm on a Tuesday, so the palce was fairly empty. The waiters were all great! They gave us an entire glass of sangria when we just wanted to to taste one flavor... we ended getting a pitcher for $20 happy hour, which was a pretty good deal. Seems like it would be a fun place to go back to at night for live music."
5630,7,4,1,8/7/2012,"Had no problems getting a reservation for a Monday night, and was pleasantly surprised to find they offer $20 pitchers of sangria on Mon-Wed! woooo Dining partner looooved the beef empanadas, and I do agree they were quite good. Also enjoyed the chorizo with onion and the clams in spicy sauce. Not such a fan of the gazpacho shot accompanying a toothpick with olives, beans, and anchovies - it was supposed to be a flavor explosion, but was kind of weird. Was pretty disappointed by the boiled octopus, which I found sooo textureless and flavorless, blech. Ended with the almond tart for dessert. It was decent, but I would rather have taken the money and gone to get dessert at Blackhound around the corner. Friendly and fast service. Interesting that they're still using a paper-based system to keep track of orders. Might come back for flamenco night to see what that's like~"
5631,7,3,1,7/30/2012,"I went here for my birthday dinner because it was under the ""good for groups"" category. ˜I also wanted some small eats we could share. ˜The food was delicious and this is probably one of the better tapas joints I've been too. The wait looked long but we had reservations and sat down very quickly. Unfortunately - I did not realize we were there for ""flamenco night."" ˜Unless you are there for the spectacle, I would avoid flamenco night. ˜ Sadly our table was literally against the small flamenco ""stage"" and the performers even bumped into my friend a few times. ˜It was SO loud we all lost our voices the next day. The flamenco dancing was beautiful & fun to watch... but I would avoid Nai on flamenco night if you are looking for a quiet spot to chat with friends. ˜Otherwise - the food was good and the people were friendly."
5632,7,5,1,7/29/2012,"Love this place! Make reservations, especially if you want a good table for the flamenco show. ˜Tapas were delicious. ˜Very close to what you'd find in Spain. ˜Highlights were: Pulpo - probably my favorite. tender, smokey and delicious Squid in ink jamon and machengo plate Grilled sardines Clams Our server was soo super sweet. ˜We bonded over Bilbao and his Basque background. ˜This is definitely a place I want to come back to."
5633,7,5,1,7/26/2012,"This place is FANTASTIC. I went twice in just the span of three days. The first time I went on a Saturday night with a group of friends. We just happened to stumble upon Nai and went in. Little did we know there was a live flamenco show going on! The show made the restaurant way too loud to have proper conversation, but the tapas made up for it. All of the food was great. That first night we had: -Squid in its own ink (FANTASTIC! Especially if you use the appetizer bread and dip it in the ink) -Caracoles (escargot in a sauce, this was great too) -Some kind of chorizo, which I didn't get to try -Beef empanadas (good) I went again with a friend on a Monday at around 5PM and the place was quieter. There was no flamenco show and there were a lot of free tables. This is the ideal time to go for someone like me, who doesn't enjoy very loud places. This time we had: -Bacalaitos (AWESOME!) -Beef empanadas -The squid in its own ink -Blood sausage (GREAT) -Some kind of potato dish (which I didn't try) Everything I've had here is so full of flavor and well cooked. It really makes me trust ˜them. But the best part? Their food is always served HOT! I'm the kind of person who needs all their food to be served at a very high temperature in order to enjoy it. I can't stand when something is served cold, or even when it's served warm. Everything I had at Nai was very hot, just the way I like it. The service was also great both times. We didn't have to wait too long for our food, and our waiters were very kind and attentive on both occasions. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I can't wait to return to try the rest of their dishes!"
5634,7,4,1,7/22/2012,"Great food, very nice establishment and beautiful."
5635,7,5,1,7/22/2012,"My new favorite restaurant in the entire city. I walk by this place every single day of my life on my way to work, and I have been tempted to try it for months because I am a lover of both tapas and flamenco. Today was finally the day to go, and I arrived at around 9:40pm, asking for a table for two. Little did I know that my lovely friend would make me wait for an entire hour and a half, but the staff was extremely gracious about the fact that they were basically losing money since my table could have gone to someone else in the meantime, instead of having me sitting there waiting... and waiting... and waiting... You guys have no idea how much I appreciate the fact that they were so nice about it and never tried to rush me. Anyway, when I decided that I had had enough of ogling at everyone else's food while my little table remained empty as I waited for my friend, I finally decided to order a few things. First, the gambas al ajillo, let me tell you, this is the number one reason why I wanted to go to a tapas place so badly today, I have been craving gambas for months, and these actually surpassed (by a loooootttt) all my expectations. In the end we (yes, my friend did eventually show up) ordered like three servings. We also had the croquetas de bacalao and pollo, and the pelotillas de queso de cabra with serrano ham. I am still not over how delicious every single thing was. Absolutely fantastic. The drinks are also amazing, the tinto de verano is pretty tasty, but then I had the mango sangr­a and I almost died. I still cannot believe how exquisite it is. On top of all that, the dessert was also perfect, the tarta de Santiago, beautifully balanced. Service was the absolute best, David and Andr?s became my pals tonight, and I am definitely looking forward to coming back much more frequently from now on. The ambiance and music were definitely my style, as I knew every song they played. And, let's please not forget, the flamenco show was yet another highlight of this wonderful experience. This is definitely a place I will be recommending to everyone I know."
5636,7,4,1,7/20/2012,"This is a cute space. ˜We sat at the bar, and the woman who was bartending was sweet and also pretty attentive considering how busy they were. ˜I had the patatas bravas, which were coated in a spicy tomato based sauce - absolutely delicious. ˜I also had the pimientos de piquillo rellenos with cheese, a breaded fried pimiento stuffed with a small amount of cheese served on toast. ˜That one was a little oily for my me, but tasted ok. ˜As a vegetarian, there were a few more options that I hope to try next time. ˜ We had the red sangria. Heaven have mercy. ˜It was sooooooooooooo good. I only chose to show some type of home training because I was in public, but if I'd been at home (or in the trust tree of friends only) I would have basically put a straw straight in the pitcher. ˜Pretty reasonably priced ($10 for both of my tapas) and they had a flamenco with live music accompaniment. ˜ Overall, a very pleasant experience. :)"
5637,7,5,1,7/11/2012,"Yet another reason I love NYC. ˜ Walking into a restaurant and being transported back to a memory or a far away land with authentic music and delicious foods. This cozy tapas bar is bookshelved by by beautiful brick walls. Behind the actual bar are kegs of wine for your sangria drinking pleasure. ˜(Side note for Filipinos: They carry San Miguel$6!!) . Service on a Saturday night at 10:30pm was so so. ˜Super friendly hostess directed us to the bar as we waited for our table. ˜Same lady turned out being our server as well since they were short handed that night. ˜She did it all. ˜We did have long waits in between being seated, ordering, and being served. ˜Fortunately the live music and Flamenco dancers were a fun distraction. ˜(Live Flamenco Live Flamenco shows on Saturdays at 7:30pm & 10:30pm). ˜Not to mention the pitchers of tasty sangria that kept flowing. ˜They come in all sizes: by the glass, the half pitcher, and whole pitcher. Very authentic menu. Actual Spanish people eat here. ˜That's a good sign you found a good tapas joint. ˜Tapas here reminded me of my trip to Madrid from years back. ˜ All the food had great flavor but was a bit inconsistent at times. ˜We ordered the Churrasco Arriero -$19(skirt steak saut?ed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers) and enjoyed it so much that we put in for another order. ˜Our second serving left us a bit unsatisfied, not as much flavor-as if the cooking process was rushed. ˜Tortilla Espanola (traditional Spanish omlet with onions & potatoes-$10) ˜is a must order as well as the olives stuffed with anchovies and potatoes. ˜ Final round up: 4 girls:4 half pitchers of sangria (try all their flavors, all delicious!) + about 8 plates of hot tapas = $40/girl including tax & tip."
5638,7,5,1,7/9/2012,"I was there last Sat at 7 pm. Our last 2 guests were running late but the host offered to seat us right away. The bread they gave us as we waited was nothing special. The crust was too hard. The olives were tasty though. When the full party has arrived, we ordered a whole bunch of tapas and as well as the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria. The sangria was excellent. Not too strong and really refreshing. I, personally, LOVED the Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus), the Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak), the Gambas Al Ajillo (shrimp in garlic sauce), and the Pan Tumaca (serrano ham and manchego cheese on toast). So delicious. We also ordered a pitcher of the red sangria- good but i preferred the blueberry. We ordered more food but the restaurant was so busy (don't know when it happened but all of a sudden I noticed it was packed) that we had to wait. And we waited what felt like an eternity. After inquiring about our food, our waiter Raul brought us brought us a free plate of tapas (i think the Patatas Alioli) as an apology for the delay. And then some time after that he brought us A FREE PITCHER OF SANGRIA. What? So awesome!! When we got our bill we thought they overcharged us so Raul very patiently explained each item to us. Not once, but twice. I was cringing inside but he was so friendly, nice, and helpful about it (turns out everything on the bill made sense, we weren't charged extra). We paid and as were leaving I waited for Raul to come clear the table. I asked for his name, thanked him, shook his hand, and gave him an extra bill- I was THAT impressed with the service. Without a doubt I am coming back here again. Oh and I can't believe I almost forgot about the flamenco dancers!! They were fantastic. It really helped create a fun and festive environment. Lol why bother travelling to Spain, j come to Nai Tapas Bar!!"
5639,7,5,1,7/8/2012,"OMG, what a gem. Didn't have a reservation but as I was really in the mood for Tapas, we showed up. David was accommodating although he was super busy running around. The food was great, but now that I look back, everything we ordered was fried, maybe that's why? The goat cheese with serrano ham on toast - yummy ! The kicker was the amazing flamenco dancers. Who would've guessed? Our waiter Raul was super attentive and that just added to the whole experience of a warm, cozy atmosphere. I'm sure the other spanish yelpers can comment much better on the food, but basically I have zero complaints and the bill in the end was another pleasant surprise. ""Nai"" simply turned a simple casual catchup dinner, into an amazing experience."
5640,7,5,1,7/5/2012,"Nai translates to ""mother"" in Galician. ˜As such, the images that come immediately to mind are those of my ""Spanish mother"", a woman with tremendous warmth who is always telling silly jokes, and treats me, her ""adopted daughter"", as one of her own. After being seated and looking at the menu, I was happy to see that food and beverages made me feel as though I was in Galicia again, possibly in the house of my Spanish mother. ˜I never imagined that I could order a clarita (a draft beer with La Casera - a brand of soda) or kalimotxo (a popular mixed drink of cheap red wine and Coca Cola) in the East Village. ˜AND there was Spanish wine by the glass, Estrella Damm on draft, and my favorite, Estrella Galicia, by the bottle. On this particular Monday, the bar special of the day was $20 for a large pitcher of sangria. ˜With five flavors available, we were unsure of which to order and requested a taste of mango sangria before committing to a whole pitcher. ˜Our waiter brought us a large glass (which he let us finish and did not charge us for!) and both of us were surprised to taste a sweet and refreshing white-wine based sangria, with lots of wine-soaked apples. As for the tapas, they are probably some of the best that I have had here in the United States (and for me to say this is quite a statement!). ˜Many of the recipes on the menu were passed down from Ana Maria Gonzalez Arias' grandmother, who hails from Galicia. You MUST order the pulpo a la gallega. ˜It is so tender and practically melted in my mouth (FYI: octopus should never have ""texture"" or be chewy). ˜When we asked the waiter about the recipe, he said the preparation is just as it is in Spain: the octopus is boiled briefly in water 3 or 4 times before the heat is lowered for it to cook normally. The albondigas were also fantastic. ˜A pork-beef combination is used for the meatball itself and everything is slowly cooked in a tomato-brandy sauce. ˜Be sure to use a slice of bread or two to enjoy more of the sauce! We also ordered a combination of croquetas de jamon and de bacalao. ˜The filling for the croquetas de jamon was perfect - not too runny or pasty. ˜Because bacalao is a very delicate fish, the flavors in those croquetas got a little ""lost"". ˜Although I preferred the croquetas de jamon because they were more savory, both were very enjoyable. The beauty of Spanish food is that sometimes the simplest ingredients and most basic preparations are some of the most enjoyable. ˜The bacalao frito, a preparation of cod fish lightly battered and fried and served with aioli sauce, was a perfect example of this. ˜The handful of ingredients used allowed us to appreciate how fresh the fish was. Last, but certainly not least, we shared a slice of brazo gitano for dessert. ˜Once again, I was flooded with memories of my Spanish mother who always makes a savory version of this sponge cake that can be filled with practically anything. ˜Nai's rendition of this traditional dessert used an almond-sugar filling and was drizzled with chocolate. ˜The sponge cake was perfectly moist, making this the perfect way to end the meal. Our waiter was extremely attentive and shared his enthusiasm for the menu with us over the course of dinner. ˜He also gave us additional information about the flamenco performances that take place on the weekend and told us he hoped we would return. ˜I am so happy to have found a place that brings back memories of Spain, while serving affordable food and drink in an atmosphere that makes me feel like family."
5641,7,4,1,7/4/2012,"I tried out this restaurant for the first time recently with a group of 5 friends. We were seated right away and ˜the service remained excellent through the entire meal. The waiter was friendly and attentive. We had the red wine sangria (pitcher for $20) which was tasty! We ordered about 6 ""racions"" aka the larger tapas. We all agreed that it was plenty of food. Each dish was better than the next, we got everything from the garlic shrimp to the skirt steak. At the end we were all surprised at the total of the bill, such a bargain! We will definitely be going back."
5642,7,4,1,7/3/2012,"Stopped by here for a quick bite to eat last night. We ordered a pitcher of champagne sangria (yum) which was on special for $20! We ordered the shrimp in green sauce, octopus (galician style), and the skirt steak sauteed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers. Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak) - Probably the best dish. Ours was cooked perfectly to medium and the meat was well flavored and tender. The sauce/garnish that came with was refreshing, and I loved the pickled cherry peppers. Pulpo A La Gallega (octopus) - Our server warned that it might be a little chewy...honestly it was a bit too soft! I feel like the texture was off and it smelled a bit too fishy. Maybe an off day for this dish, but definitely not up to par with other octopus tapas that I've had. Shrimp in green sauce - The sauce for this was delicious. We sopped up the whole thing with the bread they provided. Overall, the ambiance was nice. We sat outside because it wasn't too hot or humid, but the servers were very attentive and came out frequently to pour our champagne sangria, refill our water, and check up on us. I thought some of the dishes were a bit pricey compared to other tapas joints, but some of the vegetarian dishes were a bit cheaper. Evens out in the end. I would recommend coming here sometime Mon-Wed and taking advantage of the $20 pitcher!"
5643,7,5,1,7/3/2012,"Every once in a while, one of the show ponies from my stable of thoroughbreds wants edification that she's special. ˜So, I gotz ta do what I gotz ta do...take her for a deelish dinner. ˜ In this case, since she was Castillian, and since I've been to Spain multiple times, I took her to a legit tapas bar to impress her. - Decor/Ambience: Pretty packed and loud...but very fun. ˜I'm not a flamenco connoisseur, but it was def cool to watch. - Draaaanks: White sangria was kind of tart but the mango sagria was off the chains...drank waaaay too much (which is status quo on a date) - Fare: Tapas is ubiquitous in Spain and I'm always down for it in NYC...so we ordered: * beef empanadas * blood sausages * skirt steak sauteed with garlic * seasoned pork loin * potatoes in creamy garlic aioli sauce * potatoes in spicy tomato sauce * meat and cheese plate * spanish octopus Except for the pork loin (kinda salty), they were all fuckin deeelish. * As for dessert I didn't order any, I was already taking her home with me. ;)"
5644,7,4,1,7/2/2012,"Great food! Amazing service! Festive atmosphere! I dined here for my birthday and was super happy with the overall experience! Our server, Raul was fantastic and made sure we were happy all night! The place gets a little loud so don't expect to have an intimate convo when the flamenco dancing starts. BUT if you're looking for a fun spot for dinner with great good, Nai is your spot!"
5645,7,4,1,6/25/2012,"In my honest opinion, tapas are made for girls. That's why we've decided to venture here during our girls night out. It wasn't a spectacular experience but it was suitable for a catharsis. In terms of the food and drinks, here's what I had to say... Blueberry Pomegranate Sangria - First pitcher was not potent. Second pitcher hit the spot Churrasco Arriero (skirt steak sauteed with garlic and spicy cherry peppers) - Best dish but TOO well done, which made it chewy Lomo Adobado Con Pimientos Asados (seasoned pork loin with fresh roasted red peppers) - Definitely tender but lack of flavors. More gravy would be awesome Patatas Bravas (spicy potatoes gently coated with spicy house tomato sauce) - Perfectly seasoned with a mild kick. Sweetly done Patatas Alioli potatoes basted in a creamy garlic alioli sauce - Ultimately creamy but no garlic flavor. Tasted like plain mayo Mejillones Rias Baixas (galician style mussels in garlic, virgin olive oil and white wine) - Bland. Sand. Flat Pulpo A La Gallega (spanish octopus in virgin olive oil, sprinkled with sea salt and sweet paprika) - Nicely spiced but overcooked. A little texture would be great Esparragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with a minced onion and pepper vinaigrette) - Fancy but the sogginess killed the asparagus' taste With all the mentioned above, we still had room for dessert (which was what we were hoping for). This place is a little hard to find because we got misguided by the confusing Yelp (Google) map. However, the friendliness of the staff made up for it all. Will try to come back on a Thursday night to catch the live flamenco dance performance."
5646,7,4,1,6/25/2012,What to order: Red or Mango Sangria Beef Empanadas Blood Sausages Potatos in Garlic Aioli Sauace Meatballs Meat and cheese plate What not to order: Chicken and potatos Cod croquettes Garlic Shrimp Mussells Overall: Great friendly tapas spot. Lighting is semi bright contrary to other dark tapa places. The sangria is one of the best I ever had at a good price. The tapas are extremely tasty if you order the right ones. The flamingo drums during the weekends is very lively. It turns any boring date into an upbeat energetic dinner. The most notable thing about this place is the service. The staff is one of the friendliest I have ever seen and you feel right at home. I always over OVER tip at Nai.
5647,7,4,1,6/20/2012,"Went for a quick bite late on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised with the speed and quality of the food. Can't miss the albondigas and the fried goat cheese over bread with serrano ham. Delicious! Make sure the bread comes, because the sauces are all worth soaking up."
5648,7,5,1,6/18/2012,"I've already been here twice in a span of a week and a half, and there's a very good reason for that. I randomly stumbled upon this place one day, when I was walking around in the East Village. What initially caught my eye, was the sign for the live flamenco dancing on Thursday and Saturday nights. A group of my friends and I decided to try it out on Thursday night, and it certainly went above and beyond in exceeding our expectations. Our waiter, Raul, was not only polite and helpful but he was also quite patient while the six of us took our time in deciding what to order. In the meantime, he made sure that our glasses remained filled with their blueberry pomegranate sangria - a great choice out of their many flavors. Plates that are a MUST HAVE: Bacalao Frito, Chorizo A La Plancha, Patatas Alioli, Empanadillas De Carne, and the Pork Tenderloin (Spanish name escapes me)...to name a few. I could go on an on but I'll end here by saying this - if you're looking for a low key spot with an intense vibe, great service and even greater food...look no further. With a friendly staff and food at an affordable price (and amazing flamenco dancers/Spanish music on Thurs and Sat)....is it any wonder why all the reviews for Nai Tapas have been nothing but amazing?"
5649,7,5,1,6/8/2012,"We came (based on all the good yelp reviews), we saw (the flamenco dancing), we ate (everything!) and drank until we were merry (blueberry pomegranete champagne sangria hit the spot). It started out as a reservation for two on Thursday night. ˜One more joined, followed by another, and then another and another. ˜The staff were incredibly nice and kept helping us find more bar stools which was very much appreciated even though it was a packed house! ˜ ˜ Reminder to self: great date spot or for a lively evening to catch up with friends."
5650,7,5,1,6/6/2012,"Great service, delicious food and the sangria was perfect, not too much ice and just enough fruit! You MUST order: Gambas A La Plancha Aceitunas Rellenas Croquetas De Bacalao Croquetas De Jam›n Salpic›n De Marisco Pulpo Vinagreta Tabla De Quesos Y Embutidos Chorizo A La Plancha Tortilla Espa?ola Pinchos Morunos"
5651,7,5,1,6/5/2012,"The food here is delicious. ˜We ordered the following things and all were delicious. - Calamari in its own ink (very very delishious) - Empanadas - Blood Sausage - Anchovies - Garlic Shrimp Two types of sangria: - Pomegranate champagne sangria (delicious) - Red I would love to come here again, especially when they have the live dancing."
5652,7,4,1,6/1/2012,"I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. It was really good food, great service, and I liked the restaurant's vibe. The sangria options are great, but not as strong as I would hope for. Our experience was great here and it was also decently priced."
5653,7,5,1,6/1/2012,"I love this place!!! great food, the champagne sangria is amazing and the show is really awesome def going back :-)"
5654,7,4,1,5/28/2012,"Wonderful ambiance and food! ˜Tapas were VERY GENEROUS as compared to the size of standards tapas and delicious! ˜Highly recommend the squid cooked in it's own ink and papas alioli. ˜Call in beforehand to make reservations during flamenco timeslots (one at 8:30pm and another at 10:30pm on Saturday). ˜Not every table has a good view of the dance floor (which is why I rated this a 4 and not a 5), however the sound permeates throughout the restaurant (pretty loud). ˜Bon apetite and enjoy the show!!"
5655,7,4,1,5/28/2012,"came on a friday night. sat at the bar with friends and enjoyed some tapas and sangria. ˜The drinks were awesome. ˜We had a pitcher of pomegranate and a pitcher or mango. both equally delicious. ˜To compare them would be to compare apples to baby wolverines. ˜ The bartender was helpful when it came to which size we should order to things. The cheese and meat plate was yummy as all cheese and meat plates are, the olives were unimpressive. ˜The asparagus in pink sauce i won't order again. ˜It was blah. The potatoes were also meh. ˜ The shrimp and the octopus on the other hand were amazing! ˜I sooped up all the sauce with the bread! yum yum yum. we read that there was outside seating, but they said that they weren't seating it.... strange. hopefully next time. b/c the sangria begs to be enjoyed outside."
5656,7,3,1,5/28/2012,"Croquettes. Empanadas. Meatballs. SANGRIA!!!Etc!! Rustic, quaint, cozy. Service friendly and efficient! Enjoy :)"
5657,7,4,1,5/27/2012,Great service even on a busy weekend. They are an amazing staff not just one but the whole place. The food was pretty decent not the best but definitely not lacking.
5658,7,4,1,5/22/2012,I went on a Tuesday night and it was pretty quiet. The most friendly service I've ever encountered in the city. Reminded me of why we give tips in restaurants. The food was delicious. Order yourself the -bravas (not aioli unless you like garlic) -cheese and prosciutto combo (forgot the name) -croquettes -seared steak and you got yourself a delicious meal don't forget the Mango Sangrias CAUTION: Don't get the crab crepes they suggest you. It was absolutely terrible.
5659,7,4,1,5/21/2012,"Some great food, some stuff we didn't like-the calamari and seafood tasted like nothing. Someone in my group used the word Alpo. The empanadas and cod were amazing. My boyfriend wants to return just for them. Our waitress was extremely sweet and accommodating-even with our group of 7. Sangria was great, and they had mango and a pomegranate option. The flamenco show was good for something different, but became almost too loud ˜as we were seated right next to the stage. The price is great and came out to about 65 pp with a twenty percent tip. Glad I tried it out."
5660,7,5,1,5/16/2012,"I love this place! The sangria is magical, the food is very tasty and at a great price. The bartender was awesome to talk to as we were sitting at the bar drinking sangria and eating our tapas. Def worth sneaking in this cozy little joint!"
5661,7,2,1,5/12/2012,I really don't get the hype for this place. The ambiance is by no means exciting and the food really isn't all that spectacular.
5662,7,3,1,5/9/2012,"Came here for a bday with 3 friends on a Friday night, with a reservation. Place was crowded but not overly packed, but service was still really sub-par. It was on the later side, but still. - Out of most of the things we wanted - Took FOREVER to get drinks, service, etc. - Waiter acted like he was doing us a favor by seating us Food was good, not great. Portions were fine, not amazing. Price was so-so. Village-esque place in terms of layout/decor. Wouldn't refuse to go back, but def not on my list of fav places."
5663,7,5,1,5/9/2012,"I came here with 3 others on a Saturday evening without a reservation, about 7pm-so right about prime time. The staff did their best to accommodate us--since we weren't sure if we would be able to make it out before all the 8pm reservations, they let us sit together at the bar, and we still go to watch the Flamenco show! ˜That was a really special treat. The bartender was really nice to us, which I appreciated. I had the garlic shrimp which was just great--I LOVE garlic. My husband got the crab crepes. ˜I didn't have any sangria but I was impressed that they had a huge bin of fresh fruit right on the bar, she'd scoop some into a glass before tapping the sangria. So if you're into that--you really need to try this place."
5664,7,4,1,5/7/2012,"Really fun place! ˜Food is only 3 stars - good but nothing special. ˜However, the sangria and flamenco are really fun! ˜It's a good spot that's not too fancy but a great place to spend an evening. ˜There are also lots of great bars and dessert places nearby to walk to afterwards."
5665,7,4,1,5/6/2012,"The staff was really friendly! We got half a pitcher of mango sangria. It was delicious but a bit expensive for $16. But I learned that if you go Mon-Wed they have full pitchers for $20. The food was good. We ordered 4 dishes and dessert. Our favorite was the garlic potatoes. Next time, i want to get 5 plates of that. So delicious! The grilled chorizo was good. But I would not recommend the crab stuffed crepes or the pork cutlet dishes (sorry, i don't remember the exact names). We got the creme brulee to share and it was heavenly. I deducted a star because it was really loud in side. While I enjoyed the entertainment (a lot!) they could've turned the volume down just a tad. At the end of the meal we were stuffed and all for about $40! Overall, my bf and I enjoyed it and would go there again."
5666,7,3,1,5/4/2012,"This place is a solid 3 stars. If their sangria was a bit stronger and more natural tasting, I would be happy to bump the ratings up to a 4. Paul H. took me here to begin our night of feasting. We got some potata bravas, mussels, and croquettes. The food was really good ˜but it did take a little while to come out. I honestly think the waiter forgot one of our dishes and didn't bring it out until we reminded him. It's ok, he was really nice and helpful. The ambiance here is really fun and inviting. I noticed a band was setting up so they must have live music playing here on some nights."
5667,7,5,1,5/2/2012,Absolutely delicious. Great ambiance and can usually make reservations on the weekends.
5668,7,2,1,4/29/2012,"I think the only reason why I'm giving this place a 2-star rating is because I'm comparing Nai Tapas to the various tapas places I went to in Barcelona a month ago. Sorry, Nai Tapas. You're competing with the big boys here. For someone who hasn't had authentic tapas, I'm sure Nai Tapas would be perfectly adequate. They have a relatively wide menu, and tapas plates cost about $6 to $7. The dishes that I got, though, were quite lacking. I tried the beef empanadas, lightly fried codfish, jamon platter and blood sausage on toast. Everything came off to me as either old, or freezer-ed. The empanadas tasted like they came out of a box, the ham had an off taste to it, the codfish was a little overdone, and the blood sausage was served very in a very unwieldy fashion. The champagne sangria was good, though. Get that. It's happy hour up till 7 pm even on Fridays."
5669,7,3,1,4/26/2012,"I have mixed feelings. On the one hand, the venue was fun, they took (and fulfilled) a reservation, and they had good drinks (sangria, beer, the like). On the other, I didn't find the food mind-blowingly spectacular. For instance, the manchego/prosciutto platter was DELICIOUS and I kept going back for more. But the asparagus was mushy. Sure, it was out of season, but take it off the menu please? I could probably eat the patatas bravas for days, but the octopus was... mushy. Hmm... sensing a theme. Anyway, they still get 3 stars for the atmosphere (dark, loud, PARTY!) and for the fact that they take reservations. Definitely stashing it away in my list of places for groups!"
5670,7,4,1,4/22/2012,"Literally just finished eating here just 2 hours ago and I am so happy! Service was incredibly great; maybe it was the rain or maybe it was a Sunday night but the the wait staff was super attentive. ˜They provided great recommendations and the food came out quick. 1. Croquettas Bacalao - the best I have ever had. ˜Not overly salty or fishy taste. ˜So yum! I could have had all 3 to myself. 2. Gambas Al Ajilla - this dish was ok. ˜I have definitely had it better elsewhere in terms of how savory the sauce was. ˜But for a staple dish, it was definitely worth having. 3. Crepes with Crabmeat - could have skipped this dish 4. Grilled Chorizo - need I say more? Yum! 5. Jamon y Queso - generous portion of serrano ham and manchego cheese. a definite get. 6. Patatas Bravas - we asked for a side of alioli sauce and mixed it together for a heavenly flavor 7. Pork Tenderloin in Orange Sauce - very nice dish but was it wasnt memorable enough to have again. Great tapas place! Highly recommend anyone to try for a yummy meal with generous seating for you and your friends."
5671,7,4,1,4/22/2012,"Had no clue about this place, so thank you to the friend that introduced me to it! ˜At first I thought it wasn't going to be very good because their tapas list was a mile long. ˜They seriously have every variety of tapas under the sun and then some. ˜How can they possibly be good at making everything?? ˜But at least for the ones I got, they were good! ˜Now I'm intrigued by this flamenco night thing that everyone is raving abt."
5672,7,4,1,4/22/2012,"Good tapas and sangria, especially the meatballs and shrimp. The grilled octopus was too mushy for my taste. Service can be slow when the restaurant gets packed. Pretty inexpensive for the quality."
5673,7,4,1,4/21/2012,"I came here with a date who picked this place based on reviews and his love for tapas. After reading the Yelp! reviews I was really excited to try the food and the sangria here. First things first, the service here is GREAT and super accommodating. Even though my date was smart enough to make a reservation at 7:45pm, I was STILL late and showed up at 8:05pm. I blame the traffic on 10th street. The service staff was totally understanding and even joked around while walking us to our table, saying that it was my job to be fashionably late. (whew!) Next comes the sangria... we ordered a pitcher of red sangria to be split between the two of us. I've never seen such skillful pouring as demonstrated by our server. I took a quick peek at the fruit in the pitcher; mostly apples so I was a tad disappointed. Usually red sangrias have more variety of fruit, but it was incredibly delicious nonetheless. It was sweet without being too sweet. Tart without being too tart. As for the tapas, I had the following: 1) Pan Tumaca (toast with tomato, serrano ham, manchego cheese) 2) Espÿrragos Navarros (imported white asparagus with onion & pepper vinaigrette) 3) Gambas Al Ajillo (grilled shrimp in garlic sauce) 4) Pinchos Morunos (marinated grilled pork skewers) For dessert, we split the lava fudge cake a la mode. These four tapas, a desert, plus half a pitcher of sangria were enough to fill me up! I'd definitely come back here again for dates, with a friend, or even with a large group. When a group of 15-20 girls walked in the staff swiftly maneuvered a few tables around without disrupting the meals of other patrons. By the way, this place is a bit difficult to locate. It's located next to a bakery, and rather than being at sidewalk level, you have to walk down into the restaurant."
5674,7,3,1,4/20/2012,"The service and space are great but the food is just ok. Based on the food alone I'd give it 2 stars because nothing was memorable but the service was really excellent. The sangria was tasty but that's probably because they used grape juice. I'm a lightweight and it did nothing for me, even after 3 glasses."
5675,7,4,1,4/18/2012,Good food
5676,7,5,1,4/16/2012,"I've been coming here since the beginning and love it more every time I go ..the food is super tasty, the flamenco is tons of fun and the staff is friendly and attentive even when they are packed. champagne sangria is my drink of choice (although they ˜all are delish) and you can't go wrong with any of the tapas. ˜One of my favorite places to eat and drink in the city. :)"
5677,7,5,1,4/14/2012,"Awesome all around! Friendly staff, happy hour til 7pm and accommodates groups!! Food is delicious and the sangria is fabulous. Just a note to make sure your friends are not super late because on a friday night you have to give up your table after two hours (BUT they told us this at the beginning of dinner and still let us stay an extra 45 minutes since our group couldn't get our shit together). Such nice folks. I was really so impressed by this place, a new favorite!"
5678,7,4,1,4/13/2012,"3rd time's the charm at this happening place. Each time I attend, it gets busier and busier but RSVPS are still welcome (and encouraged!). ˜Going to keep this short since this is my 3rd update but came here for my bday dinner and the food and service was excellent as usual (read my prior reviews- I already wrote 2!). But, the new thing for me this time was the Flamenco dancing. ˜Ask for the exact times on Saturdays but the live music, band, singers, clappers, and the dancers made it for an authentic night out. ˜As a friend pointed out, these people are professional clappers (how do their hands not hurt from clapping to the beat?). Love this place. Great service as usual which only enhances the experience even further."
5679,7,5,1,4/9/2012,"What a great find this place is. ˜Our friends made early reservations for us, as we were attending a concert later. ˜A high chair for their baby was already in place when we arrived. ˜We ordered an extensive selection of tapas and larger portions, as well as a pitcher and a half of their terrific pomegranate champagne sangria. ˜The food came out in waves, so we would be finishing 1-2 items by the time the next round arrived. ˜Basically everything we ordered was a winner - meatballs, jamon, the usual tapas etc. -- all nicely done. The baby even ate some octopus! ˜The service was so attentive and thoughtful. ˜And we could not believe how tiny the bill was, considering everything we ordered - an incredible value for the money. ˜We left just as the Flamenco was being set up, so that entails a return trip. ˜All in all, a must the next time we are in the neighborhood."
5680,7,5,1,4/9/2012,"I made a reservation for my birthday 2 weeks prior and it was easy. ˜ I had a blast that night (past saturday). Waiters are very helpful, friendly and the Flamengo show is fantastic!! I can't find any bad thing about this restaurant - excellent service, delicious food, very reasonable price and wonderful performance!"
5681,7,4,1,4/8/2012,"I had one of the most pleasant dining experiences at Nai Tapas Bar. First off, let me rave about how awesome it is that a Tapas Bar in New York actually takes reservations.. (GASP! ˜Unheard of! ˜Do you know how many times I've waited 1 hour plus because tapas restaurants are usually super small and super happening?) ˜Then, a couple days before, I called to see if I could update my reservation from 8 to 10. ˜The person who answered the phone was so nice, friendly, and accommodating, it was refreshing to talk to them. Then, on the day of, the same person called me to confirm, but he did so in a very friendly and welcoming way. ˜I already felt like I was going to like this place a lot. And, it didn't disappoint. ˜The whole staff at Nai's was amazing. ˜They were patient with our huge group, and brought us drinks, bread, and really took good care of us. ˜We had an all ice cream cake, and although they didn't have a freezer, they were able to ask the bakery next door if they could use theirs. ˜We showed our appreciation by sharing some of our Chinatown Ice Cream Factory Lychee, Mango, and Black Sesame ice cream cake with them. The food was so good. ˜I highly recommend the ham croquettas, the mussels ( that sauce was amazing with bread), the steak, the heart of palm salad, the octopus (which had a creamy texture), chicken with potatoes, the sausage wrapped with potato, and the fried cod. ( YUMMMM ) For drinks, we had 2 pitchers of the Red Sangria, which was delicious. ˜They also had some drinks I had never tried before like beer with seven up, and red wine with coke. ˜Pretty interesting. On top of it, on Wed and Saturdays they have a guitarist playing Spanish music and a live Flamenco Show. ˜It was really entertaining and really added to the whole experience that night. ˜The dancers were passionate and it was a beautiful, emotional performance that we all really enjoyed. The restaurant itself is small, but I didn't feel cramped or crowded. ˜It was just loud enough to have a good ambiance, but not so loud that I couldn't hear my friends. ˜I highly recommend this place if you like Tapas."
5682,7,4,1,4/8/2012,"Great ambiance and food. Mango Sangria is a must. Some highlights include the Albondiguillas Estofadas (meatballs with brandy sauce), Crepes stuffed with crab meat, and Churrasco Arriero. The Churrasco Arriero was our favorite dish, the skirt steak was perfectly cooked and was accompanied by the most delicious sauce made of garlic and cherry peppers. Service was friendly and attentive. Make sure to make reservations for the live flamenco at 8:30 pm on Thursdays and Saturdays."
5683,7,4,1,4/8/2012,"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner early last weekend - we hadn't made a reservation, and we figured that it'd be easier to get a seat than later, when it gets a bit crowded. There were a few parties seated at 6 PM, but nothing too bad, so getting seated was a cinch. It's a bit dark in the interior, but getting one of the tables by the window was money - the natural lighting helps the mood quite a bit. Service was quick, and the tapas came out one by one, so we were never left pondering when the next dish was coming out. The food itself was delicious overall, although I wouldn't put the overall quality at a 5-star level. Certain dishes were extremely well-done; my favorites had to be the croquettes, which blended melt-in-your-mouth potatoes with succulent cod, and the mussels, which worked extremely well with the paprika sauce. It gave it a bit of a kick that a regular tomato-based broth for this dish wouldn't give, but it wasn't too spicy to overpower the other flavors. The cured meats with cheese was also delicious; I don't remember the exact meats or cheeses, but they were all very good. Unfortunately, the other dishes were a bit forgettable. I don't remember these as well, but the chicken meatballs were delicious and very tender as well. The crepes with crab meat sounds like an interesting and unique concept, but the crab meat was nowhere close to what you get in fresh crab cakes, and the sauce that was drizzled on top of the crepes didn't really do much for me. I've had delicious tortillas in Spain and at Soccorat, but the one here really didn't do much for me. It was too potato-y, and I didn't really get a good taste of the sausage (which was allegedly in the dish). This is a different style of tapas than I've had previously, but it was still pretty delicious overall. You probably can order 2-3 per person and have a meal worth sharing amongst everyone. I'd come back to try some of the other items; most of them are absolutely delicious, while some are just average."
5684,7,4,1,4/4/2012,"Food is yummy and the sangrias are divine. The wait staff is extremely helpful and awesome, honestly. They were so attentive and I experienced the best service."
5685,7,4,1,4/4/2012,"I went there on a Tuesday night, so no, there was no flamenco show, but its ok, I can always come back. Of course you gotta start off your meal with the most important thing, sangria. They had a few different types of sangria- red, white, mango, tropical, champagne etc. The waiter said that the most popular flavors were the red or mango. I ordered the red sangria. I wished it was sweeter and fruitier. Food wise, it was excellent. There are 2 sizes for the tapas: tapas and racion. Racion is bigger. For a table of 4 people, they recommended ordering either 4 racionnes or 6 tapas. We decided to do a combination. Espÿrragos Navarros - asparagus in olive oil, it was pretty good. Tortilla Vegetariana- delicious! Good size as well. Calamares Fritos - you can't really go wrong with deep fried calarami Patatas Bravas - I love this dish! Bacalao Frito - Deep fried cod fish. Each chunk wasn't that big, and you could dip it in some sauces that resembled tar tar sauce. Croquetas De Pollo - yummy. The waiters here are all Spanish and quite helpful. I forgot to mention that they give you a bread basket at the beginning of the meal but the bread was cold and chewy."
5686,7,4,1,3/31/2012,"I was really looking forward to checking out this spanish tapas restaurant, I've been slowly trying to hit up all the tapas restaurants in Manhattan. Nai tapas didn't disappoint, the waiters, mostly all spanish were very lively and provided a great service. I must say, the chicken and jamon croquetas were amazing, so were the chorrizo wraps and the aceitunas. The sangria was great, not as good as the one you can get back in Spain but it still made a great compliment to the dinner. Nai Tapas is great for any occasion, whether you are a big group or just on a date, they will be able to rapidly accomodate you. Great restaurant and highly recommended!"
5687,7,4,1,3/29/2012,"Mmmm tapas. This restaurant has a wonderful atmostphere. If you come for the live flamenco, take note that it gets loud. If you're near the action, you will be shouting at your date! That said, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Food and drink were fairly standard and nothing to write home about. Service was warm and swift. I'll return for the entertainment :)"
5688,7,3,1,3/29/2012,"I'm not sure why this place is getting such rave reviews. I came here last week with my boyfriend for a casual Thursday night dinner. We were seated right away and immediately ordered a wide selection of their tapas- meatballs, mussels, olives, some fried chicken monstrosity- and a large pitcher of sangria. Overall, the service was good and the ambiance was nice- but the food was mediocre at best. One of the mussels I had was rotten which totally threw me off. Nothing ruins a meal faster than rotten shellfish. Nai seems like its great for bar fare and sangria but not much else. The prices are great, but the food is not."
5689,7,5,1,3/28/2012,"This place is amazing for so many reasons, namely the Flamenco. A must do on Thursdays and Saturdays at 8:00PM. The show is the real deal and it never gets old. Wanna impress a date? Friends in town? Just want a classic unexpected NY experience? Make a reservation, AND get there early,they get packed for good reason. The food is decent--your standard tapas at a tapas price. But you're going for the Flamenco, it trumps everything. Beyond the show the staff is wonderful. Attentive, good energy, down to earth, most of them Spanish from Spain. Just go. You won't be disappointed."
5690,7,5,1,3/26/2012,"This place is fantastic. ˜I went here this past Friday with my friend from out of town and husband. ˜It was so tasty, the food was fresh, the manager/owner David was so friendly, and it was reasonably priced. ˜We had garlic potatoes, sausage, the omelet, shrimp, and squid. ˜So, so good! ˜I will be going back soon."
5691,7,4,1,3/26/2012,Really enjoyed myself! I'm allergic to shellfish but still felt there were plenty of yummy options. My group took a while to get behind the sharing bit cause we all really liked what we ordered. But highlights for me were the patatas bravas and the patatas in alioli (sp) as well as the meatballs in brandy sauce! Don't let them fool you into thinking the patatas bravas are hot- they were just tasty. I could have eaten just potatoes and meatballs and been perfectly happy. The drinks looked good too-though I wasn't partaking this particular evening. Service was very friendly and they described anything we had questions about as well as letting two of my friends try two different wines and then decide what they wanted. I feel like a lot of places don't do that anymore. We made a reservation so our party of 5 had no problems getting in. I'd suggest making one if you know you want to head there-it did fill up pretty quickly once we were seated around 730. Definitely seems like a later night dinner kind of place. I think it would be fun for a group or for a nice date!
5692,7,4,1,3/26/2012,"Interesting tapas options and an intimate setting. Water boy was almost too attentive, and the waiter kept bringing out more drinks even after we said we were all set. Thankfully he left those off the bill."
5693,7,4,1,3/25/2012,"Soo....Im kind of a hot head. We were running late with some out of town friends, about 30 mins late. By the time we arrived, they gave away our table.Totally understandable but as a hot head I didnt give the best face and was visibly annoyed. Even though I gave a complete sh*t face he managed to get us a table. WOW. That was above and beyond. I appreciated very much that he accommodated us even though he didnt have to. Definitely recommend. The food is great- my guest were veryyyy happy! Especially with the croquettes! The sangria couldve been stonger though... The flamenco show is great! in between they played some of my favs: Enrique Iglesias, Carlos Vives, Julieta Venegas, and Manu Chao. Overall I recommend, especially after putting up with ˜my sh*t face for being late to my own reservation! :)"
5694,7,4,1,3/25/2012,"This place is great. Great food, great drinks, and great service. On a Saturday night they also had great live music. This is up there as one of my favorites in the city now."
5695,7,5,1,3/23/2012,short and to the point. ˜Amazing experience. ˜Raul was great! Recommended several tapas and did not oversell. ˜Good atmosphere and had no wait. ˜Reservation was honored and would high endorse the experience!!
5696,7,5,1,3/22/2012,"Just go. You will not be sorry. I haven't been to a place that bent over backwards to make everyone happy like this maybe ever. We were a group of eight and they catered to our every whim + more. The food was incredible, they let me try wines until I found one that was perfect, sangria (esp red) was a huge hit! We were there on a Saturday night - live flamenco. I've been to many flamenco shows in Spain and these dancers were top notch and so passionate. Really incredible night - thanks so much!"
5697,7,4,1,3/20/2012,"The mango sangria is really good but might be a bit watered down. The most memorable dishes were the clams, mussels and meatballs. All of them were really good. Stay away from the octopus and asparagus. The octopus was slimy and the asparagus was soggy! Kinda gross."
5698,7,4,1,3/16/2012,"This place is very delicious, if you're in the area(and even if you're not) you should try it! I went with my friend and we split a pitcher of sangria, beef empanadas, pork skewers, calamari, mussels, and an almond tart. Everything was great. The waiters were friendly and attentive, and we ended up staying long after our meal was done to finish our sangria (and nobody was hovering over us to see if we were finished). The only reason I gave it a 4 as opposed to a 5 is because all of this together was $30 a person, and I don't think it was filling enough to be that much. But hey, everything else was great, and the sangria was especially delicious, so I'd say it was worth it in the end."
5699,7,4,1,3/14/2012,"Went to Nai after seeing good ˜Yelp reviews and craving tapas and sangria. ˜Went on a Tuesday night with three friends. ˜We ordered two or three small tapas each to share for the table and two pitchers of sangria, red and champagne. ˜Both sangrias weren't that great. ˜The champagne sangria was the worse of the two. ˜Both were too sweet, but at $20 a pitcher, I can deal. THE FOOD WAS SPECTACULAR and came in two rounds, which was nice. Croquettes, potatoes, tortilla espa?ola, calamari... Unreal. Gave it 4 stars for the overly sweet and watery (but $20!) sangria and because it was almost empty on a Tuesday, making the experience a little awkward. But I'd go back for the food. OMG."
5700,7,2,1,3/11/2012,"We had reservations for 10pm which was not honored. ˜We had to wait an hour before we realized we are not getting a table. ˜The host said he couldn't do anything about it, which was quite disappointing."
5701,7,4,1,3/11/2012,Funfunfun. Casual with great sangria. Yummy tapas. Felt like I was back in Spain. Flamenco dancers and music a bonus.
5702,7,4,1,3/11/2012,This is such a cute little spot. I didn't eat here so I can't review that area but I did drink here. There was a group of five of us. We came here and shared two pitchers of sangria. We got a regular flavor and blueberry sangria. It was amazing! The service was really good and it was so cheap. They also have free live entertainment. There is just one thing: this is not the place to come with a LARGE group. It's really small in here. I really want to come back here one day to try their food!
5703,7,4,1,3/7/2012,"Very impressive selection of great tapas. Great music, great sangria and moderate prices. ˜Oh, and live Flamenco on Thursdays and Saturdays. Everything you need from any tapas place, and mucho mas. Awesome."
5704,7,5,1,3/6/2012,"Nai's Tapas is an experience that you share with family and dear friends. The food is delicious, but the sangria and the hospitable atmosphere is what really makes this east side eatery a great experience. I have been here about 10+ times and I am treated wonderfully each time. The crew is very warm and they make sure your cup is full of sangria all the time! You have to treat yourself."
5705,7,5,1,3/5/2012,"I am in LOVE with Nai! The service is top notch and I have nothing bad whatsoever to say about them. Their tapas are cheap and delicious. I love that most of their tapas are only $5- $7, which means you can order a couple to try. I really recommend their Garlic Potatoes and Croquettes. Both of these dishes were my favorites of the night."
5706,7,5,1,3/4/2012,"Nai Tapas Bar is great, everything from the ambiance to the food. Pitchers of Sangria range from $16-20, depending on what you get and tastes amazing! The food comes tapas style - the small plates are about $6 on average and $10 for the larger plates. ˜Both of which are rather reasonable and very very tasty! The only bad part is the place is rather small, so if you do go you should make a reservation. ˜I went on a Wednesday night around 7 PM with no reservations and my friends and I had to wait a while. ˜Luckily there was some space at the bar for us to sit and wait. ˜We got a few appetizers there to start off before we got some seats. ˜The bar tender was very nice and very helpful. What's great is they do not try to push or rush you out, My friends and I were there for a while (maybe 4 hours) - ordering drinks and tapas!"
5707,7,4,1,3/3/2012,"I came here based off a colleague's recommendation. Decor: 3/5 -Not much seating. Seating capacity is around 50 Service: 3.5/5 -Friendly service. -Total wait time was 25 minutes for the bar -Due to reservations, walk-ins will need to be patient Food: 3/5 -Mejillones avoa: mussels in paprika wine sauce. My favorite dish of the night because of the light yet flavorful broth. You get between 20-30 small mussels. -Empanadillas de Cazue: beef turnovers. This reminded me of a Jamaican beef patty. You get two. -Tortilla Espanola: traditional Spanish omelet with onions & potatoes. Sadly the omelet was bland and needed Tabasco sauce. I also used the paprika wine sauce to add flavor to the omelet. -Pinchos Morunos: marinated grilled pork skewers. This was my second favorite dish. You get one skewer with five cubes of pork. The pork was borderline to being overcooked. Other than that, the marinade tasted great. I'm definitely coming back but I'm giving Nai 3.5 star for now."
5708,7,5,1,2/29/2012,"I can't say enough about my experience at Nai Tapas. A group of friends and I came here on Valentine's Day and the staff really went above and beyond to serve us. We were seated at a high top table, as most of the other tables in the back were taken by dates. Our server was laid back and knowledgeable and recommended how many and which tapas we should order. The food was delicious and everything came out right away. We ordered probably 20 different tapas and quite a few pitchers of white sangria. The standouts were the ham croquettes, the meatballs and the patatas bravas. I didn't eat any of the fish dishes, but apparently those were very good as well. However, what really stood out in my mind was that our waiter accidentally brought an extra tapa that we didn't order. We pointed out to him that we didn't order it and hadn't touched it yet, so he could just bring it back. He told us to keep the dish and that it was on the house. He then brought over a whole PITCHER of white sangria and told us that it was on the house as well to apologize for the mistake. The whole meal ended up costing around $35 dollars each with tip and alcohol! I have never seen this kind of service in New York, let alone in a restaurant that isn't incredibly upscale such as this. I would recommend Nai Tapas to any of my friends for it's good food, reasonable prices, laid back, unpretentious atmosphere and outstanding service."
5709,7,5,1,2/26/2012,"Amazing atmosphere... Went there for dinner w/ my boyfriend on a sat. nite. We had a reservation for 10.15pm and we got a cute table right next to the performers! I really enjoyed the show - the performers passion was almost touchable and it filled the small busy space! In terns of food, the seafood platter was great (octopus was amazing)! Other things, the shrimp in garlic sauce was great! Highly recommend this spot!"
5710,7,5,1,2/16/2012,"Best Spanish restaurant in NYC. Ambiance, Food, Hospitality, Food & Prices its all there. Make sure to go on flamenco nights, performance is amazing their selection of Spanish beers and food is right on the spot. I could go on writing about how good the place it is but you should go and experience it yourself!"
5711,7,4,1,2/15/2012,A pretty good place to go to for dates as well. Something I didn't know before (which I should have) is that they have live Flamenco on Thursdays and Saturdays.. Definitely a place to try
5712,7,4,1,2/12/2012,"The pros: - Not too crowded - easy to get reservations for Fri/Sat - Excellent ambiance - Great flamenco show - Meatballs and croquets were very good The cons: - The octopus was overcooked and very bland - Several items were not available on the menu - The dessert list consisted only of an almond tart and 2 types of ice cream in the middle of February... ˜the two cake options they did not have on hand (they did give us the almond tart for free, but it was pretty mediocre at best) Overall, I give the restaurant 4 starts because of the great atmosphere and great performers. ˜It's a fun place to go with a group of 4-8 or a birthday."
5713,7,3,1,2/8/2012,"Pretty good place for girls night dinner. Relatively empty at 7:30, but by 8:30 it was quite full. You can either choose to get tapas or racion (a normal portion). It was recommended you get 2-3 tapas a person. ˜I think it would even be safe to go with 3 tapas a person even. Nothing ""wowed"" me, they were all decent enough dishes though. One dish I would recommend skipping would be the escargot. ˜Never knew escargot could be bland, but it was here. Definitely order sangria. ˜Not sure if it is every night, or just Wednesdays, but it was $20 a pitcher. ˜$16 for half a pitcher. You do the math. Strongly recommend the blue pomegranite champagne one and strongly do NOT recommend the mango one. Service was really good. ˜Our waitress checked up on us quite a few times and walked into numerous heated debates about inappropriate subjects that we should not be having in a restaurant...but at least she cared!"
5714,7,5,1,2/3/2012,"Awesome little spot. I took my girl here for her birthday dinner and we both loved it. Granted, it was a Monday so the place wasn't packed, but that said: Service: 5/5: Excellent, warm, welcoming. The server took his time with us to explain dishes, make recommendations, and answer questions. ˜At one point they brought out an extra dish due to a miscommunication while ordering and when I mentioned it, they immediately apologized and said ti was on the house. Food: 5/5: Everything was flavorful and delicious. We had the - skirt steak: tender, good-sized portion - stewed meatballs: the meatballs and the brandy sauce were each great on their own, amazing together - white asparagus: very soft and tasty, but it only comes with 2 pieces - Spanish octopus in EVOO: AMAZING. They boil the octopus instead of grilling it, giving it a very soft, tender texture (like very tender abolone or scallop, instead of chewy like calamari). It melted like butter in your mouth. - mixed seafood in cider & olive oil: Good dish, but the octopus in this dish was more chewy and similar to the usual texture I expect from octopus - Red sangria: did the trick, was $20 for a pitcher (I think it was a special that night), they also have 4 other flavors Ambience: 4/5: One side has all exposed brick, representative of NYC. The other is painted with a Spanish-themes motif. ˜Multiple little tables with plenty of elbow room. Good music (mix of spanish guitar and various other sounds with Latin roots, I heard 3 Manu Chao songs during our dinner). Price: 4.5/5: ˜Not bad, as far as tapas go. All in all, a cute little tapas spot with great food, service, and atmosphere for a very reasonable price in a great location. Will definitely return, I had no complaints."
5715,7,4,1,1/31/2012,"Everything was delicious but I highly recommend the meatballs in brandy sauce. I could go on and on about the dishes but there's no point. Just go and order, you won't be sorry. The service was amazing...it's rare when I do a shout out on service, in fact, that's my biggest issue with restaurants, but Uno was so great I have to write about him. From making sure out water was filled, to checking in on us and having a charismatic energy and personality. We throughly enjoyed his service! I'm pretty sure the food could have been awful but we would have left happy because of him! But the combo of amazing tapas, $20 pitcher of sangria and excellent service made me a fan and a repeat patron."
5716,7,3,1,1/24/2012,"I really wish I could give Nai a half star, because it's right between 3 and 4! The atmosphere, drinks, and service are all great, but the food left something to be desired. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. Our waiter was super friendly and kept bringing us free pitchers of sangria."
5717,7,5,1,1/24/2012,"I came here on a Monday around 6, and the place was completely empty. Based on the high yelp reviews, we had been anticipating excellent food and service for weeks! We tried the patatas bravas (spicy and excellent), beef empanadillas (unique - had olives and raisins, very tasty), albondiguillas (delicous), cod croquetas (least favorite - good taste, but the filling was mushy), shrimp with garlic sauce (the bf said they were delicious, but I didn't try them), and grilled chorizo (pretty good). All servings are moderately-sized and well worth the money. We came during happy hour (lasts until 8?) and got a 1/2 pitcher of red sangria for $10. The half pitcher was about 4-5 (small-ish) wine glasses and very flavorful, though they don't soak their fruit in alcohol or wine before serving. I tasted :) The total for both of us before tip was $40. I will definitely be back!"
5718,7,3,1,1/24/2012,"Came here with a group of 7 people. Pluses: The space/ambiance was accommodating, the service was friendly, and our bill was extremely reasonable -- we ate a lot of tapas and drank a lot of sangria over two hours, and the total was under $40/person. Minuses: None of the tapas were particularly standout, and most were pretty meh. Also, most tapas came in plates of 6, which was awkward to share among 7 people. ˜Some restaurants will figure out a way to accomodate groups like ours in those circumstances, which would have been nice. ˜Lastly, the flamenco show went on *way* too long and was much too loud. It was fun for a the first few minutes, but we all had to leave after it went on 30 minutes -- conversation was impossible over the noise, our ears were ringing. And really, it's not that exciting to watch someone click their fingers and stomp around to a guitar for more than a song or two."
5719,7,5,1,1/23/2012,"Wow. We walked in and were lucky enough to get a table immediately even without a reservation. It turned out to be one of those amazing nights when everything went right. Nai had the perfect mix of atmosphere, great tastes, and great company. The had great unique and affordable tapas plates, decently cheap wine, and live dancing. My date and I split 5 dishes and a bottle of wine. We were both stuffed by the end of the meal. Two great dishes that I really enjoyed were the Octopus (grilled, not fried), and the meatballs. The service was amazing and very comfortable. The music and dancing can be quite loud, so it might not be the best place for a chatty dinner."
5720,7,5,1,1/21/2012,"Nai ay ay. Where do I begin with this place? ˜Maybe file this under ""Places I don't want to give a good review so people don't saturate it, but it'd be a crime not to""? ˜ The food is just traditional Spanish comfort food done correctly- light and fresh-tasting- no more, no less. ˜No crazy re-inventions, no pentagonal plates the size of half your table with a bite of food in the center, no molecular gastronomy. ˜But there's certainly a huge place in my heart for traditional food done right without smoke and lights. ˜The octopus (pulpo a la gallega) was the best I've had in an NYC Spanish restaurant; so tender, not chewy and well-seasoned. ˜The tortilla espan~ola was tasty but kinda dry. ˜We asked our waiter for some kind of sauce and he brought us an aioli and this amazingly refreshing and tasty tomato-based sauce. ˜Both just elevated the yum factor exponentiallly, so it would have been ideal if the dish came with these sauces to begin with. ˜The meatballs were great; so soft and tender. ˜The flavor of the meat was good, but elevated to ""PFFFF OMG WTF"" by spooning over they brandy sauce it come in. ˜The cod fish croquetas were spectacular; a soft fried volcano of cheesy deliciousness with the nice contrasting saltiness of the fish. ˜Finally, for dessert (which I usually skip but the prices are really good and figured the rest of the good was so good, might as well try it), got the tarta de santiago, which our Spanish waiter advertised as ""just like my mom made at home""....and well, all I can say is that I deeply envy our waiter's childhood food. My thing about NTB is that although the food is great, the most important that is that it reminds me of what dining out in NYC is supposed to be, but sadly (at least in my experiences) is not often enough the case. ˜So many times, in this crazy city, we get plowed into restaurants like herds of credit card-wielding, too lazy to cook, want to impress my date stupidheads. ˜So we go, are made to wait for a table despite having a reservation, get more of a forced grit of the teeth rather than a smile, get our food, shovel it down, pay and GTFO so the restaurant can repeat. ˜This has been so common for me that I stopped caring about eating out and took up cooking in earnest....until...until NTB made me believe in eating out in NYC again. ˜ The whole wait staff (incl. bus boys) was awesome. ˜It really felt like we had made a good six friends by the end of the night. ˜The flamenco music/dancing to which past reviewers have alluded is amazing and, on its own merit, worth going to NTB. ˜And then even when the performers are taking a break, the restaurant plays good Spanish rock (which, if you're not a fan, is like if GnR, Bon Jovi, etc. had Mexican cousins). ˜ And we were not even rushed in the slightest while we downed wine and chatted with the staff. ˜I have never raved on and on about my dining experience so much after a meal....so much that I'm pretty sure my girlfriend contemplated ditching me between 1st Avenue to Union Square just so I would finally STFU about it."
5721,7,5,1,1/19/2012,"Heck yes. Went here on a date and it was great. It was a little hidden, so it took a minute to find. Really glad we did though. Started off with an Estrella (because it was on tap, and it is a Spanish restaurant after all), then moved (begrudgingly) to sangria. It was really good, even though it is winter time. For dinner we shared several plates. We started off with a plate of assorted meats and cheeses (Una Tabla de Quesos Y Embutidos). These were varied and interesting, definitely a good place to start. Next we had the octopus (Pulpo A La Gallega), and it was stunning. The octopus was velvety, and perfectly seasoned. Get it! Last we had the meatballs (Albondiguillas Estofadas), and they were delicious. You are probably thinking, ""Meatballs? Really?"" But don't think, just do. The sauce was tasty (make sure you have some bread). I will definitely be back, hopefully on a night when they have flamenco."
5722,7,3,1,1/18/2012,"i was excited about nai and while they delivered on being a tapas bar, nothing really stood out as extraordinary. octopus salad was good - octopus was cooked more well done than i'd like but not rubbery. tomato, ham, and manchego bread met expectations little meatballs were perfect appetizer size, mediocre on taste patatas bravas were odd. ˜rather than the usual pepper sauce, the sauce tasted more like siracha."
5723,7,4,1,1/18/2012,"The service was excellent, the food was quite good (especially the mussels and chorizo with onions)... The mango sangria was deceptively light, but gave a nice buzz. Overall, I would go again!"
5724,7,5,1,1/18/2012,"Traditional tapas and red wine with a side of live flamenco? ˜Yes, please. I went to Nai Tapas with my date on Saturday night without a reservation, and was seated immediately. ˜Although the restaurant seems small from the outside (it's half underground), the space is sizable with many tables and quite a few bar seats. ˜The tapas were rich and flavorful morsels - my date's favorite was the grilled octopus in olive oil, and mine was the garlic sauteed shrimp. We were impressed with the long menu - many options came in smaller tapas servings ($5-10) and in larger portions as well (more like $10-15). ˜We were full and happy after 5 tapas-sized dishes and a bottle of wine. ˜The best part was the flamenco band in between courses (!)... I'm not sure if that's a weekly performance, but it definitely should be. ˜This is one of those places that's great for a date night but would also be fun for drinks and food with a larger group of friends."
5725,7,4,1,1/17/2012,We really enjoyed this restaurant. ˜The food was fresh and tasty and the service was excellent. ˜Our waiter made very good suggestions as to what and how much to order. ˜I would definitely go back.
5726,7,2,1,1/11/2012,"I recently dined at Nai with a large group (20+). Based on reviews, it seemed like the restaurant would be able to accomodate a large party without a problem. While the food was good, it took over 2 hours for us to receive a morsel. We tried the blueberry champagne sangria, and it tasted watered-down and funky. Maybe I caught them on a bad night? I'll have to go back to find out."
5727,7,5,1,1/10/2012,"I LOVE this place. EVERYONE IS NICE, THEY WELCOME YOU LIKE LONG LOST FRIENDS. Nai also has an excellent flamenco show. And everything on the menu is awesome. (They even did a few great vegetarian dishes just for my husband.) I will always return."
5728,7,5,1,1/9/2012,"Amazing food, great service, fun place to go. One of those places you stumble upon that will stick with you forever. The food is amazing and there is a great wine selection. They have live flamenco shows."
5729,7,4,1,1/7/2012,A delightful little place Came here for dinner with a few friends on a tuesday night. We were greeted by an extremely friendly and helpful waiter who took us through the menu in detail and made our life much simpler with the ordering. We started with a tasty mango sangria and moved to about 8-10 tapas style dishes. The food was great. Simple but great. My favorites were - pork meatballs - lobster crepes - chorizos - clams I really like this place. No BS. Just good food and good service. The bill came up to about 30-35$ per head.
5730,7,5,1,1/2/2012,"Went here on a Monday for dinner with my girlfriend. ˜We decided that we need to come back asap because it was that good! The service was impeccable - so friendly and attentive. The food was amazing. We had the mussels in the paprika sauce, the chicken in the garlic sauce, the octopus with sea salt and paprika and the shrimp in garlic sauce. ˜All were awesome! Nai Tapas is a go-to restaurant in Manhattan."
5731,7,5,1,12/31/2011,"We came here last year for new years and had an unbelievable time, so we decided to come back to the city and try Nai Tapas again. I asked the best waiter, Raul, for mineral water, but they didn't have it. No big deal. I just ordered water. Five minutes later he walks over with a bottle of mineral!!! They actually sent someone to the store to get me a bottle of pellegrino!!! Now THAT'S service! Everything we got(tortilla espa?ola, solomillo, chorizo alla plancha, pulpo, Almejas Nai, calamares, chipirones en su tinta, patatas bravas, pollo al ajillo, sherry, chocolate lava cake, cr?me br?l?e ice cream-actually cream catalana ice cream, espresso, cava) was absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!!! Btw there were seven of us. They actually did the 12 grapes at midnight, which is always hilarious( it's a Spanish tradition)! The flamenco show was fabulous! It was a perfect New Years! Love, love, love this place!"
5732,7,5,1,12/30/2011,"Fantastic tapas place! Really charming venue, really charming waiter (knows what he is talking about!), and the food was off the chain. MUST try the octopus. Really. It melts in your mouth.. soo delicious. Also, the croquetas with ham and the blood sausage are very well executed. I've been to tapas places where they charge twice as much for inferior food. This place has really got it right. The only negative thing I can say is that the sangrias were weak, but next time, I'll just order wine. Cannot wait to go back!"
5733,7,5,1,12/29/2011,"Great place, good food and ambiance, affordable prices."
5734,7,5,1,12/28/2011,If I had to sum it up in 1 word it would be SPECTACULAR! I loved the entire experience from the service to the decor to the food--nothing short of spectacular. I will definitely come back.
5735,7,3,1,12/24/2011,"Vrry friendly place and food is good. Not amazing, but tasty. Sangria made with champagne is very nice option for soething different. Excelleny bread with olive oil. Best dish we had was chorizio wrapped in a thin potatoe wrap. All in all a fine place to go. ˜comfortable. But not the finest tapas in theworld either. Extra credit for great welcoming service."
5736,7,5,1,12/21/2011,"I came here to celebrate my birthday and was absolutely blown away the level of service and attention provided to me and my group. The owner not only provided free sangria for the table, he also ensured that the birthday people had a flamenco lesson with the dancers! The food was quite good as well - generous sized portions that were reasonably priced. Some dishes were better than others - the choriza a la sidra was delicious, the tortilla espanola should be skipped. Overall, a wonderful birthday celebration and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others given the level of service provided."
5737,7,4,1,12/14/2011,"This place was good, but I was very excited after seeing the 4.5* on Yelp, and not quite sure it lived up to the hype. I arrived a little before my lady friend, and was seated right away, even without my full party (pleasant surprise after reading about everyone's horrible experiences with having to wait to be seated). I was there early-ish on a Friday, but the place was pretty packed and had a nice vibe. Wait staff was friendly, and recommended a blueberry pomegranate sangria pitcher. This was pretty good, but nothing too exciting. The food menu is pretty extensive, and everything comes in a ""small"" or ""large"" portion. The ""small"" portions truely are small, but still great if you want to try a bunch of different things. Prices are right too. Food highlights were: -spanish octopus in oil with salt and paprika. This was cooked to perfection -clams in spicy creole sauce -blanched white asparagus -meatballs I also tried the patatas bravas after reading the rave reviews. can't say it was anything special (my dining companion described it as tasting like tater tots with hot sauce), but for the $4 price I cant really complain. Overall it was a fun night out, but not the best tapas I've had in the city (still a toss up between Las Ramblas and Alta)"
5738,7,5,1,12/12/2011,"We read the reviews and decided to give it a try. We couldn't find any photos online from the restaurant and didn't know what to expect. It is a very nice, rustic and low key restaurant, quite small, with a bar. The food was excellent and authentic. The service was very friendly, attentive and accommodating. They really took good care of us. The champagne sangria.... Delicious! It was just what we needed. The flamenco at the end of the meal was a treat. We are looking forward to our next visit."
5739,7,5,1,12/6/2011,"Five stars for exceeding expectations! The tapas were delectable and affordable and promptly delivered (we were in a rush). The service was friendly and warm--like we were regulars, even though it was our first visit. The sangria was just the thing to loosen us up after a long day at work before going to a concert at Webster Hall. Very pleased with this find, and looking forward to going back."
5740,7,3,1,12/6/2011,"Nai's easily rises to that top echelon of east village tapas restaurants. Delicious sangria to start, a boundless medley of dishes of for all tastes, and live flamenco and music right in the center of the restaurant. Our favorites were the champagne sangria, the pork meatballs and the potatoes with chorizo. We had a few dishes with anchovies or sardines on bread that were hit or miss, so I'd err on the side of red meats next time. Our servers were also attentive and accommodating throughout (with the exception of an unfortunate spill onto one of our guests). HOWEVER, waiting over an hour with a reservation is simply too long. Our reservation was at 10, and we still hadn't received our food by midnight. It's tough to be too angry at the staff here due to their friendliness, but these are the facts, plain and simple. Our party of 14 was obscenely hungry and moderately bitter by the time our food came. Maybe they're less crowded on weeknights? I don't think I'll go back on a weekend."
5741,7,5,1,12/5/2011,"Normally I get pretty antsy when there's a long wait & I have a reservation, but Nai had such great service, food, atmosphere, and Sangria... that those anxious feelings were quelled. First off, I've learned not to get angry when you have to wait for a rezzie, b/c while you can argue that a restaurant should understand its turnover when seating & taking reservations... you have to remember in smaller joints like this you have no idea how your clientele is going to be on any given night. ˜When we got there for our 8:45 pm reservation, there were lingerers. Lingerers my friends are the enemy. ˜Those people that sit at a table long after the check has been paid and those painful minutes tick on by while they occupy space without bringing about any business for the restaurant as well as preventing them from seating new business. Don't fault a place for that... it's not like they can go over and be like beat it. Anyhow, that's what happened to us which is why we sat at the bar for a few drinks (complimentary of Nai) while waiting for our table to free up. ˜Needless to say, everything from the bartender, to the servers were great. They were very friendly and acknowledged the wait by apologizing profusely. On to the food/drinks. YUM! We tried two different types of Sangria, the Pomegranate and the red wine. ˜I preferred the red wine b/c it had more of a kick and I'm not into sweet drinks but the Pomegranate was still very fresh. ˜I love tapas and especially if the menu is authentic enough that you make funny slurring noises when you try to pronounce the dishes after a few glasses of sangria that you finally resort to pointing to the menu. Here's the ranking of the dishes we tried with 1 being the highest: 1.Albondiguillas Estofada - meatballs were deliciously seasoned and tender. They were actually the last dish we had, and by that time I was so absurdly full but made room for them 2. Pulpo A La Gallega - octupus. Yummmm and tender 3.Espÿrragos Navarros - great flavor and refreshing asparagus 4/5 Empanadillas De Carne & Patatas Alioli - i can't help but love empandas & potatoes! The potatoes were unlike anything I've ever had... creamy garlic 6.Pimientos De Piquillo Rellenos - I don't really know when I'm ranking this 6...I remember enjoying it but since it didn't leave an impression like the former 5... I have to put it here. But don't let that keep you away! 7. Blood sausage - my bf loved it, but just not my taste. I was expecting a spicier sausage but the sauce made it sort of sweet (which isn't necessarily bad) 8.Crepes De Txangurro - this was really the only thing I really didn't care for...the crab was more of a cream cheesy texture making this almost like a fishy dessert"
5742,7,4,1,12/5/2011,"Fact of the day: Sangria means ""bloody"" in Spanish! We wanted to get a drink and a bite before an early concert in the East Village, so we let the yelpers guide our decision... and we were led to Nai. ˜It was an excellent choice. We let the waiter (who might also be the owner?) choose our tapas plates. ˜He urgently insisted that we get the octopus, it's his favorite. ˜And we had some clams in house sauce, and fried cod crostinis. The house sauce wasn't thrilling, so I wasn't crazy about the clams plate, but the octopus was pretty awesome, and the crostinis were delicious. All of this pales next to the sangria though... They make a big vat of sliced up fruit every day and then the mix a ladle-full of the fruit with your choice of red or white wine. ˜We had a pitcher of red first (because the waiter/owner said it was best) and then we had another pitcher of white. ˜Hehe. ˜It was yummy. ˜BOTH were yummy, but if you want some authenticity, go for red... after all, red is more ""bloody."""
5743,7,4,1,11/23/2011,Best octopus I've had!!! U need to make a reservation a week or 2 in advance for more then 3 ppl on thurs and sat cause of flamenco!! But usually go with my gf and get a set at the bar!!! Service is great and so is the food
5744,7,4,1,11/23/2011,"Their sangria is delicious but not strong enough. ˜I had almost a full pitcher and was barely buzzed. ˜I went there for a dinner party and they were accommodating and nice. The host was nice too except when he asked if we included a tip when we were paying for our food, which I think was rude. I hate when waiters (or in this case: host) ask or demand a tip! Dude, I've been to restaurants before I know I have to tip! Don't ask me for it. We order almost all the ""tapas"" (and raciones) on the menu. ˜I think some of them were a bit overpriced for their size. ˜I recommend the shrimp in garlic sauce, croquetas de pollo (these were delicious), mejillones avoa (mussels), albondigas, and the fried calamari. We had cheesecake and the chocolate lava cake for dessert. They were both average. Nothing special. I am a huge flamenco lover and was looking forward to their Saturday show. ˜The flamenco show was a bit disappointing. The dancers and singers were good, but they took long breaks. ˜It's supposed to go from 8:30-11:00PM and I think we only heard 4 songs. ˜Plus it was very difficult to see, listen, and enjoy the show. ˜This was probably due to the lack of space available and the setting of the tables. ˜ They are good at handling reservations and accommodating large groups. ˜So i definitely recommend that. ˜The ambiance is perfect. I did feel like I was in some Tapas Bar/Restaurant in Spain!"
5745,7,5,1,11/20/2011,"Went with a large group (had a reservation) and the service was excellent. ˜It has a quaint, cozy feel. ˜The staff was very friendly. ˜The food was delicious! ˜Sangria very good. ˜The flamenco show was a nice touch. ˜Excellent place, would definitely go back."
5746,7,4,1,11/19/2011,"It would have been 5 stars if we didn't have to wait a half hour after our 10:45 pm reservation to be seated. It was a Friday, and the place was packed. ˜I felt forgotten while sitting at the bar (we were lucky that a couple left a few minutes after we got there). We had to approach the host after awhile to make sure he remembered we were there. But the food. ˜Ahhh...finally, Spanish tapas. ˜Only thing their menu lacked was foie. ˜You have a choice of tapas (small portion) and raciones (large portion). My faves: Boquerones- vinegary anchovies and minced garlic on toast. Ordered twice. Love. Aceitunas-olives stuffed with anchovy Bacalao frito-the dipping sauce was really good Mejillones Avoa-mussels in a paprika broth. After the mussels were gone, I used an empty shell to slurp up the remaining liquid. Mmmmm. Amor. Chocolate lava cake-very delicate, almost perfect. ˜Needed more. Mango and red sangria-wanted the mango, and it was very good. Sweet and very fruity. ˜I then ordered the red to save face after ordering a mango 'sangria'. The red was pretty damn good as well. Not my faves: Morcilla-Not a fan of blood sausage. My guy liked it though. Sardinas a la plancha-large whole sardines on toast. I'm more a fan of fish fillets. And this was another one my guy really liked so... Lomo adobado-pork loin and roasted peppers with bread. ˜It was ok. Nothing exciting about it. Raul, our waiter was very attentive and helpful in giving suggestions (He's Basque btw). Can't wait to go back and try some of their other stuff."
5747,7,4,1,11/18/2011,"Great, great food. ˜All the tapas I had were fantastic and I tried almost everything on the menu. ˜I went on a wed/thurs and there was a band (father and son) who played really good Spanish music and two women who danced to the rhythm. ˜Went with a group of friends and enjoyed the night. ˜Good sangria, too!"
5748,7,4,1,11/16/2011,Great ambiance!! Dancers and singers!! Wonderful wait staff and delish food!!
5749,7,5,1,11/14/2011,"Nai is one of those places I'm really surprised I haven't heard raves about just yet. It's a quaint tapas bar inconspicuously tucked into the East Village, whose open doors show a cozy cellar bar where people are happily enjoying pitchers of sangria and munching on tables full of tapas. Came on a Friday night, on a whim after walking by. We were rather impressed by the service. It was crowded in there, but they were able to seat us within 10 minutes. Our waiter suggested the mango sangria, which was served to us probably less than two minutes later, and very clearly did not disappoint. What I liked most about the sangria was that you could order it by the glass, half pitcher( $16) or full pitcher. The sangria was a slightly sweet, wonderfully boozy golden liquid speckled with fresh apples and oranges. It pretty much made my night. Moving on, the other reason that I'm dolling out one of my 5 stars is because this is one of the few tapas bars that don't make you fall into the dreaded ""tapas trap"". You know what I'm talking about- those silly tapas bars that charge $10 for a plate that require a magnifying glass to see your food and call them selves cheap eats, when you end up spending an arm and a leg to fill yourself up. Nai is not one of these places. Their dishes come in small and large portions, with the small plates running around $6 and the large running about $11-15. They also serve you a ton of super fresh bread, so our twosome was happy with sharing 4 small plates and it didn't break the bank. The food is also rather noteworthy. Their tapas are Spanish, and done well; a rarity in this city. The mejalones avos (mussels in a paprika wine sauce) were wonderfully fresh and sitting in a salty paprika broth. The patatas bravas (potatoes) were awesome and the white asparagus no joke melted in my freaking mouth. Also noteable were the pimientos ala morue, red peppers stuffed with cod and pan fried, served on small slices of crispy bread. This place is just legit. The service is great, the food is fantastic and exceptionally affordable. I'm excited to go back and munch on more of their eats, and especially excited to sample more of their sangria."
5750,7,4,1,11/9/2011,"Good food, great service in a nice space. Wine selection was inexpensive and good. give it a shot!"
5751,7,5,1,11/5/2011,"WOW!! ˜Phenomenal tapas & sangria!! ˜Love that this place is great for groups and takes reservations. ˜Came here Friday night for a birthday dinner and just fell in love with the food. ˜We were party of six and practically ordered almost the entire menu list. Top favorites were the Mejillones Avoa, Croquetas De Pollo, and Bacalao Frito. ˜We lost count how many pitchers of sangria we had - it was simply refreshing and delicious! Service and our waiter were friendly, attentive, & so accommodating. ˜Thank you for a fabulous dining experience. ˜Definitely welcomes you back and I will be back!"
5752,7,5,1,10/21/2011,"I can't enough of this restaurant! The staff is always nice and welcoming, the manager always visits your table to make sure that everything is alright and the best part of it THE FOOD. You will never be disapointed. The mix of the Spanish music and the excellent food and drink (did I mention how awesome was the Mango Sangria) will make your experience unforgettable. Will go back there at least on weekly basis."
5753,7,4,1,10/20/2011,"I met a friend here recently, and overall it was a great experience. Amazing blueberry champagne sangria ($20 pitcher on a Tuesday) and friendly service. My only complaint was that there weren't many vegetarian-friendly options. In a place where you order multiple things for the table to share, its nice to have plenty of options for everyone. I do eat some seafood on occasion, so that gave me a few extra choices. We had the potatoes with spicy tomato sauce, calamari, one of the salads, some pork dish (not for me, obvi), and crabmeat crepes (too fishy). We were too full to finish everything! I've heard there are flamenco dancers some nights - I'd love to come back then for another pitcher of sangria!"
5754,7,5,1,10/17/2011,"Came here twice for the flamenco show and it was amazing!!! The staff and delicious pitchers of sangria def will put you u in a great mood! The food was good, but def not as memorable as the show or the sangria! ;)"
5755,7,4,1,10/13/2011,"LOve it ! Food is delicioso !!! I never ever in my life had such a tasty aceitunas (olives). Sangria is fruity and refreshing ( I had white mango sangria ) Music is authentic Spanish ( not Latin ) Service is great ( handsome spanish macho , who will help to satisfy any of your culinary desires fast and promptly ) Decor is nice and inviting . Only issue I have - that tables are to wide , so to be able to hear your companion you must seat on same side of table , not in front of each other . Prices are good also )"
5756,7,5,1,10/9/2011,"Offers a phenomenal (and phenomenally delicious) selection of Spanish tapas as well as multiple flavors of sangria. They even did a live Flamenco show right next to our table! It wasn't too pricey, either. For our group of 7, the total came out to $21/person, sangria included. It was a bit loud, but I think that the atmosphere is designed to cater to larger groups. Go with 6+ people, and expect to have a great time!"
5757,7,2,1,10/1/2011,"I sooo wanted to like Nai. ˜The atmosphere is so lively & the host & waiter were really lovely, but I didn't enjoy my meal one bit. I started the evening with tropical sangria, which I did not enjoy. I shared four tapas - salpicon de mariscos, crabmeat crepes, mussels, & patatas bravas. ˜ The salpicon dish had a few shrimp, 2 or 3 mussels, a scallop that was sliced into 3 pieces, & a few pieces of octopus over a mound of chopped tomatoes & red & green peppers. ˜This annoyed me because: 1) there was not nearly enough seafood to warrant the $18 price tag 2) the dish was completely devoid of any flavor 3) the description didn't say the grilled (i.e., hot) seafood came with cold chopped veg. ˜Had I known that, I would not have ordered it. ˜I f-cking hate green peppers & I don't order tomatoes out because I hate getting stuck with the mealy variety that are white inside. The crabmeat crepes had a strange taste & texture - not terrible, but strange. The mussels tasted ok, but they were sooo tiny. ˜ The patatas had a sauce that tasted like cooked ketchup & vinegar. My waiter asked at least twice if my friend & I enjoyed our meal. ˜He seemed so nice that I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't. ˜It's because of the friendly staff that I don't have the heart to give Nai the 1 star that my meal deserved. Most of the reviews for Nai are so positive - did I order every bad plate on the menu? =("
5758,7,4,1,9/26/2011,"Having spent a while in Spain, I was pleased with this place. The dishes had quite authentic flavours (nice, but simple) and the service was excellent. We got four raciones and 2 tapas between 4 hungry men and it was just right. It gets pretty loud at weekends because they have a flamenco dance performance and music. All in good fun though."
5759,7,5,1,9/22/2011,"Amazing food, service, and entertainment. The food was great and very reasonably priced, service was attentive, and the flamenco was amazing. But, don't go here, I want to keep it all for myself."
5760,7,5,1,9/22/2011,Great place. They had awesome live Spanish music with dancers. Food was amazing and reasonably priced.
5761,7,5,1,9/21/2011,"Nai Tapas Bar is a dream come true! I made a reservation for 8 for my birthday brunch. This little spot caught my eye as I was walking around in EV because it looked so cute + intimate! Plus there was a sign that said $12.95 brunch special for Paella & a glass of Sangria! This is an AMAZING deal IMHO because the glass of sangria is $6-7 alone. I popped in one evening with a buddy for some drinks and the owner (I'm so sorry I didn't catch his name - he was amazing!) made the sangria right in front of us from scratch. I had the blueberry pomegranate champagne sangria - delish! Our paella took a while to come out (they warned us it takes around 30 mins) but our huge goblets of sangria filled that time up just fine! The brunch deal comes with a choice of either seafood paella or seafood + meat combo paella and a glass of sangria, wine, or beer. One of the girls in my group decided against the drinks so the owner brought out an extra one for me (the bday girl!) and my friend (the belated bday girl!). SUPER SWEET! He always checked up on us and was very accommodating when my friends brought out two giant cakes and sang happy birthday! A table away a few girls were eating brunch and they brought out a small cake with candles for her too! I looooove when restaurants do a little something special for their patrons when they are celebrating. The paella was so good! The chicken and chorizo were so juicy and flavorful - def go with the combo if you're in between (unless you don't eat meat) bc it's the best of ˜both worlds! The portions are pretty substantial so make sure to come hungry. We didn't order any tapas but the menu looked really appetizing :) At the end of our meal, the manager divy'd up the checks for us (manually!). It was such a pleasant meal :) A shame that there weren't too many people on a Sunday during brunch hours, but I'm sure it won't stay that way for long with reviews like mine & everyone elses before me!"
5762,7,5,1,9/7/2011,"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE. David and Carlos are such beautiful people. I love to come here for Happy Hour and most of the time, I end up staying until they close. They have a small seating area outside that is so great for spring/summer nights. Their food is spectacular. I recommend the lightly fried cod, white asparagus, mussels and clams, and chorizo. They have various flavors of Sangria. My favorite is definitely the Pomegranate Blueberry and Mango. Champagne and Tropical are also lovely flavors. This is truly a neighborhood gem, and I make my way out there every week there due to the lovely experience that I get every time."
5763,7,4,1,9/3/2011,"I had dinner last night with my two girl friends and it was an excellent choice for a Friday night! It's not crowded which is rare for a Friday night in the city but don't be fool by the emptiness because this place serves the best TAPAS that I've ever tasted. Try the Octopus and you won't be disappointed. The Spanish Omelet was okay, nothing special. ˜ Water and Sangria Red was constantly refilled, and I manage to drink a lot of water any time I go out so that was nice. ˜ Service was top notch, the server was very friendly! I can't even remember when was the last time I had this kind of friendliness in a restaurant in New York City. Everyone was friendly from the busboy to the waiter and up to the bartender. Polite + Friendly! And get this, when they waiter presented the food to us, the way he explain the food is like you're watching a Food Network channel. He was so passionate! A must try and definitely planning to go there again with some of my friends!"
5764,7,4,1,8/17/2011,"Great Service, Happy Hour and most importantly really good food. Great date spot if you're trying to impress but not break the bank."
5765,7,4,1,8/1/2011,Incredible flamenco show (free- Thursdays & Saturdays) as part of your dining. Be warned it is LOUD!! So don't expect to hear anyone at your table. The food was TASTY. ˜The meat and cheeses made me feel like I was in Spain. The white Sangria was execellent. Great place for drinks/tapas.
5766,7,4,1,7/30/2011,"Two friends suggested we go here, and I'm glad they did. I've walked past the place many times and have wanted to try it out, but it always seemed very busy (and now I know why). We met at 7 p.m. on a Thursday night, which was a good time to go. It wasn't busy yet although it kept filling up as we were there. The service was top-notch and the food was delicious. The empanadas and croquettes were especially good, as was the Spanish Omelet. I'm looking forward to going again and trying more of the dishes. It's a great gem of a place with nice staff and a good ambience."
5767,7,4,1,7/18/2011,"We were a party of 10 that had a reservation on a Saturday night for my brother's birthday dinner. The restaurant was a home run for a birthday celebration. The food was very good, reasonable. The staff was attentive and friendly. The flamenico show was awesome. The dancers take themselves very seriously. They performed from 8:30- 11pm with breaks in between. ˜At the end of their show, they sang happy birthday to my brother AND then they had him come onto the dance floor to dance with one of the female dancers. This was the highlight of our night."
5768,7,5,1,7/17/2011,"Sunday brunch at Nai was awesome! We arrived around mid-brunch and were promptly seated. We even got a table outside which was great since it was a lovely day and plenty of people were walking by. My boyfriend and I got the paella brunch which is both a great deal and delicious! For only $13, you get a giant paella which was well made and a sangria, wine, or beer. I don't think you'll find a deal this good elsewhere in Manhattan. Despite the deal, the paella was some of the best I've had in the City, and I am a paella fiend. I got the seafood paella and he got the mixed paella. They both feature fresh clams, mussels, shrimp, and scallops. The only difference between the two is that the mixed paella also had giant chunks of chicken and chorizo and the seafood paella had an extra langostino. The rice was perfect, cooked to a wonderful texture with just enough saffron. I thought the sangria was pretty tasty, too, with the fruit that was soaked in alcohol for a delicious amount of time. But on top of all of that, the service was excellent. The server was SO pleasant and really attended to all our needs. He even changed our waters mid-way through the meal because the ice had melted. All in all a wonderful experience. I think they just started their paella brunch menu so I really wanted to get this review up. Wanted to share this gem of a find!"
5769,7,5,1,7/9/2011,"I really can't remember when I've had nicer service. Everyone, from the busboy to the host to the waiter, was so courteous and polite. When my boyfriend dropped a knife, he was given a new one in a napkin--the kind of touch that you would expect at a much more expensive restaurant. While we were there, a fight broke out among a group of about twelve guys! The (amazing) flamenco performers were right in the middle of a piece, and the dancer carried on as if nothing was happening, although she was about a foot from the flying fists. Total pro! We were late making a reservation, and the waiter was all apologies that we weren't able to sit right next to the dancers--so much more kind than he needed to be. I can't recommend this place highly enough. Oh, and get the meatballs!"
5770,7,5,1,6/17/2011,"So happy my wife stumbled upon this place when she was looking for a restaurant with a flamenco show on Yelp - thank's fellow Yelpers! ˜ We liked this place so much that we went back with another group of friends less than a week later and they agree'd its great. ˜The food is awesome, the waiters are very attentive, and the flamenco show is amazing. ˜ Our waiter Raul recommended the meatballs, spicy potatoes, crab filled crepes, cod stuffed peppers, which was all followed up with some white wine sangria. We loved everything, can't wait to go back to try the meat dishes."
5771,7,4,1,6/5/2011,"A nice spot for Sangria and tapas. I had the escargot, the crab meat crepes and a few other items. The food was good the Sangrias were the best. You have to try the Blueberry and the Mango great. The service was fast and friendly. I got to go back for the Sangria."
5772,7,5,1,6/5/2011,"I went there last night and the food was phenomenal. So full of flavor. Our waiter was so attentive and gave us great suggestions about what to order. We did the tapas size of the calimari, shrimp in green sauce and the crabmeat crepes. We also got the cheese platter because I love cheese - even though the cheese was a little on the pricey side. Great red sangria as well. It was a very enjoyable experience overall. I felt like I was back in Spain ."
5773,7,5,1,5/16/2011,"WOWZER! What an amazing gem of a place. How do people hang out in the Meatpacking district and get boozed up with snobbery when such amazing, culturally sophisticated places exist, is beyond me. The food was so good! the drinks were amazing and what more can you ask for other than a live, 5 piece flamenco show with 2 female dancers, one male dancer, two guitarists and vocalists. come on a sat and/or thurs night for the live flamenco. i recommend going and not missing it, if at all possible."
5774,7,5,1,5/13/2011,Fantastic service and delicious food! Best Tortilla Espanola in the City. The service is super friendly and accomodating.
5775,7,4,1,5/5/2011,"This place caught our eye last week and we stopped in for dinner last night. It was a Wednesday, so there was only one other table being used. ˜The decor is nice and (obviously) we were seated right away. We asked how many dishes people usually order and were told two per person. This worked out well. We ordered pork with roasted peppers, patatas bravas, shrimp in garlic sauce, and the octopus with paprika. ˜The pork was the outstanding dish, followed by the patatas. The shrimp was solid but I would have liked a little more garlic to it. ˜As another commenter noted, the octopus was boiled, I like it prepared grilled, so I think we would skip it next time. It's too bad because the flavor was great, the consistency was just unpleasant. Water was constantly refilled, and I manage to drink a lot of water any time I go out so that was nice. ˜Service was top notch and we definitely plan to head back. Beer and wine only."
5776,7,5,1,4/18/2011,"I was really upset when Floridita Tapas closed in West Harlem, but cheered by the fact that they moved downtown into the former Xunta on First Ave near 11th. ˜This place is so welcoming, so wonderful, and such an improvement on the scurvy Xunta. ˜Food is excellent, music is real Spanish, and the nights they have live flamenco are amazing - make reservations. ˜Viva Nai!"
5777,7,5,1,4/9/2011,This place kicks ass!!
5778,7,4,1,4/4/2011,"As a group of nine on a Friday night, my friends and I were looking for a place to eat. Luckily we passed by the restaurant and saw a big table available. We were seated quickly. We ordered 8 dishes and a pitcher of sangria. I can't remember the name of the dishes but the escargot, chicken & potato, and the salmon croquette? were excellent. The mussels, seafood salad, side of potatoes, and crab crepes were okay too. This place lets you choose the size of each dish. We ordered mostly the ""larger"" size since we were a big group. Each of us paid about $17 - totally affordable. The only thing I didn't like was the cold bread but the sauce from the food made great dipping sauces!"
5779,7,4,1,4/3/2011,"Affordable, tasty food. ˜Lovely wait staff. ˜Great bar. ˜Live flamenco music/dancing on Saturday night. ˜Good crowd. ˜Wasn't too crowded. ˜Enjoyed it very much. ˜Wine was good. ˜Tortilla espanola was delish."
5780,7,5,1,3/5/2011,"Quick! -- Check this place out before the hipsters find it! I stopped in here this evening to munch on some tapas and check out the live Flamenco music. ˜What a great find! ˜The music was wonderful, and the atmosphere was even better. ˜Good food, interesting mix of people, tasty sangria, and a fun, unpretentious vibe. ˜ Also, the service is very good -- friendly and professional. ˜I particularly liked the bartender tonight, who was flying around doing ten things at once to keep up with all the orders pouring in, but she dropped what she was doing the moment my food order was up and brought it to me still piping hot. ˜I know it's a small thing, but I've had so many experiences at other bars where I watched with helpless longing as my food cooled off at the other end of the bar, I really appreciated that she didn't let that happen. They're doing free live Flamenco with musicians and dancers performing every Thursday and Saturday night, and I will most definitely be back for more!"
5781,7,3,1,2/24/2011,"An ok Spanish tapas place in the East Village that does happy hour until 7 - and their sangria at $5 was really stong and good. ˜About the food - it was all right. ˜I wished it was a bit tastier, but the service, ambiance, and drinks made up for it. ˜I would return for a small meal here for sure."
5782,7,5,1,2/18/2011,"This place has become my go-to when I need my Spanish food fix. ˜It brings me right back to Spain with the friendly atmosphere and delicious tapas and sangria. ˜The waiters are super attentive and friendly. ˜I went there on Valentine's Day and my boyfriend had bought me flowers so they brought over a vase with water to keep the flowers in during the meal. ˜I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a down to earth, yummy, night in the east village. ˜Good for groups as well."
5783,7,5,1,1/6/2011,"mola mucho! came here last night with a big group of friends for a bday party... we had an awesome time. i lived in madrid for a year, and i truly felt i was back there... from the look to the music to the accent of our waiter (racion pronounced ""rathion"" :) . the food was quite good and they did a good job recommending items to us (with 9 people ordering little plates, i was nervous we were going to end up with 18 servings of patatas bravas) as well as timing the serving of the food. the staff was super friendly and nice, and brought my friend dessert and sang and then even after we had paid, sent over two more pitchers of white sangria (which was very tasty) gratis. definitely recommend...and i want to go back on a night that there is a flamenco show!"
5784,7,5,1,1/1/2011,"Wow!What a great little place!We stumbled upon it by accident, and I'm so glad we did! Very cozy atmosphere of Espa?a with the extremely friendly staff and great music. We came on the flamenco night and it was unforgettable! Tapas, little portions of seafood,potatoes or chorizo, turned out to be so much fun, you are supposed to share it with your friends.There are 2 prices for a smaller and bigger portions. For 3 people the smaller portion was enough. We ordered 6 tapas and a salad. Sangrias were delicious and the bill turned out to be so much less than we expected! I definitely will come back there again and tell all my friends about this gem! Ol?!"
5785,7,5,1,12/21/2010,"I had dinner yesterday at Nai Tapas with my wife, excellent choice ! Very good prices, tasteful sangria, we had some stuffed mussels with bechamel, Tortilla, Tropical Salad, Croquetas, Calamari and Octopus, not a bad comment about the food, the waiter was very attentive at all time and is in a great location and good music, I heard they have flamenco on thursdays, We will be back very soon,"
5786,7,5,1,12/16/2010,love it! great food and amazing prices. fantastic staff. ˜flamenco shows. killer happy hour prices & ideal location. what more could you want?
5787,8,5,0,12/20/2014,Ordered food for my work from here and it was delicious. Everyone enjoyed it and I really loved everything! ! Especially the causa and the empanadas. ˜Although the causa was spicy which I don't eat I didn't want to stop! Yumm!!! The empanadas are so different than those that I've tried.
5788,8,5,0,11/13/2014,"Tried this place out a couple times already, usually for lunch but one time for dinner. I had ordered the Jalea and my girlfriend ordered the arroz chaufa (chicken fried rice)After eating at several Peruvian restaurants I have to say it was one of the best two dishes I've ever had! It tasted so fresh and not like it was loaded with oil and preservatives. The decor is plain and nothing special but the food alone is worth five stars."
5789,8,5,0,8/28/2014,Great service and delicious food i love this restaurant
5790,8,3,1,12/25/2014,"So my friend and I were looking for a local Peruvian restaurant since NYC's First Annual Peruvian Restaurant Week was barricaded behind an hour's worth of holiday traffic (worst time of the year to hold a restaurant week in regards to people living outside the city). After taking a look at a few places, we ultimately decided to go here due to its proximity to other bars. From the street at night, this place looks like a bodega only opened during the day. Getting a closer look inside, it really doesn't look much better unfortunately. A few tables in an open space (open is an understatement) and a TV showing cartoons was almost enough to make me turn around and go into the neighboring Cuban spot. Fortunately, we decided to press on and get some Peruvian food. The owners were very hospitable, offering up the dishes they had available (no causitas that night). Instead, we got papa la huancaina, tallarin verde and lomo saltado. The papa la huancaina lacked flavor. Needed both more spice and more salt. Luckily, I love potatoes and the slices were of good size. The tallarin verde also lacked flavor. Again, more salt was needed. Luckily, again the portions were big. Lots of linguini. BIG piece of steak on top. Took half of it home for a full meal. Added hot sauce for much needed flavor. Now for the lomo saltado. LOTS of flavor. Maybe a hair too much soy sauce, but there were plenty other ingredients that weren't too overpowered. They also offered 3 types of hot sauce - green, orange and red - which were all very tasty. The orange one being the hottest. So to sum up. Points off for the empty atmosphere. Hospitality is a plus. Food is bland, but very much salvageable with a little salt and hot sauce. Portions are enough for two whole meals. Overall, I'd probably go here often if I was local. Pick up some good eats and have a couple days worth of food."
5791,8,5,1,10/4/2014,First time in this place and the food was amazing. The special they had was so fresh and good. I tried the carapulcra and my friend had chaufinita which was really good. The drive was worth it.
5792,8,4,1,8/30/2014,"first impression, place looks a little sketchy and the decor is very dated. once you get past that, the Peruvian bread is pretty good and the lomo saltado is up there with the best I've had. very juicy and flavorful. their salsa verde is very tasty and got good kick. definitely worth trying again."
5793,8,5,1,7/13/2014,Had the jalea and papa la huancanie( something like that) delicious delicious delicious! This place is a hidden gem. We order chicken and the lomo saltado again and it was consistent ˜like last time. ˜Sometimes there's not a lot of ppl there because they order it to go but don't be afraid to sit down and eat. The last two times we came in and sat down and watched the World Cup games lol enjoy!! ** street parking or there's free parking diagonally across behind this deli or around the corner. So worth it though!
5794,8,5,1,7/7/2014,Tried out their lunch specials today and their chicken with fries and rice with that amazing green hot sauce keeps me coming back.
5795,8,5,1,5/7/2014,Just tried out some Peruvian food here and I have to say the Lomo Saltado was as good as when I had it on my trip to Macchu Piccihu a few years ago. Very authentic and staff was friendly. Welcome addition to the neighborhood and I can't wait to try the lunch specials.
5796,8,5,1,5/6/2014,Walked in here unexpectedly for lunch and food was amazing! They have great lunch menu so was tempted to try. So glad I did! It's a brand new restaurant and so happy I gave it a try. Will be coming back.
5797,9,1,0,1/6/2015,"Maybe at one time, this place was good, but now it just makes some of the worst. ˜Don't believe the hype. ˜Pats and Genos make the worst cheesesteaks in Philly. ˜You'd be better off going to a food truck. ˜If you want a great cheesesteak when you come to D'Alessandros, Jim's, or Del Rossi's. ˜Skip the tourist traps. Places like this are giving out of towners the wrong idea about cheesesteaks. ˜Take it from someone who's lived here for years. ˜The locals don't eat here. ˜It's GARBAGE."
5798,9,1,0,12/18/2014,I would give this place a 0 . I drove an hour to get to this place thinking this cheesesteak was going to be amazing . What a turn off . They are so rude and sarcastic . I will never come back to this place . Their cheese steak was terrible on top of it and not even hot . No appreciation for their customers .
5799,9,1,0,12/9/2014,So me giving one star to Geno's steaks seems like a fair enough deal me and my wife were very excited to travel to Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak from Gino's as we dreaded the long wait for a 8 inch sub was not worth the wait I like to order my cheese steaks with onion mayonnaise ketchup and hot sauce in light Peppers as I approached the window and gave the gentleman my order he explained to me they don't make their sandwiches that way there ˜already pre made so I bought two cheesesteaks my cheesesteaks were cold and tasted like rubber their customer service was horrible there seating arrangements were horrible there are hundreds of other locations in Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak and I'm sad to say that I did not choose else where to eat I will never eat at Geno's again ok
5800,9,1,0,11/12/2014,"After reading all of the negative reviews, I really wasn't interested in trying Geno's. But my husband had some distant memory about it being good--so we tried it. HUMONGOUS DISAPPOINTMENT. I wasted $38 in cash for food that tasted like seasoned-less meat wrapped in a cardboard ˜box. Calling the food 'sub-par' is generous, at best! And if overt racism and ignorance offends your sense of moral decency, it'd be best to stay away. ˜No one at Geno's was particularly rude. But standing in line there reading a 'I Want My Country Back' sign with a demand that you 'order in English' really brought home to me what this establishment represents. I'd already paid for the cheesesteaks by this time. But I'm still kicking myself for handing over my hard-earned money to such ignorance. Spend your money at places that don't literally throw their racism in your face, and that ALSO serves good food. DON'T GO!!!"
5801,9,1,0,11/12/2014,"Their cheesestake had absolutely no taste WHATSOEVER! ˜I think the only seasoning they use is salt. ˜It sat in my stomach like a ball of steel. ˜The hole in the wall joints in Philly that barely even look like they are in business have the best cheesestakes by far! ˜Geno's only sells steak subs and they don't even provide a tasty product. ˜ The other turn off for me was the fact they have posted ""Let's take this country back"" signs around the establishment. ˜""Speak English if you order at the window"" signs are posted there. ˜They only sell steak subs there so it's not like the menu is complicated. ˜You only have one selection for God's sake! ˜What kind of bigot runs this dump? You will be more satisfied at McDonald's."
5802,9,1,0,11/11/2014,"Was very disappointed, I have seen more meat on a chicken nugget. Cheese wasn't much either. I have heard good things about this place, but it seems it's now a tourist disappointment."
5803,9,1,0,10/29/2014,"It will do in a pinch to show an out-of-towner the experience of eating in ""cheesesteak vegas"" but honestly, kinda gross overall. And they're racist, so, um, yeah..."
5804,9,1,0,10/23/2014,"The owner is a bigoted douche. They have a sign stating that all orders must be in English. My Italian Grandmother who can only speak broken English tried to order a cheese steak and was flat out denied. The cashier was extremely rude to both myself and my Grandmother. I cancelled my order and literally told them to shove my order up their A$$. We went elsewhere for lunch. Never again will I go here. I had to explain to my Grandmother what transpired, very embarrassing."
5805,9,1,0,10/14/2014,"I'm sorry, I just don't get the hype. My friend visited Philly in 2007... she had one of the ""famous steaks"" (I shared some of her awful, soggy fries) and she got food poisoning right after that. The steak was barely cooked, and lukewarm. And they weren't even busy. I'm not into the completely unfriendly staff, either... if you are new to the area and don't know EXACTLY how to order a cheesesteak, you're screwed. Just not into it. Great-looking place, no doubt.... but no thanks. Genos gives me a great reason to become vegan, as I've been trying to do for months."
5806,9,1,0,10/13/2014,"Cheesesteaks here are WAY too fat and greasy. You can tell there is not much effort put into the cheesesteak or the place itself. It is too flashy and it looks like a wannabe Las Vegas keychain with lights. The policy and kind of racist and I had better cheesesteaks in South Korea and the staff are rude, I don't blame them, I mean that's everyone in Philly."
5807,9,1,0,10/13/2014,"The cheesesteaks here are okay, very fat and greasy but bland flavor. I've had better cheesesteaks in South Korea. This place's decorations is too flashy and tries way too hard to be like Las Vegas but is more like a thrift shop light bulb fail. The cheese steaks aren't that good. Also, the policy is also kind of racist. This place should fix up there place and there cheesesteaks. I shouldn't and went and I won't come back. The cheesesteak is also over priced. I live in a condo in Philly and I hate passing by Geno's. It makes me sick and I won't come back."
5808,9,1,0,10/12/2014,"I like the cheesesteaks here and I think it's okay but it's just to greasy and fat like most people in Philly, and frankly the only thing Philly is known for is cheesesteaks. I waited too long for an overpriced disappointment and other people shouldn't go through this, also the policy is kind of racist. Honestly I think coming here was a mistake and I don't want to come here again."
5809,9,1,0,10/12/2014,"Honestly, there isn't much to Geno's but there cheesesteaks. You wait for a long time and buy an overpriced cheese steak and eat it and it's not really worth it. There policy is a little racist also. There really isn't much to Philly but cheesesteaks. It's not even that good, anyone could make a better quality one at home. It's alright but I rather never go there."
5810,9,1,0,10/12/2014,"Ok. Here's the truth. You line up for 25 minutes, pay $10 for a piece of Philly culture, then chomp down on a greasy mess that is nothing more than a guilty pleasure. It's fun, do it once, then try making it at home. See? You made it at home!!! AND It's cheaper and better than with Geno's or Pat's. And it was easy to make!!!"
5811,9,1,0,10/12/2014,tourist trap. chunky meat disgusting wiz
5812,9,1,0,10/6/2014,"To be honest I have no idea how this place has stayed in Business so long. This was one of the worst if not the worst subs I have ever had, the bread was almost inedible the steak or whatever it was was so dry and flavorless that card board would have tasted better, the onions we just about raw. Really just a terrible all around place. The servers were vary rude and make the whole experience that much worse."
5813,9,1,0,10/3/2014,"Food was just alright. It's definitely overrated. I was really offended by the ""speak English only"" and ""I want my country back"" signs. Had I seen those racist signs earlier, I would have never ordered my food from these disgusting racists. Would never ever come back again. DISGUSTING!"
5814,9,1,0,9/28/2014,"Never a judge or a juror , just a foodie. We took the Philly challenge, ˜6...different cheesesteaks, from 6..different spots BELIEVE me, this is going to help you greatly...if you trust me on this. BREAD ,MEAT,TOPPINGS,OVERALL ˜SANDWICH. ˜I am so upset at the over rated media feeding frenzy over Pat's and Geno's ˜we ˜took the blue pill, and ended up at Geno's, there was a large black man in front of the shop....but it wasn't Morpheus,it was the grimm reaper, killing every hope of Geno's Steaks to ˜win the challenge.....horrible these people have thrown in the towel. When Geno's knows people will just come for the challenge, and they don't have to put in the effort they don't......a clear loser....don't waist your time or money on this hack cheesesteak.... I'm Tony Soprano ....wackum, from your sub list."
5815,9,1,0,9/19/2014,Tourist trap. Pat's is slightly better.
5816,9,1,0,9/18/2014,"The cheesesteak ˜sucked, and didn't have enough whiz wit. Also, they are racist. Also, if I would have seen the ""English Only"" sign I would have not bothered going here. There are many places to get a good (cheesesteak in Philly. Go somewhere else."
5817,9,1,0,9/11/2014,Maybe because its become an institution but I don't get all the rave. ˜All hype no delivery. ˜Better off finding a whole in the wall and spending your money there. ˜Is this really an authentic philly cheesesteak? Disappointing to say the least.
5818,9,1,0,9/5/2014,"This tourist trap is so obnoxious that it belongs in las vegas, overcompensate much? But it has the racism of true south Philly. If the ""this is america, order in english"" sign isn't flagrant enough, the shrine to police officers is. This looks of this place will make you sick before you even eat the overpriced food. My advice is to go anywhere else, mom and pop shop for a better steak for half the price."
5819,9,1,0,9/3/2014,"Haha, are you even going to read this review? Probably not. You're just going to go to Geno's and get a steak. You're not going to care about the legacy or racism this business prides itself upon. You're not going to be bothered by their deplorable practices, or the shitty way in which they treat home owners in the neighborhood. So I will just say: if there was one business I could wipe off the face of the earth forever, it would be Geno's. I'm tired of tourists taking strained bowel movements on my front steps at 4AM because Geno's won't let them use their bathroom."
5820,9,1,0,8/29/2014,OVER PRICED TO OIL'Y ˜no real meat flavor and over rated i prefer PAT'S cheesestakes
5821,9,1,0,8/27/2014,"Did not like my cheese steak...everyone i know has raved about this place but i did not like it at all. Also not a fan of the ""speak English"" sign. I am sure no one goes to the window speaking a different language, maybe broke English but at least they are trying. We're not called the melting pot because our ancestors are all born and raised English speaking Americans......"
5822,9,1,0,8/27/2014,"This place gets a ˜lot of hype...and now they are in the gyco commercial....sandwiches don't life up to the hype and I do not care for the ""speak English"" sign. His ancestors probably didn't speak English when they first came here...everyone has to learn and most people learn the hard way which is by being in the environment; don't make them feel bad. Not everyone is an illegal immigrate."
5823,9,1,0,8/22/2014,"The worst ""cheese steak"" I have ever tasted. ˜Please avoid this place and this city. Brotherly love my donkey's feces. ˜Traveled much of the world none more rude, or food worse. ˜Don't believe me? ˜Please go then. ˜Oh, I through the thing away. Would not feed it to the many homeless in the area."
5824,9,1,0,8/22/2014,"Not chopped, fat is visible and gross (to me), more bread than substance"
5825,9,1,0,8/20/2014,A truly spectacular flop when it came to food quality or customer service. How this place continues to have line ups is truly baffling. We certainly won't be back
5826,9,1,0,8/19/2014,"Zero stars. Pass this place up. The only words I can use to describe this joint are; dry,tasteless, expensive, CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!! do yourself a favor, take picture and go anywhere else !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5827,9,1,0,8/9/2014,yuck !
5828,9,1,0,8/3/2014,"There are no mistakes when I say that this place is the worst place to eat at. My wife and I ate here earlier and it gave us a really bad upsets stomach/diarrhea/food poisoning. They don't wear gloves while working with the food and charge an outrageous price for something I can get at anywhere.who cares what celebrity ate there in the past. ˜Unsanitary methods of serving is a health concern. I called back to let them know that something is wrong with the food and they cursed me out on the phone, told me that ""I must be eating dirty pussy and that's why I had diarrhea."" If you value your health and want an enjoyable visit, then do NOT eat at Gino's."
5829,9,1,0,7/29/2014,Lucky they get one star...believe me grew up in the neighborhood...Genoa steaks are fare...Not the best!!!I I make better in my kitchen...GENOS IS PLAIN OUT RUDE!.RUDE..but what do they care...people still eat there!!....If people just stopped going there it would end all there B.S....plus TONY LUKES HAS PATS AND GENOS BEAT BY MILES!!!...BETTER MEAT!!..BETTER SERVICE...
5830,9,1,0,7/18/2014,sorry a delsandros fan
5831,9,1,0,7/8/2014,"I would have to pretty much agree with Scott and Matt, except I would give Geno's a much lower rating than ""Meh, I've experienced better."" I realize that this is a long review, but I highly suggest you read what I have to say. I have heard so many amazing things about Philadelphia's legendary cheese steak sandwiches, and was looking really forward to trying one for myself. I only had two days in Philadelphia, and ate my first Philly lunch at Tommy DiNic's in the Reading Terminal Market. I naturally wanted some cheese steak before I left, so instead of doing a cheese steak ""challenge"", I blindly chose Geno's over Pat's or Tony Luke's. Needless to say, I have quite a few complaints. 1) Hidden racism. Though I am of Asian descent, I am still an American, so I feel like I deserve to be treated like an American. Immediately, I saw a sign on one of Geno's windows that said something along the lines of ""You are in America. Please order in English."" My first thought: Really? Did you expect me to order in Korean? How about some Japanese? Hell, why not Mongolian? 2) Quality of service. Definitely the worst part of this restaurant. The guy working there was alright, but the woman was nothing short of a witch. Again, the fact that my family is Asian sort of plays into this. As soon as we walked up to the register, they rolled their eyes and kept staring us down while we were deciding what to order. There was no line, there was nobody else waiting to order... Then, when my dad ordered, there was no question of ""What cheese would you like?"" or ""Would that be all?"" Not even a ""Thank you"" when we paid. 3) The food. What we ordered was definitely not worth the about $30 we spent. By far the most disappointing sandwich I have ever had. It was bland, terrible, and have I mentioned disappointing? Pretty sure I could've gotten much better food for less money... 4) The end. As disappointed as I was, I couldn't finish my cheese steak and fries. It was an easy task wrapping up my sandwich in the paper it came in, but the cup holding the fries didn't have a lid. ""Excuse me, can I get a lid for this?"" I asked politely. The woman working the joint practically belched out, ""WE DON'T HAVE LIDS!"" Startled, I jumped back a bit and bumped into a Philly native. The woman proceeded to give me a piece of wax paper to cover the cup. In the meantime, I apologized to the man I ran into. ""Sorry, sir, I was just startled by her attitude."" I snatched the wax paper she begrudgingly held out to me and turned to my car. ""YOU WANT A BAG?"" I ignored her and left. For those of you who thought ""TL;DR"", just save your money and don't go to Geno's. If you do go, hope you're prepared for regret. Pretty much sums that up."
5832,9,1,0,7/8/2014,EUH!
5833,9,1,0,6/28/2014,"Horribly dry, meat has no flavor, and onions were nasty. They didn't melt the cheese, they just put 2 slices in the bread and put meat on top. My wife actually brought me on from a food cart once that tasted better. ˜I should have listened to the ratings everyone on yelp gave it. I hope this isn't representative ˜of Philly people and their famous cheesesteaks. I saw this on a tv show and came down from Baltimore to try it, never again. I guess the museums were very cool. Everyone just try the one across the street, the line seemed pretty long."
5834,9,1,0,6/25/2014,"shit steaks go literally anywhere else, total tourist trap."
5835,9,1,0,6/23/2014,Overrated. Skimpy on meat. Server very rude & impatient.
5836,9,1,0,6/17/2014,Tourist trap #2. Nuff' said.
5837,9,1,0,6/10/2014,Garbage. People from Philly don't go here so why would you.
5838,9,1,0,4/23/2014,"Don't recommend this place, they treat you like cattle."
5839,9,1,0,4/22/2014,"Geno's uses an inferior/cheaper cut of steak than Pat's uses, and does not know how to make it taste as good as it potentially should. Why settle for Geno's when the real thing is across the street? I used to be a chef at an expensive restaurant, so I know what I am talking about. Geno's has a more attractive building, but who cares?"
5840,9,1,0,4/14/2014,Stay away! Geno's is such a tourist trap. The cheesesteak is chewy and the fries are horrible. ˜Head across the street to Pat's if you want a good Philly cheesesteak. ˜The service is much better there as well. ˜Geno's is horrible. We'll never go back!
5841,9,1,0,4/7/2014,"Too much hype. Meat was dry, wayyy too much cheese, and the roll was ice cold. The only good thing about my ""wiz wit"" were the onions."
5842,9,1,0,4/5/2014,"Like Pat's, this place is also gross."
5843,9,1,0,3/20/2014,"This place sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Both Pat's and Genos are not worth the hype. If youre from Maryland, save the trip and just go to Jerrys or Continental down in kensington near DC. The service was horrible and there were no toppings! The flavor was so bland, we saved the subs and took them home to add toppings to it to not make it taste as nasty. Again, not worth the hype"
5844,9,1,0,2/22/2014,Sucks. ˜Bigots with bad food ... what less could you ask for? ˜Try Jim's on South Street!
5845,9,1,0,1/26/2014,"One glance at this set-up was enough to send my group and I running. Don't believe the hype about Geno's. In reality, it is completely grease-caked, and fly infested. There's a much better indoor place just straight down the street!"
5846,9,1,0,1/26/2014,just as bad as pats. these two places are where you can get the lousiest cheese steak in the city.
5847,9,1,0,1/21/2014,"For all the hype of Pats vs Genos, the sandwiches are not what they used to be. You can tell that its just a token name for people visiting Philly at this point. There are a ton of places in Philly that can get you a sandwich, wiz or provolone, that are much better quality."
5848,9,1,0,1/8/2014,Boo this garbage tourist trap. Go to Jim's on South
5849,9,1,0,1/7/2014,Serving overpriced dry meat and chewy roll is a CRIME. I can't believe this place still selling Cheese steak. Will not recommend!
5850,9,1,0,12/30/2013,"Last stop on our first trip to Philly. Left a very bad last impression of the city. Steak was so skimpy we actually had to complain, to no effect. These people obviously do not need or want tourists. Should have gone back to Reading Market, which was awesome."
5851,9,1,0,12/27/2013,"We drove from NYC to attend a day at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Wonderful day trip until we took the suggestion of a couple of locals to head over to this dump for cheese steak. The bread, meat, onions were just ˜as tasteless as the people who were serving it up. ˜I had a stomach ache all night after eating one of these fake cheese steaks. Sorry for you Philadelphia ...YUKKK!!"
5852,9,1,0,12/27/2013,Less than average. Just hype nothing more
5853,9,1,0,12/5/2013,I don't agree with their English only policy.
5854,9,1,0,12/3/2013,I don't understand why people wait in line to pay over $9.00 for a cheese steak with hardly any meat and cold wiz??? I guess there is a sucker born every minute.
5855,9,1,0,12/3/2013,"All I have to say is OVERRATED. Just spend $250,000 a year on advertising and charging $9.00 for a sandwich that everyone else in Philadelphia does better for $6.50. Don't worry plenty of people from New Jersey that don't know any better will buy it tho."
5856,9,1,0,11/30/2013,"What a shame. ˜Brought my family to Philly for the holidays and wanted to try out this establishment. ˜What a shame to see the racism in this place. ˜People were so rude, we left and went to Jim's at 400 South St. They didn't want my dollars, so I would never eat here nor would I recommend anyone do so either. ˜What a shame..."
5857,9,1,0,11/23/2013,"not very impressive to say the least.. plain old bread with dry meat and a couple of slices of provolone cheese which was buried halfway thru the sandwich. And seriously, what's up with ""cheese whiz""? don't see what all the fuss is about.. got a cheese steak sandwich from another place. Not going to name them but the name starts with an ""a""... a much better sandwich. but I guess if some people really think genos is the best then im not going to say anything except that genos must be the only cheese steak they have eaten..."
5858,9,1,0,11/18/2013,"Pros: ˜A famous place known for great cheese steaks. ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Very street style atmosphere, covered outdoor (simple) seating ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ AMAZING BREAD ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Very ethnic area, many shops nearby that sell in a family style market environment. ˜One shop nearby sold live poultry. ˜Other shops sold freshly made cheese. ˜Fruit stands line the streets nearby. ˜And some buildings have murals on the side nearby. ˜Great to just walk around this place. Cons: A tiny bit over priced ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Steak was awful, paltry amount, and was hard to go down. ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ I felt duped ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ No vinegar (for fries), and no mayonaise (for the cheesesteak) was available. ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ No bathroom for paying customers and no public bathrooms nearby, 10 or more tables outside. ˜It's one thing to operate a small out the window shop locally, but this is a tourist place, and we drove an hour for to eat. ˜We had a very negative experience finding a company that would let us use their bathroom. ˜ ˜ Overall: ˜This store is about what works for the owner. ˜The customer comes second. ˜They don't provide the condiments a reasonable New Englander would want for Cheesesteak and fries, a bathroom for paying customers despite having 10 tables (or so), and respect to hispanic immigrants (as they have a sign up that says, ""This is America, Speak English""). ˜It's just a guy with a nasty attitude running a business built on a reputation that has long be overused."
5859,9,1,0,11/18/2013,Tourist crap.
5860,9,1,0,11/14/2013,Obnoxious lights. Pats steaks are so much better across the street. Long live King Pat Steaks!
5861,9,1,0,11/12/2013,The place is hit or miss. You must eat the sandwich fast if not it turns to leather. Jim from south philly

5863,9,1,0,11/1/2013,"Blows. Pat's and Geno's is supposed to be a Philly staple... it is disgusting. Loads of cheeze wiz, not meat (crappy meat), all bread.... maybe it used to be good but now it is just a name."
5864,9,1,0,10/30/2013,"You call that a cheese steak. Don't waste your money. Too up tight. Hit up delasandro's. or even better, there's a mexican place down the street all green that has a banging burrito and guacamole and chips."

5868,9,1,0,9/13/2013,"The cheesesteak I had was horrible. ˜It was a steakum not a cheesesteak. ˜I don't think I will ever understand why they are as popular as they are, much better places to get a good quality cheesesteak from in the city."
5869,9,1,0,9/13/2013,Everybody seems to think that Philly cheese steaks are sppose to be a hit because of the reputation it has around the country and perhaps world. ˜I am here to report that Philly cheese steak at Genos and several others I thought I would try thru out my stay in Philly and was thoroughly disappointed. ˜Not good!

5873,9,1,0,8/23/2013,"I've been here twice, once to say I've been here and the second time to see if the steak was any better. Sadly, it wasn't. Pat's isn't any better really. Geno's, first of all, has the most obnoxious staff. They're almost downright rude. The Philadelphia image struggles as it is, and these guys don't help it one bit. The meat was greasy, and the cheese-wiz on it could be used to fill pot-holes. The bread was better by itself. To have heard so much about these two places, and end up feeling like I ate a brick will not bring me back here again."

The bread was the same in both places. Both places were clean and the food came out fast. For me on this day, it came down to the flavor of the meat itself and it didn't happen at Geno's today."
5880,9,1,0,7/17/2013,"Rude, rude, rude. I know what I want and I order quickly so why the hell do they need to rush me? Had one steak from them and never again, tastes like a shitload of oil.

5881,9,1,0,6/25/2013,geno's is awful. along with pats they are the most overated steak in the city .Steve's steaks is hands down the best steak around
5882,9,1,0,6/18/2013,I guess since I was born and raised here I'm not that impressed. ˜There are so many more neighborhood places that are way better. ˜I also don't like that Italian Joey bag of donuts vibe you get in South Philly
5883,9,1,0,6/10/2013,"The Employee's are HORRIBLE & VERY RUDE which lead's to VERY POOR customer service, not to mention the Steak & Cheese Sandwiches were over rated.

5884,9,1,0,6/8/2013,"Everyone says that Geno's has the best steaks in Philly. What a crock! They are awful. Highly commercialized is all. The best steaks in Philly are at Jim's steaks. One is on south street, and one in the northeast. Steer clear of Geno's. all you will get is a small, overpriced, tasteless steak, a stomachache, and a ticket to the nearest bathroom."
5885,9,1,0,6/7/2013,"over priced, overrated. i always get provolone on my steak, but at this place you need wiz because these steaks are so bad you can't put decent ingredients on them. ˜pat's across the street is a step up, but i'd stick with jim's."
5886,9,1,0,6/6/2013,Cold Steak? Old Bread? Racist Owner? Count me in. If they made good cheese steaks I would still give a decent review but Pat's is better any day of the week. This place does not deserve to be such a Philly landmark with such bad food. This city is known for its food so step your game up.

5890,9,1,0,5/4/2013,"I dont get why this place is so hyped , you get low grade grissely meat , NO FLAVOR !! , this is a tourist trap , all lights , no might , Pats across the street ˜is a lot better , good quality meat , others to try are jims steaks , tony lukes , or my favorite delosandros"
5891,9,1,0,5/3/2013,"Digusting. ˜They stay open based on tourism. ˜I saw them on tv and decided to go when I was in Philly. ˜Cheap bread, gross tasting meat, and some kind of butter slime that coated my mouth and throat and would not go away for hours. ˜Ended up giving it to a homeless person after 2 bites. ˜Never again."
5892,9,1,0,4/24/2013,Go to Jim's on South!
5893,9,1,0,4/21/2013,Geno's sucks so bad it is an embarrassment to food. ˜The only steak worse is Pat's. ˜I mean other steaks stink in the city but these two are supposed to be the king pings and they honestly stink! ˜Eat your sneaker before buying a steak; or for God's sake get a burrito or a snickers? ˜Save yourself and do #2 Tony Luke's - Everything he sells is fabulous. ˜Want the best period...Joes aka the old Ch!nks. ˜3rd banana is Steve's prince of steaks and in fourth is Dalessandro's in Roxborough!
5894,9,1,0,4/20/2013,"Went on a cheesesteak tasting adventure in Philidelphia. ˜Geno's was number four on the list. ˜This place was abismal. ˜Truthfully, I'm surprised to see any good reviews of this place on yelp at all. ˜All i can figure is that this is the only place many people have tried in the area. ˜Got a hot sandwich (that was luke warm when served) with peppers, onions and cheese on it and was not inspired to smile from the experience. Here's the theory me and my cohorts developed on why Geno's is trash... First it's all covered in bright lights and orange painted crap which is gimmicky which is the first clue that they are hiding something. ˜We went to the number one place on the list which served hot fresh meat that seemed to be top quality. ˜We decided that the fatty gristly slices of meat served with smug frugality at Geno's are likely collected from the dumpster of john's roast pork. ˜The bread is probably collected from what tony luke's throws away and is served moist and not toasted. ˜The cheese on the sandwiches... maybe the recession or economic downturn has hit Geno in his family jewels harder than expected because there was virtually no provolone on my sandwich. ˜Even the onions were served up in teaspoon proportions. ˜The whole peppers that were served in the sandwich were not easy to eat and didn't even complement any of the weak flavors in the meat or bread. ˜In conclusion after sampling this sandwich among the group we concurred that it's an overhyped concoction of leftovers or waste from better cheesesteak vendors in the Philly area. If you're going to hit up cheesesteaks in Philly and aren't forced here by someone who has poor taste or an inability to taste food, skip it. ˜The cheesesteak served across the street was way better and there's probably a couple other places higher on the list that were mentioned above. ˜If Geno's spent less money on fluorescent lights and orange paint and more on meat, cheese, bread, and skills in the kitchen I'm sure it would be good."
5895,9,1,0,4/13/2013,"Geno (can't even spell his name right in Italian), is a racist, narcissistic attention grabber who has more in common with neon signs than serving dry steak sandwiches. He disgraced himself with his comments about Mexicans ordering in English. Truth be told, this is a tourist trap. There is a plethora of better places in Philly to enjoy. Find them...any one of them."
5896,9,1,0,4/3/2013,We always go to Jim's steaks when in Philly ˜but today decided to try the hyped up Gino's what a disaster we would never go out back we actually paid $27 for three sandwiches and after one bite threw them in the trash not only was the food disgusting but the staff was extremely extremely rude again don't go there go to Jim's not worth the price the hassle or the rude staff. ˜ The man at the counter was so rude that when we returned to the window to explain that one of our sandwiches was made incorrectly he actually argued with us. After leaving Gino's we went back to our tried and true jims steaks and had a fabulous lunch... So Gino's take your steak sandwich and stick it up your ass!!! ˜I will really wish Yelp would allow me not to choose any stars because Gino's does not deserve the one I left.
5897,9,1,0,3/23/2013,First off I'm not from South Philly and I hate cheese wiz. I'm not in the demo and they did not have the quality of protein I look for in my cheesesteaks. I 99% of the time get a chicken cheese steak made with fresh breast meat and Swiss cheese and that was not an option. I'll never go back and you can include Pats.
5898,9,1,0,3/20/2013,"Sadly, since it's such a trek to get there, Geno's was just about the only thing I did in Philadelphia, and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Wish I read the reviews first! Hard to enjoy sitting outdoors (in winter) eating an overpriced blah sandwich in the picturesque Italian/Mexican market neighborhood, with disturbing anti-Hispanic signs on the wall. I'd rather have had lunch just about anywhere else."
5899,9,1,0,3/18/2013,"I went to Geno's in Philly after watching it in the food network. WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. THIS PLACE IS OVER RATED! The steak sandwich was cold, not flavor and the most disappointing thing was the lady behind the counter, she was so rude. Bad food and bad service! I'llNEVER GO BACK TO GENO'S!"
5900,9,1,0,3/16/2013,"Decided to visit this place and Pats while on vaca in Wildwood two summers ago. ˜Big Mistake. ˜The trip was to visit the Barnes Foundation before it closed, but we also planned to have lunch at both of these hyped up shops. ˜Again, big mistake. ˜ The steaks at both places were of, i dunno, the shitty Subway or Quiznos variety. ˜Flavorless, small, lacking in just about everything that makes a cheesesteak great. The best cheesesteak I've ever had was actually in Wildwood years back on the boardwalk back when the Australian students used to work during the summers. ˜Quality bread, nice meat with the right amount of juice, slathered in good cheese. ˜ Theres a reason this place only has 2.5 stars. ˜Those who rated it ˜more than 1 or 2 stars are delusional, or have simply never had a good cheesesteak."
5901,9,1,0,3/13/2013,"RUDE! ˜Big emphasis on that. ˜Being friendly and polite goes a long way with the majority of people, who could be potential repeat, loyal customers. ˜Cheesesteaks are tasteless and expensive, separate lines for drinks/fries and for steaks. ˜Huge sign about you have to speak English when ordering. ˜They have a sign telling you how to order (wit or witout onions), which makes you sound like a piece of garbage, which is what genos is, garbage. ˜Also there's a vibe that you might get beaten up if you look at someone the wrong way the whole time you're there. ˜Don't go there. ˜Once again, they're incredibly, offensively rude. ˜No logic to their operation here."
5902,9,1,0,3/11/2013,"Order in 'merican only! Pats is better. Who wants this flourescent tourist trap steak shop when there are tons of better spots... Cheesesteak is the same as getting it from any delivery pizza joint, except you don't have to wait 20 min for delivery"
5903,9,1,0,3/8/2013,Worst steaks in the city...tourist trap...pat's too
5904,9,1,0,2/13/2013,This place is HORRIBLE!! ˜Terrible cheesesteaks with a racist attitude. ˜I wish I could give them a zero but the system wont allow it. ˜Way to make the tourists and immigrants feel welcomed Genos!! ˜It is a shame that they are so bitter and hateful that they would post that racist nonsense. ˜As far as the food goes the cheesesteaks stink!! ˜ Don't waste your time and money on this place. ˜In all honesty you can get a better cheesesteak at Apple bees or one of those chain restaurants. Johns Roast Pork and Jim's Steaks are both MUCH better and from what I have seen ALL are welcomed.
5905,9,1,0,2/6/2013,"Avoid this place. ˜A friend and I drove there after a convention yesterday. ˜He told me that these two places are famous and they have a long time feud going between the two places. ˜We first passed Pat's as we approached Geno's looking for a parking spot. ˜Since we found a spot across from Genos we figured we'd try them since it was really cold out. ˜I looked at the sign and said $9.00 for a sandwich??? OK, I figured it's gotta be good. We stepped up to the window and I noticed that nobody in the place was smiling or at least looked like they wanted to serve you. ˜I know a little about serving people from the other side of the counter as I have done it for close to 25 years. We tried to make conversation with the guy at the window who was not impressed or interested. He was really good at saying ""What'l ya have"" and then says "" Nine Dollaz"" while the guy to his right scrapes the meat off the grill and drops it into the bread. ˜Then he puts two slices of Provolone and slaps some little onion squares on it and wraps it in paper. ˜I asked what do you do for drinks and he then had a very lengthy conversation ""Next window"" and slid the window shut. ˜I followed directions and went to the woman at the next window and she was just as polite. ˜She said ""Two dollaz"" and handed me my soda. I had a bad feeling about how the famous cheese steak was going to taste. ˜I unwrapped it to find about 5 small slices of meat with a trace of provolone showing under all those onion chicklets falling out all over the place. They reminded me of the onion bits at Costco's food court, only larger. Cooked a little but not really glazed like a good onion should be on a sandwich like this. ˜Half of them fell out as I was eating. ˜While I was really trying to enjoy my $11 investment I looked around and could see why others would be offended. They really rub it in your face with all the signs. I told my buddy that it was probably the worst attempt of a cheese steak I've ever had. ˜You can do better at Quiznos which I happen to think makes a great sandwich. ˜I was extremely disappointed and wanted to get my wife a cheese steak because she grew up in Philly and I figured I'd try Pat's for her take home. There was no way I was going to make the same mistake twice. ˜The guys at Pat's were a tad friendlier, maybe because I told them how bad Geno's sandwich was but they definitely slammed a whole lot more meat on the bread without me even saying anything. ˜I took a bite of hers to compare and there was no comparison. ˜It was definitely heftier and tastier. ˜Now, mind you, I will never go back to either place because neither one is worth it in my opinion. ˜We froze our asses off at the outdoor tables while you could see a seating section in the center of the restaurant at Genos where I guess they let famous people eat indoors while they take pictures with them leaving everyone else to eat outside. ˜I didn't even want to ask to use a restroom. People, invest your hard earned money wisely by avoiding places like this. We passed many small eateries where I'm sure $11 buys a better sandwich and drink where the people smile and you can sit for awhile inside. ˜Needless to say we both agreed that if we're ever in Philly again we would hit up the other joints. ˜All in all, I have to say even though the sandwich wasn't cheesy, the d?cor was!"
5906,9,1,0,1/15/2013,"a---hole owner. Mediocre, gristly steak sandwich. ˜Avoid"
5907,9,1,0,12/17/2012,Steer clear of this place. Like all people already stated before ignorant racist ba....ds. Whoever heard of a place where you can only get ketchup and cheez whiz on your steak? Sad part is that they tried to take thier business to Dover DE. Thay had the same ignorant attitude there. Happy to say they closed thier doors within a few months. Delawareans weren't having it. Philadelphians should do the same. Tried them once. Never again.
5908,9,1,0,12/2/2012,"I visited this tourist trap today thinking their cheese steak would be something to write home about. ˜Definitively not the case. ˜This place was horrible and their service was appalling. I should have known my experience was going to bad when I attempted to order a steak sub with wiz and extras. ˜The woman at window said ""we don't carry lettuce, tomato, mayo, etc. ˜You can only get wiz and onions!!"" ˜I ordered two subs and a soda and the total $19!!! ˜What! ˜That's so overpriced for a mediocre sub. While I was eating I recognized something foreign in my sub. ˜A STRAND OF HAIR!!! ˜I immediately took it back up to the counter telling the evil woman I placed my order with earlier about the hair. ˜I demanded my money back. ˜She refused. ˜She said the hair must have been mine because everyone on the staff wears a hairnet. ˜I told her that's crap and she said I would have to find the hair and show her (actually digging through the steak). ˜I refused, yelled, and slammed the sub down on the counter splattering cheese ˜and steak on the inside of their booth window. ˜They didn't like that too much. ˜One of the cooks threw my sub at me and hit me in the arm. ˜What kind of business does that???!!! ˜What type of business are they running? ˜Assaulting people with food. ˜ I will never go back to this place. ˜It's an overpriced tourist trap and with terrible customer service, ˜bland food, and serious disregard for hygiene! ˜I'm happy to add to the growing negative reviews on Yelp. Those looking to have the cheese steak experience while in Philadelphia will be much better off going to smaller, lesser know restaurants. ˜I bet the subs will taste much better and the staff will be courteous."
5909,9,1,0,11/26/2012,"I really wanted to like this place. The food was nothing special, but definitely overpriced for what it was. You would do better at a smaller steak shop elsewhere in town as far as getting a tastier sandwich. Eventually we did. The big turn off for me were the homophobic and racist comments. I thought I was hearing it from another customer standing at an adjacent locaton but when I looked over, the conversation was with what appeared to be a patron and ˜two employees. They were hurling around profanities and hateful words. I guess because Im white and with my wife and child, they felt comfortable to be ignorant, but theymade be VERY uncomfortable in front of my child. I really wanted to speak up but didn't want to have our food spit on. ˜It's one of those places that the tourists have to try out, but the locals would be able to direct you to a better place that is less well known. I just think that the time has come when it is not acceptable to subject people to your brand of hate and they are expected to take it. The old ways dont work anymore."
5910,9,1,0,11/5/2012,"So I had the Geno's vs Pat's comparison and although the food tasted the same it was the service I got at Geno's that SUCKED!! So I went to philly with 2 of my friends and as we were in the 2nd line to get fries the lady there was so rude. I asked for a cheese fries, my friend asked for plain fries, and my other friend just wanted hot chocolate. We all were paying serperatly but she felt that we should have all put our orders in together and actually rolled her eyes in when my friend ordered the hot chocolate. Then I see that 2 fries are ready so I walk up to the window to get what I assume is fries we had ordered and I see her sticking her dirty (money collecting) fingers in the fries to close the tops of it. Then she looks at me and rudely states ""these aren't yours"" and I told her ""Im glad cause I wouldn't want you to be sticking your fingers in them"" which again I got another eye roll. Once we get our fries I go to the ketchup stand and try to pump some ketchup on my fries and she starts yelling at me ""stop pumping the ketchup - there isn't anything in there"" ˜Overall, the owner should fire the old lady with the blonde hair who works at Geno's."
5911,9,1,0,9/30/2012,"This place sucked. There was no menu, ordered a cheesesteak, no onions. They handed me a roll with bland dry beef - about two slices and a cold piece of provolone cheese. No napkins anywhere, which I didn't really need because it was like eating a dry sawdust sandwich. Not one person that waited on me (two different windows) said a word to me other than the amount of the bill. I also wish I could give this no stars. I knew this was a low rent district, but the neighborhood is disgusting, dirt and trash everywhere, and got to watch a dude smoking crack sitting at a red light."
5912,9,1,0,9/3/2012,"Not worth the hype. ˜Steak is dry, cheese wiz was too salty and overall sandwich was too greasy. ˜Had driven 2 hours to try the steak sandwich and was very disappointed. ˜Save your money go else where."
5913,9,1,0,8/9/2012,food wasnt seasoned not enuff cheese high prices doesnt match food qulity. service was not polite and seemed racist
5914,9,1,0,7/27/2012,"Saw this place on TV, so I decided to visit while in Philadelphia. ˜The food was horrible! ˜They give you very little meat, which turned out to be a good thing because it was awful. ˜All these travel shows showcasing this place could not have actually ate there, because they would not be advertising it as one of the best. ˜If you want a real cheese steak, or even a tasty one, go elsewhere."
5915,9,1,0,7/23/2012,Made a special trip to Philly while vacationing in NYC for my own taste test.....ten times over Pat's is better and most importantly....their service was impeccable!!!!! Geno's needs to get rid of that grumpy ole hag taking orders!!!!
5916,9,1,0,7/22/2012,"greasy, cheese is runny, parking is impossible, never can find a place to sit since there is only a handful of benches."
5917,9,1,0,7/21/2012,"I was borned and raised in NE Philly. I took my husband to Philly for the first time to ""enjoy"" a real Philly Cheesesteak. ˜We chose Geno's and we were beyond disappointed, the meat was tough, had no flavor, mushrooms were canned, cold and slapped on top of his sandwich. ˜The customer service was beyond rude, the sandwich was just tossed out the window at us. ˜Their staff definitely needs to go some obedience classes. ˜We won't waste our $20 for 2 sandwiches which he could have cooked better at home. ˜The hype they showed on the Food Network's show with Mike Simon had to be made up, it was nothing like they showed."
5918,9,1,0,7/16/2012,"The sandwich at Geno's was dry, tasteless, the bread was hard, nasty, the cheese had no flavor and overall it was a very, very bad experience. I was so mad! 3 sandwiches were 30 dollars. Damn!"
5919,9,1,0,6/30/2012,Please stay away from this racist dude's sandwich shop. I was excited to come to Philly and try one of these cheese steaks but when i read all the signs and stupid sayings all over their walls it ruined the whole experience. it's really ignorant and disgusting how they wear their racist shirts and try to say its in the name of america. losers i will never buy from you again and i will tell all my friends to avoid your nasty shop.
5920,9,1,0,6/14/2012,"I've lived in the Philly area for 15 years and have eaten numerous cheese steaks. ˜Some friend from NY State visited and they wanted an original cheese steak. ˜We chose Geno's over Pat's. ˜It was embarassing. ˜Tasteless and overpriced. ˜Like many other reviewssaid, it is a tourist trap. ˜Don't go there or to Pat's."
5921,9,1,0,5/6/2012,"Don't fall for the hype. ˜Found Geno's and Pat's to be the worst cheesesteaks I have ever tasted. ˜Extremely long line, rude staff, greasy pile of seasoned wood chips, and the nerve to charge 9.00 for this disappointing experience. ˜The worst cheesesteaks that I've ever had, tasted way better than both Pat's and Geno's. ˜I would understand better if they competed for the ""worst tasting cheesesteaks""."
5922,9,1,0,5/5/2012,"OVERRATED. ˜I'm from philly, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days!! lol. ˜Seriously, the only time I eat from Pats or Genos is when Im drunk off my ass and its 3 in the morning, otherwise, these places get way too much hype, its a f****** tourist attraction. ˜You can get a way better cheese steak from a corner takeout place AT A MUCH CHEAPER PRICE! ˜I can't believe that so many people actually pay almost $10 for an average cheese steak. ˜Once again... I hardly go here, its usually out of desperation because after the club lets out no1 is open and this is a drunk's man's hungry option"
5923,9,1,0,4/30/2012,"Myself and 4 co-workers were in Philly yesterday,4/25/12, for a meeting. We asked where the best Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches were in Philly. SOOO disapointed in what we received. A nice piece of bread with under cooked diced onions, 2 slices of cheese and a couple slices of over cook beef. This was less meat then a bologna sandwich has on it. After everything we were told and seen on Diners Driveins and Dives. The sandwhich that we received was less then 1/3rd as seen on the TV show. DO not waiste your time. We drove from Maryland. The service was great, product not so."
5924,9,1,0,3/9/2012,i am still offended by their sign sais they wouldnt serve anyone who dont speak english..how ignorant. tacky..therefore I pass
5925,9,1,0,2/22/2012,Any corner pizzeria in South Philly will have a better steak then this. Overhyped garbage.
5926,9,1,0,2/11/2012,"How do you say ""Your Sanwiches Suck"" in Spanish? Really for a guy who is really proud to be an American he certainly is shaming us with sub par product. I ordered mine in English and I got a big wet sloppy piece of mierda that all the ketchup in the world couldn't help. Do us Americanos a favor and move to a third world country so we don't have to claim you as one of our own."
5927,9,1,0,2/4/2012,"We came out to the east coast from California in search of some great food. ˜After a weekend in New York, we headed to Philly just for the cheesesteaks. ˜After hearing extensively about Geno's and Pat's, we decided to walk the 2 miles from our hotel through 35 degree weather and 30 mph winds to flavor what was supposed to be the best steaks in the city. ˜What a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! ˜Not only were the cheesesteaks from both places not very good, but the service was just awful! ˜We arrived at Geno's only to discover there was NO INDOOR SEATING. ˜Um, of I realize most of you locals probably knew this already, but when you're from out of state, you kind of expect there to be indoor seating in an east coast city in the middle of JANUARY!!!! ˜It would make sense right? I mean the average temperature there is like the mid 30s! ˜Well, there isn't any. ˜To top it all off, the service was awful. ˜We were treated so rudely by the two staff members who took our order and served us our cheesesteaks that we wouldn't have considered returning even if the sandwiches were good...and let me assure you, they were not. ˜After sampling both cheesesteaks we were so dissatisfied that we decided to try another from the Flyers Arena ˜at Wells Fargo Center. ˜The sandwiches we had there were SO much better....exactly what I expected from a trip to Geno's....stay away both Geno's and Pat's...they are not what you expect out of a Philly."
5928,9,1,0,1/29/2012,"Rude service, Fatty meat. ˜Northeast Philly has the best cheese steaks in Philly! ˜Genos and Pats suck. ˜They prey on tourist that don't realize they are giving them grissly meat. For people looking for a real Philly Cheese steak check these places out: 1. Steves Prince of Steaks 2. Wit Or Wit Out 3. Chinks 4. Jim's"
5929,9,1,0,1/20/2012,"Awful, Appalling are the two adjectives that come to mind when I think of Gino's. The overt racism/xenophobia is a bit much, but hey if the food is good some things can be overlooked; However, this abomination was worse than Subway! If you were ever forced to consume a steak-umm as a youngster, imagine having to wait 20 minutes in line for it. Philadelphians should be ashamed of this place and do everything and anything in their power to shut it down."
5930,9,1,0,1/18/2012,"The truth is you can get a better CheeseSteak for half the price at any corner Pizza shop, Geno's is just to trap out of towners which is sad, so if you're coming to Philadelphia try somewhere else Geno's is giving us a bad name"

5932,9,1,0,10/30/2011,"To pre-empt the local naysayers and their ""Oh, just another tourist"" comments; I grew up just outside the Philly area for 36 years. Although I live on the west coast now, I dearly miss all that is sacred to my past life; italian hoagies, questionable street corner soft-pretzels, boardwalk slices, NJ grease trucks and... the daddy of it all, PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS! It is not a culinary art to this... chopped beef, American, Provolone or Wiz, optional FO, peppers, mushrooms, etc. all sandwiched into that unmistakeable South Philly roll. Fast forward to the other day... My wife and I are packed and ready to get out to the east coast for our annual visit. We were excited to see family and old friends, but what we jokingly talk about and look forward to all year is catching up with our favorite foods. We vowed to have a cheesesteak in our hands within a short time of landing at PHL! We pick up the car and jet up ˜to Passyunk & 9th ASAP. ˜She had never been any further down in the past than Jim's on South so we decide to get one of each and let her decide what she likes. We park, mosey up to Pat's, order an American, get a good-old grumpy smile, ""Thanku!"" and move on. On to Geno's; oohs and ahhs for all the neon, it used to never get old to see. Joey was always proud of his palace! We step up, pay for a Wiz Cheesesteak with FO and then step to the side to the condo-counter. Yeah, now here it comes... Needing a quick squirt of ketchup I get in line with one other patron with no one else behind me. So while standing there, mind you as a paying customer of both establishments, the older woman at the second window leans out and screeches ""Oh no, don't use that ketchup!"" Our little line freezes like she was trying to tell us the ketchup was bad, empty, etc. NO, it was not the case, she proceeds in saying towards the man in front of me ""Oh no, not you sir, you're fine, get what you need."" Then pointing her finger out the window and waving her hands around ""You, I mean you, get outta' here with that crap!"" ˜In front of my wife; ˜a first and last time customer, in front of dozens of patrons; adults and children, in front of police officers on the corner, now taking interest in me like I was causing this... (Huh?) She says again ""I said get outta here with that crap, you don't use our counter, get back across the street."" In my disbelief I ask her if she was joking and proceeded to explain I just bought a Geno's steak 30 seconds prior. Nothing, same stonewall, same yelling. I ask for a manager to come out, an older gentleman sticks his head out the window and yells ""Are you friggin' deaf, leave!"" ˜Now the grill boys and back of house staff crowds to the windows and doorways with the same malice. I admit it; I then yelled back, I cursed, I was furious, I was insulted and I was humiliated in front of my wife and strangers. The curses follow me as I get off the curb and walk away back to Pat's past the gauntlet of keenly interested boys-in-blue. I do not care what your schtick or marketing gimmick is... I do not care that times are tough and budgets are tight... I do not care that you might have been having a tough year... No matter what ones company does it all boils down to customer service. It does not matter if they are shrouded in filthy rags buying a $2 whiskey shooter or in Oscar de la Renta buying their third Mercedes; each and every customer deserves every bit of dignity and respect as the next. No exceptions, even if you have to lie through your teeth while holding your nose because of their smell... All are treated with respect. This establishment did not show that they knew and/or cared to exhibit this very basic business practice. If so, I would have completely understood that ""No Outside Food or Drink"" meant more than just someone sitting at their tables eating a ham sandwich. We did not intend to even sit at their tables. I had done the same action for decades before without this consequence. She could have politely, privately and/or quietly asked me to move on, it actually means their condiments also. ˜ In retrospect now that we reflect on the actual consumption of each steak safely back at Pat's tables, my wife honestly remarked that the Geno's Steak bread was so-so and the ""fried"" onions she ordered with it were closer to the side of raw than the latter. My Pat's American with FO was enjoyable despite the incident, I tore thru it and then a second reorder in five minutes. The roll was soft, the onions and beef seemed fine; but I can't honestly give my latest review of a Pat's steak with certainty, ˜I just wanted to get out of the area as quick as possible; I was humiliated and my wife was deeply embarrassed. All due respect to the late Mr. Bento, I apologize if I slighted your house. But I am deeply disappointed that a company believes they can treat anyone in this manner for any reason. All this over 9/10ths of a cent worth of ketchup..."

5934,9,1,0,8/28/2011,"Their racist and ethnocentric ways will make them fall. I walked by Geno's yesterday, about 4-5 people near Geno's while across the street at Pat's the line was literally around the corner 150 people at least. As for your 'please speak english, this is america'... how about ""Please speak the language you want---This is America, not England"""
5935,9,1,0,8/25/2011,"Shameful how bad they treat foreign customers. Go to Tony Luke's, they promote and support charities ""Eat For Peace"" and another anti-addiction one. Not only that, Pat's across the street is much better!"
5936,9,1,0,8/24/2011,"Horrible! I've had better in New Jersey! This establishment oozes racism. Between the signs that read ""Give us our country back"" and ""This is America speak English"". ˜It's just a total mess. That's no way to run a business."
5937,9,1,0,8/17/2011,"I had high expectations when we went to Geno's. The people were rude, and it wasn't busy when I was there. The cheesesteak had onions and cheese that was all. My husband wanted fries, had to order at another window, and they were like $4, way to pricey and they were lukewarm. I was very dissappointed by what we got. I will stick with our cheesesteaks in Balto. Capt. Harvey's has them totally beat!"
5938,9,1,0,8/5/2011,"I am sitting at Genos at this very moment, eating the absolute worst excuse for a cheese steak. ˜This tastes like microwaved crap, on spongy bread, topped with canned onions, and horrible cheese whiz, served to me ˜by the rudest counter person, that mumbled to me because her mouth was full of food while taking my order. ˜This will be my last time wasting my money here. ˜Off to get take away from the place across the street, for later when my stomach heals from this culinary attack."
5939,9,1,0,7/18/2011,"Don't support racist establishments. I went here with my sister and her boyfriend (who is Mexican) a few years ago. We we went up to order, the staff would not even acknowledge my sister's boyfriend's presence, wouldn't make eye contact with him, didn't listen to him when i tried to order. Also, their decor is cheesy, it's like a Joe's Crab Shack in the middle of surburbia."
5940,9,1,0,7/8/2011,"There's a sign there that reads: This Is AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING Please 'SPEAK ENGLISH'. That's so rude, a place like that deserves zero stars."
5941,9,1,0,7/6/2011,"Go to Pats acroess the street, even though it's only slightly better.. ˜This place is racist, rude, and the food sucks. ˜The meat is stored in water, already cooked for who knows how long, and every ingredient is from a can. ˜It's probably because of such a high volume of people that they found ways to cut the corner... but it cost them the quality of they're food."
5942,9,1,0,7/1/2011,Terrible service. Subpar ˜food. A complete waste of time.
5943,9,1,0,6/22/2011,"Geno's was highly recommended to us when our friends heard we were going to visit Philadelphia. ˜We actually asked a truck driver in the area what he would recommend and his comment was that the lunch wagon parked behind him probably had better sandwiches, but was not as well publicized. ˜We wanted an adventure, though, so we walked the 15 city blocks from our hotel and went to Geno's. ˜ First, they should tell you that you have to order in a secret language. ˜If you order a steak sandwich with provolone and onions, the person taking the order rolls his eyes and mutters, ""Provolone wit/"" then looks back at you as though you're an idiot. ˜ Also, as stated by previous reviewers, the service is rude. ˜I asked for one sandwich with and one without, received both with, and was given even fouler looks with I had the temerity to actually expect them to fix the mistake. ˜And then all they did was take the meat off, put different meat on, and hand me back the sandwich with onions all over the roll and melted cheese. But all of that could have been overlooked if the sandwich was one of those eye-rolling, face squinching, wonderfully delicious bits of heaven that we are sometimes lucky enough to consume. ˜The sandwich was...a sandwich. ˜No more, no less. ˜I have made better tasting sandwiches at home. ˜The meat had very little seasoning (it actually tasted like they boiled the meat with no salt or pepper and definitely no other seasoning). ˜The roll was nice, but again, it was just a roll. ˜I was lucky enough to have ordered onions, because that gave the sandwich a little flavor. ˜Unfortunately, my husband and I had been walking all over Philadelphia all morning and were really hungry. ˜I ate enough that I was no longer hungry and the rest went into the trash. ˜ I will say that the birch beer was fabulous, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant (diner? shack?). ˜I did actually think that perhaps we came on a bad day, but after reading the other reviews, I have a feeling that the great tasting sandwich reviews are the exception, rather than the rule."
5944,9,1,0,6/20/2011,"You can order a ""pizza-steak"" at this dump,but since ""Joey""wants you to order in English,what word would replace ""pizza""?...after all,pizza isn't an English word....""flat-steak""??? ˜I'll go somewhere with a little class..."
5945,9,1,0,6/19/2011,"I went to Geno's years ago and genuinely enjoyed my sandwich and the assembly-line style service. ˜Since then, the food and service have gone down the toilet. ˜They are so preoccupied with moving the line that they won't ask questions or listen to you--they throw disgusting cheez whiz sandwiches (with RAW onions!) at you regardless of what you ask for. ˜Since I have a dairy allergy, I totally wasted my money and since I had already paid, they completely ignored me. ˜Everything about the place says ""Screw you if you don't conform"" so if I hadn't previously had a good experience I would never have come to Geno's. ˜Even the fries are disgusting. ˜Please, stay away."
5946,9,1,0,5/25/2011,"In short - Total Waste of Time. Over priced, overrated, embarrassing South Philadelphia clown show. $9 sandwich is a total ripoff, is really about a $4 sandwich. Don't waste your time, Tony Luke's or Jim's is much better. I noticed the signs requiring you order in English, interesting considering the people who took my order behaved illiterate and had a weak command of the English language themselves."
5947,9,1,0,5/24/2011,"This was the worst Cheese Steak I tasted in Philly. If you are from Philly, you do not go here, unless you are pissy drunk in 2:30 in the morning. ˜Also, they are too expensive. ˜Off the cheesesteak topic, I also don't like how they have treated some Philly citizens. ˜However, they have the best marketing team!"
5948,9,1,0,12/30/2010,"Why would anyone go to this place is beyond me. ˜We went since this was recommended by the show man v food. We were disappointed. The food at any Subway is better. The service is better at a street vendor in NYC. The whole support the military is a gimmick. The staff is primarily losers who did not make it in the military. When I pressed one for his last unit, the faker was exposed and got angry. I am in the military and I am miffed that they use the 'support the military' to get customers Stay away from this place and go across the street or any place else. I am sick and tired of people using support the military to get business They are not pro america, they are just liars"
5949,9,1,0,11/29/2010,"I would rather pay $10 to eat dog shit in a roll than to support Geno's ever again. Myself being a Philly native who has given each and every cheesesteak establishment in the city at least 2 chances, Geno's is the only one that disappointed on both tries. This place needs Vegas style flare to sell a piss poor product. Don't be fooled by the glitz and glamor steaks here are small, bland, and terrible. I wouldn't wish that on anyone who really wants the true Philadelphia cheesteak experience. Whats even more pathetic than the sandwich are the employees. Rude, obnoxious people who serve you like you should be honored to be eating their food. No thanks,skip this shithole."
5950,9,1,0,11/26/2010,"I don't know what is more disappointing, the sub-par food at Geno's or the fact that the Food Network and Travel Channel keep airing the ""rivalry"" between Geno's and Pat's. Too bad I noticed the signage after ordering my food, otherwise I would have walked away. ˜Call me fussy, but I really don't like to be yelled at while ordering my food, and having food shoved in my hand. ˜Sorry, I didn't brush up on my Geno's ""lingo"" and I said my order all wrong...I should be publicly flogged for that transgression. Keep your politics to yourself, and just be polite to your customers. ˜Funny, how something so fundamental is missing at this tourist trap! If you are really looking for a good sandwich try SOS (Subs on South), plus they will ""happily take your order in any language."""
5951,9,1,0,11/19/2010,"FML for ever trying this place!!!! ˜ I swear to you, I was so disappointed when I took my first bite of the steak sandwich, I wish I had brought my own philly steak sandwich to philly from los angeles.. ˜Truely the worst sandwich let alone steak sandwich I have tasted in my life.. ˜My 2 year old son's cheese and crackers taste ten times better and you know why?? ˜Because at least the cheese has flavor.. ˜The meat in the steak sandwich had absolutely zero falvor; even after adding their crapy hot sauce I couldn't make it palatable... ˜Besides the sandwich being terrible, their crapy attitutde was another issue.. ˜I wouldn't mind if they were proud of having a great tasting sandwich and they showed it but for having such a messed up piece of cardboard, they're way over their heads.... ˜ The only time you should ever find yourself at Geno's in Philly is when you're passed out drunk and someone dumps your body on their benches.. ˜That's all I have to say about this Las Vegas wanna be nightmare...."
5952,9,1,0,11/14/2010,"Best cheesesteaks in Philly? A definite NO. I've found more flavor in a microwave sandwich. In combination to the unappealing food you've got the unappealing ""staff"" who acted like they just hate their customers. Combine the last element a gawdy right wing ""God bless America and nowhere else"" element made the whole experience unpleasant. Seriously they had ""freedom fries"" on the menu. I must have fallen into a time warp because apparently it was 2003 there. Also, I'm from the US and I really wanted to order in German just to make them angry over the ""speak American"" sign. I like my fast food to come without a political message being forced down my throat. Geno's is a long lined, unfriendly, overtly political, tourist trap serving overpriced and bland food. Also if you are a foreign tourist, or have some difficulty speaking English I'd check to make sure they didn't spit in your food. Best part of Geno's? Leaving Geno's and resolving never to return."
5953,9,1,0,10/17/2010,"Geno Cheesesteaks had been one of the most profitable food business for many years, their steaks are delicious in taste and fast in convienience. how ever my last attempt to fullfil my hungry stomach a while ago had been the worst experience of service i have ever seen, i was harrased, and emotionaly injured, and extremely dissapointed with the way Geno treats their customers It was a wednesday late night around 3AM, my friends and I went to Genos purely on my suggestion that it was the best food in town. when i went in line to order a serving of cheese fries, one of the staff member took my 10 dollar bill and and told me it would be a minute before my fries were ready, I was expecting my change right away so i can be free from waitting and go sit with my friends. when i asked for my change, the first staff ignored me completely and went about her business, and another middle aged woman who was also a staff stood next to the cheese dispenser and told me "" just wait, no body is gonna steal your money."" - mocked me with the most disrespecting tone any one can dream of. two minutes later, the other staff member returned to the cash register and proceed to give me my change. suprisingly i was only given 1 dollar and 25 cents back after i given them a 10 dollar bill. the female employee who was just harrasing me before began to question my claim and as im stating that i clearly gave the other employee a 10 dollar bill. finaly they realized i did give them the amount i spoke of and gave me my change. the event above are 100 % true with no fabrication of anykind. i dont know about other Geno customers, but i personaly felt racialy discriminated and attacked by the way geno employee handle their maners and respect, i based this on the countless of talks where they send their customers to the back of the line if the customer had trouble speaking english. One thing Geno cheesesteak can count on is that they will never get my business again and ill tell every single soul i talk to in this city about the fact i just spoke of."
5954,9,1,0,10/4/2010,"I was startled by the horrific, racist stickers all over this place and believe they are Anti-American. If you order food in an accent, you may not even be served! This is despicable. By the way, JOE, ˜the US government and the United States DO NOT have an official language and your grandparents could speak English either. By the time the nasty cheesesteak came out, I was not hungry because of the hellish atmosphere of this place. Cheesesteaks are food. It is not necessary to have a racist, Republican montage of images everywhere, reminding people why Americans have a bad reputation in the world. Serve your dead, hormone-ladened cows. Leave the rhetoric out."
5955,9,1,0,8/20/2010,"I haven't eaten here in a while but, of all the truly bad & foul-tasting steaks that I have ever had, Genos wins first prize! I'll take Pats over Genos any day but, Genos AND Pats are the two most overrated steak joints in the entire city of Philly! Their prices are out of whack for something that you can get elsewhere that tastes better (With Genos that is a massive understatement, with Pats that is just true!), at a better price, and you probably won't have to drive as far to get it! They are the two most famous places, no doubt...so, if you are flamboyant, like Perez & Paris Hilton and you want flash over substance then go here and waste your money!"
5956,9,1,0,8/11/2010,"This is the worst steak and cheese I've tried and I've had many. I've had much better ones in no name joints in Boston. But the real reason why I wanted to write the review is because I was honestly shocked at how racist this place is. It's actually quite disturbing and I'm glad that other people are mentioning it also. Geno's has stickers on windows that say ""speak english when ordering.. this is america."" Shocked? How about the picture on the front with accusations against Mumia.. Don't eat here. Your money will be better spent elsewhere."
5957,9,1,0,8/8/2010,"My family and I were visiting Philadelphia when we saw Geno's featured on a T.V. show while in our hotel room. Trying the iconic Philly cheese-steak sandwich was part of our plans and the show sold us on Geno's. What a disappointment! It was overpriced (over $8 a sandwich), barely any meat, which by the way was tasteless, and the fries and drinks were also ridiculously priced. My family felt robbed. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY! We later noticed that what the street vendors were selling was more appetizing looking than Geno's. The only plus was the quick service--quick to take your money!"
5958,9,1,0,8/6/2010,"These people were pretty rude. The lady taking the orders just stares at you like you are an idiot. I really don't understand why they are racist either. This sandwich had crummy cheese wiz as it tasted like it was water downed. Pat's is way better, with at least 2 times the amount of meat, actually puts cheese on your sandwich, and it is 50 cents cheaper! The people there are also nicer and more pleasant to be around. Pass Geno's by and head across the street!"
5959,9,1,0,8/6/2010,"This was a little expensive but well worth it. ˜I told my Mexican/American friend that I would pay for all her drinks and dinner that night if she would just order her Geno's sandwich in Spanish. I'm lame and only speak English. She almost didn't do it but trust me it was hilarious. These guys are so racist it shouldn't be that funny, but it was. At first they just looked at each other and acting like they didn't hear her so she repeated herself. After that came the yelling and get off the sidewalk. Yeah we couldn't even be on the sidewalk in front of their store. Yo I don't know if you think this is your kind of entertainment but if you are in Philly and want to experience true modern day racism don't use English while ordering at Geno's oh and call them french fries they just love that too. Peace!"
5960,9,1,0,7/27/2010,A BIT OVER HYPED..AND PAT'S..BUT IF YOUR IN PHILLY..I GUESS THESE ARE THE PLACES TO COME AND SEE for tourist..MY BAD.wasn't that good..my philly friends laughed at us when i told then that we went to try pat's and geno's...lololol..just was not good!! sorry. OVER HYPED BY TV (FOOD NET)...ONE MORE THING MAKE SURE YOU CAN READ AND SPEAK ENGLISH!!!lololololoolololollol TO ORDER.
5961,9,1,0,7/26/2010,"I want to Genos this weekend after hearing how good these cheesesteake were. I was so dissapointed. I ordered the cheesestake with wiz. It tastes ike dry roast beef with cheese. The roll tasted like it was from Wawa. I could've made this sandwich at home. The people taking my order was nasty!! I asked my boyfriend when we got to the window what he wanted and the nasty woman thought thinking for 3 seconds took too long so she said in a nasty voice to the people behind us ""next"" I felt like going to Genos inconviced her because she ˜had to do her job. We then had to go on another line to order fries and drinks. The woman at this window wasn't a ray of sunshine but not as ˜nasty. Overall I would not come back here because of the terrible cheesesteak and unfriendly help. This place is too hyped up. The next day I went to Tony Luke's. O.M.G the cheesesteak was so juicy and the meat was tender. I ordered it with wiz. It looked about a foot long and cost 7.25. Genos was maybe 6 iinches and and was 7.75. Tony's was amazing no wonder I had to wait 1 hour. Genos I waited 1 min in line. If your looking for the best philly cheesesteake go to Tony Lukes you will not be dissapointed."
5962,9,1,0,6/21/2010,I HATE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!! Chink's is better.
5963,9,1,0,5/11/2010,"I moved to Philly in 2003 and did not try Geno's until this past year. ˜I don't know why I took so long to try it, but I was definitely not missing out on anything. ˜The cheesesteak tasted like cardboard drench in oil. ˜No, scratch that. ˜That gives the impression that the meat was actually moist. ˜It tasted more like cardboard that had oil brushed onto it. ˜ My friends had a try of the meat and told me that Geno's must've been having an off day because it usually wasn't that bad, but seriously, how can any eatery let their standards sink so low? ˜I wish I could give negative stars because I feel robbed. ˜ Never coming back."
5964,9,1,0,3/30/2010,"Here's why you shouldn't go to Geno's Steaks. Of course there was the controversy over the sign posted a couple of years ago requiring customers to order in English and there was a lot of back and forth about this being offensive, possibly discriminatory or a violation of the owner's right to free speech (if only the general public really understood what the right to free speech meant, ugh). Anyway, the owner of Geno's (Joe Vento) led a recent trip with a tour company called Conservative Tours. The company is designed to appeal to more conservative minded folks (no real problem with that, but a little odd considering the group most likely consists of those who are white, correct me if I am wrong). Well this group recently visited Italy led by Joe Vento, owner of Geno's Steaks and the mastermind behind the sign mentioned above about ordering in English at his place of business. Well, word on the street is that Mr. Vento ordered his food in Italy in English or tried to. He had the help of an interpreter when English was not understood by whomever was taking his order. Mr. Vento was also handing out T-shirts to Italians and guests of his tour with his famous slogan about ordering in English. Is this guy that out of ˜touch that he believes that others should be required to place their orders in English at his establishment, but that he can visit another country (where English is not the native language) and that it's okay for him to not order in that country's language? Yes, he is completely out of touch, out of his mind and beyond hypocritical. Why do the words conservative and hypocrisy always seem to work so well together? Go to Pat's across the street. The steak is better anyway. Geno's may have more flash and more lights, but that is just another example of this man's extraordinary ego. I have always liked the idea that ""less is more"" plus I would not intentionally patronize an establishment owned by someone who would display such arrogance by demanding something of others that he could not produce himself. Imagine going to Italy wearing that t-shirt and then not even attempting to follow his own belief. Italians shouldn't have to take his order in English especially when they are not welcome to place their order in Italian at his restaurant. Oh, I forgot, it is the Mexicans (or those that speak Spanish) that he was really addressing with that sign. Discrimination and hypocrisy at its finest. Also, I heard the Italians laughed at the t-shirts and thought the guy was a total joke (and not the good kind)."
5965,9,1,0,3/9/2010,1 word YUCK
5966,9,1,0,1/21/2010,I can't believe the city keeps promoting this dump. Geno's was good fifteen years ago. I don't ˜even think they are in the to twenty now days. The owners heavily ˜advertise but their product is sub-standard. Pat's steaks who are the original inventors of the cheese steak is much better and cleaner
5967,9,1,0,1/17/2010,"This is a total tourist trap. I feel bad that some tourists only go here and that's their lasting impression of a real Philly cheesestaek. The steaks are not prepared fresh, they are already wrapped and ready to hand over the counter (don't even expect a smile, these guys are the dourest you'll find anywhere). Basically you get a crap roll, a flat piece of ""steak"" and a ton of cheese wiz. I'd call it the McDonalds of cheesesteaks, but that would be an insult to McDonalds. Go to any other local steak joint and you'll get the real thing, this place is just crap, I work on South Street, there are probably a dozen better options within 5 blocks of my job, and...wait for it....they make your steak fresh to order!!!"
5968,9,1,0,1/16/2010,"Tourist trap. The owner is a racist and their steaks taste like ass. If you have a brain, you'd go elsewhere."
5969,9,1,0,12/18/2009,Yuk. I was so turned off by the rude staff and stupid racist signs they had that I just took one bite of what looked like steamed rubber and threw it in the trash. It looked and tasted like a heart attack. I don't know how bad of a food you must be used to eating to enjoy this greasy rubber looking hot mess that they serve. I would not even feed this to my dog so I definitely don't recommend this for any other human being.
5970,9,1,0,12/4/2009,take a pass and go to jims on south street. ˜the xenophobic crap is offensive and free mumia.
5971,9,1,0,9/19/2009,"Awful! ˜All the hype is for nothing! ˜Save your time and $8. ˜Find out where the locals eat, it's definitely not here."
5972,9,1,0,8/9/2009,"I was recently in Philly for the UFC show and decided to stop by Genos. I can flat out say that was easily one of the worst cheese steaks I have ever eaten in my entire life. There was nothing special about it other than the long line and the 45 minute wait. The steak had no flavor, it was cold, the cheese wasn't even close to melted and the slices of meat weren't to far off from steak um's quality. I was greatly disappointed. I ended up getting a better cheese steak at the downtown Marriott. ˜I would give Geno's a negative rating if Yelp had the option.. Don't fall into the tourist traps!!!!! IMO Philly Cheese Steaks are vastly overrated and you can find a good cheese steak just about anywhere in this country."
5973,9,1,0,7/20/2009,To make a long story short. The place is gaudy (neon sign) and bigots. The sandwich is only famous because of celebs.There is no flavor or taste outside of the cheese whatsoever! I asked for the works and they put some barely fried onions on it! What a joke! Garbage totally. I'll try Pat's next time but I can get a better cheese steak from my local Italian pizza joint. I'm glad I finally went because I wanted to know what the hype was about but there really is none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!
5974,9,1,0,6/11/2009,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE The worst cheese steak sub I have ever tasted....... My family and I drove from Baltimore to Philidelphia to eat this sub.

All the lights and carnival attractions took us to Genos. WHERE's THE BEEF!!!!!!!. My goodness what a joke. Could not believe it. I was so embarrassed. My family asked togo home to EAT. Disappointed. theywere so hungry.After spending 7.50 and 1.50 for a drink for each of us Iwas broke. Tolls too. you know . Anyway Pats was better ,but come to Baltimore and eat a Filetties ˜cheese steak sub I promise you you will not be disappointed. $4.75. and you can make 2 subs out of 1. So much beef . dDelicious."
5975,9,1,0,9/20/2008,"Pat's or Geno's..Geno's or Pat's - the real winner is you, if you avoid both altogether. ˜The place is disgusting, as you get closer to the place you wonder if you're going to be swarmed by rats, then when you're up against the shack, the grease overwhelms you. ˜Of course, if you're still able to eat after seeing the place, the food will knock you out."

What a waste of time, it was ""customer appreciation day"" like anyone wants to listen to that clown suckin up to joey vento and playing oldies music. The food was crappy and scrappy. There was almost no meat and the cheese was hardly melted. Ive had better at subway. He should really change the name of the place to genos world famous best philly breadwich because thats all there was too it. Dont waste your time at that dump and go to quiznos."
5977,9,1,0,6/19/2008,"This place is foul. Not only is their food god-awful, the people who work there suck too. Go to Tony Luke's if you want real food, and a great cheesesteak. If you are in that area, go to Pat's instead. It's not top-notch but it's a thousand times better than that terrible excuse for a food place Geno's. I feel disgusting just writing about it."
5978,9,1,0,7/28/2007,"I tried this place once and will never go back again. ˜The cheesesteaks are overpriced and mediocre at best. ˜You can get a better cheesesteak, plus a can of soda and chips, for $5 from any street vendor, while Geno's charges $7 for just the sandwich. ˜Plus, there is very little meat on the sandwich and it is not that flavorful. Price and mediocrity aside, the owner is obviously a major jerk. ˜""Order in English"" signs are all over the place, and he actually sells T-shirts that say it, too. ˜Now, keep in mind that Geno's is a MAJOR tourist attraction. ˜Tour buses routinely stop there because it is such a legendary place (don't ask me why.) ˜Many of these tourists are visiting from other countries and probably do not speak English very well, if at all. ˜Anyone who goes out of his way to make a major portion of his customer base feel unwelcome certainly does not deserve to be patronized and raised to iconic status, especially when his food sucks. Finally, I agree that those who immigrate to this country should learn to speak English. ˜However, I am also aware that learning a new language, especially a difficult one like English, takes a bit of time. ˜I am sure that even the great Joe Vento's parents took at least a year to become reasonably conversant. ˜ ˜ If he seriously wanted people to learn to speak English, he would take down the ""order in English"" signs and instead post signs advertising the local English language instruction center - you know, signs that actually inform people where to go to learn English instead of simply demanding that they do so."
5979,9,2,0,10/19/2014,"This has to be the worst and most expensive cheesesteak I have ever had my entire life, I can make a better one without even trying. I do not recommend this location to any tourist or anyone who has been told they are ""good"". You can go to any local corner store (papi store) and get a cheesesteak and fries (that taste 10x better) for literally half the price of one cheesesteak without Cheez Whiz at Geno's. This place is waaay tooo pricey."
5980,9,2,0,10/16/2014,Geno's is like the old man river's version of cheese steak and Pat's is like the greatest heaven on earth.. I could never see in passing up Pat's cheese steak for anything.
5981,9,2,0,10/7/2014,Just okay...parking is hard....it is kind of dirty...it's better if you go to a food chain/restaurant. Save your money and go experience a Philly cheese steak elsewhere to avoid disappointment.
5982,9,2,0,9/26/2014,its okay nothing to brag about
5983,9,2,0,9/17/2014,Overpriced!!!!!!!!!
5984,9,2,0,9/10/2014,"Just like Pat's, its overpriced and overhyped. ˜Skip both."
5985,9,2,0,9/10/2014,"To sum up my feelings about this place in one word: ""NOPE!"""
5986,9,2,0,9/7/2014,"With all the buzz around having to try a Philly Cheese steak with a side by comparison of Pat's and Geno's I really had much higher expectations. ˜ To be honest I've had better cheese steaks not in Philly so the only big difference which people who live in this area seem to really love is the wit wiz option which is basically that nacho cheese whiz filling which you can get at places like 7-Eleven on your nachos or by melting that Velveeta cheese. ˜Prepare to put on the calories though. The one thing I really enjoyed about this place over Pat's was their bread, it's soft and has a nice chewiness that goes well with the cheese steak however I found their steak meat to be overly dry and not as flavorful as Pat's. I wouldn't return here in the future, I've had my side by side comparison and satisfied my earning to see what the buzz was/is all about so my experience is complete. Everything here is ala carte as well, you gotta buy your cheese steak apart from your fries. ˜It's all cash too so at the end of the day for a combo meal you're paying more than $20 for fast food which is ridiculous. P.S. I also had the cheese fries which weren't that good, it's the same cheese whiz they slather in the cheese steak. CASH ONLY."
5987,9,2,0,8/12/2014,"Geno's Steaks - Tourist Trap #1A Tourist Trap #1B goes by the name of Pat's Steaks. Yes these are the two Cheese Steak places that you will see in the Philly Commercials and people around the country associate with Philadelphia. For that reason they can sell what ever they want and people will still line up! aka ""The Tourist Trap"" It bothers me, being a Philly native, that most tourist's think that this is what a Philly Steak is, and they have to eat low grade fatty gristled Crap! Its sad and embarrassing to know that people from around the country, and around the world think that choking on gristle is just part of enjoying a Philly Steak. I'm giving Geno's and Pat's 2 stars instead of 1 because, Hey, at least you get an iconic photo-op in front of the place! Just do yourself a Big favor and eat somewhere else!"
5988,9,2,0,8/8/2014,Totally over-hyped. ˜Tony Luke's does a much better cheese steak.
5989,9,2,0,8/7/2014,"Despite Geno's is very well known, I don't think it's THAT special to stand on the line to try out. ˜To me, it's just one of the typical Cheesesteaks you can get. ˜I didn't get any distinct flavor that differentiates Genos from other restaurants. ˜ If you love cheesesteaks, you can try."
5990,9,2,0,7/13/2014,"Meh, describes this place perfectly. ˜I'm from Philly I know the deal. ˜The food, mediocre at best. ˜There are so many places with better cheesesteaks. ˜So many. So is Geno's cheap? NO! They're actually expensive too! ˜A cheesesteak, fries, soda ˜is gonna set you back $16 ! Now go eat outside! ˜Honestly, I don't know why people keep going here. ˜I guess the bright lights at night attract the drunks, but that doesn't explain the daytime zombies."
5991,9,2,0,6/23/2014,I know this is one of the iconic cheese steak places in Philly... but it always makes me a bit ill. Tastes good going down... its the later that I could live without. Go there once if you must but there are definitely better places to get a great cheese steak
5992,9,2,0,6/22/2014,"Not a friendly staff. One guy behind the counter threatened to ""lay me out like a chump"" when I complained about a rude remark he made to my wife. The sandwich tasted good though."
5993,9,2,0,5/31/2014,over rated garbage!
5994,9,2,0,5/28/2014,"This goes out to everyone who does not live in Philadelphia and is coming to the city to get a ""real"" steak. Do not go to Pat's or Geno's; you can do much, much better in Philly. First of all, the line is always long, and the service is nasty.Secondly, and most importantly, the steaks just aren't that good. It's the truth people. Do a Google search for best cheesesteaks in Philly, and go with one you never heard of. I promise you it will be better than Geno's."
5995,9,2,0,5/15/2014,"If you want a cheese steak at 3 am, you probably won't find any better; however, if you want a cheese steak at 3 am, you may very well not be functioning at 100% brain capacity, so you deserve what you get. If you want a cheese steak at 3 PM, and you find yourself here, you are probably a tourist who is hungry after running up the steps to the Art Museum. Again, you get what you deserve."
5996,9,2,0,5/15/2014,greasy.
5997,9,2,0,5/9/2014,With all of the hype over there cheese steak you would think you'd be getting something at least partly delicious. The customer service sucks and their steaks are dry. I've definitely eaten better and would say save your gas or go across the street to Pat's
5998,9,2,0,5/3/2014,The guy who used to own this place was kind of a creep. ˜I don't giving my money to people I don't particularly like. ˜The food is ok.
5999,9,2,0,3/23/2014,"same as Pats, if you are a tourist go"
6000,9,2,0,3/6/2014,"Heck I don't even know why they're still open I hate to say. I thought the other place was for tourists but this is really a trap for tourists. This place should be embarassed to be serving cheesesteaks. I usually don't like to say too many bad things because who knows it may have been an off day but the meat was cardboard and didn't even taste like they put any salt in it. I mean, bad"
6001,9,2,0,3/4/2014,Pats steaks is much better. service is lousy!!!
6002,9,2,0,2/22/2014,Greasy and unhealthy.
6003,9,2,0,1/26/2014,wayyyyyyy overrated....has the name and hype for tourist but along with pats wayyyyyyy overrated!!!! ˜ dallesandros and mamas pizzeria are wayyyyyyyy better!!!
6004,9,2,0,1/12/2014,Will never go back.
6005,9,2,0,1/4/2014,I dont get all the rave about this place. the meat was tasteless and tough. the people are rude and ignorant. why?? why???
6006,9,2,0,12/3/2013,Meat is kind of fatty and they are not known for their great customer service. You need to know what you want when you get to the front of the line.
6007,9,2,0,11/25/2013,I like pats better
6008,9,2,0,11/21/2013,Is it a cheesesteak? Latest Visit: 10/1
6009,9,2,0,11/21/2013,This place is a tourist trap. ˜No self respecting Philadelphian would eat here unless completely intoxicated. ˜So many better cheese steak to be had in South Philly! ˜And get over yourself- I am a Philly native and refuse to use your asinine slang. ˜If I order a sandwich from you I fully intent to use proper English to describe what I would like despite your eye-rolling.
6010,9,2,0,10/14/2013,I purchased five steak subs and two of them were not what I ordered. There wasn't much meat or cheese on the subs. The meat did not have any flavor.
6011,9,2,0,10/1/2013,Better than Pat's but not worth the $$ or the trip down there!
6012,9,2,0,9/17/2013,"Rude worst customer service. Other than its glitzy lights, nothing is glitzy about this place. The cheesesteak is actually not bad but the people are rude."
6013,9,2,0,9/15/2013,"As a resident of Philadelphia and long time cheese steak enthusiast, Geno's is very over rated. I have had better, way better."
6014,9,2,0,9/4/2013,"what happened to you?! Not only the service has gone down, the food quality and their high caloric cheese steaks aren't good anymore. There washed out."
6015,9,2,0,9/2/2013,"Cheesesteak was good, people that work there are jerks."
6016,9,2,0,8/21/2013,"Nothing to rave about...overpriced cheesesteaks...but hey, at 3 am, its good enough!"
6017,9,2,0,8/11/2013,"Coming from a true south philly resident, This is certainly NOT the best cheese steak in philly. Genos is not even in the top 5. If you want a true philadelphia cheese steak stop by Jim's steaks on south street or Philips steak on 22nd street"
6018,9,2,0,8/8/2013,"Without trying to get into a battle over which one is better, I've been to Geno's and Pat's many times. ˜Both are overpriced tourist traps but I find myself here many times after having a few drinks. ˜Without a doubt, it's obvious that Geno's gives the bare minimum amount of meat in order for it to still taste like a cheesesteak. ˜You're spending 9 dollars on a steak for less than a dollar's worth of meat. ˜The best thing one can possibly do if they find themselves here is to walk across the street to Pat's where you'll get a superior steak."
6019,9,2,0,8/2/2013,"So everyone from Philly knows that no one goes to Geno's (or Pat's for that matter) for a cheesesteak. There are so many neighborhood spots which are more authentic, and these places are set up and operated to attract tourists. Personally, if I have friends over from out of town, I make cheesesteaks for them myself. Fresh steak and provolone, peppers/onions and a good roll from the Italian market (or local south Philly shop) is the best way to go. Anyway, I went here recently with a group and found that pricing has gone up and service/quality of food has definitely declined. Folks behind the counter literally couldn't care less about what they're doing, nor will they ever. They're ""Geno's"". Tables are never wiped down and you're probably going to feel a bit hurt when they give you your total. Expect to pay close to $10 for cheese fries and a soda. Overall, I understand that they are established and they have a certain arrogance about that but they have definitely gotten ruder and more ˜unkempt over the years and it simply doesn't leave a good impression on out of towners."
6020,9,2,0,7/31/2013,I used to go to Genos not any longer long line bad attitudes and pre cooked steaks at $10 a sandwhich there are better places to eat in philly
6021,9,2,0,7/23/2013,"Never understood the hype. Save a drive - cook up some steak-ums in mayo, add some cheewiz and BAM, instant geno's."
6022,9,2,0,7/18/2013,"To be honest I love Jim's steaks and always will...I only came to genos just to see if it was at least on the same level as Jim's ...but of course once again It was waste of my money...just like pats , this place is the McDonald's/Burger King of cheesesteaks!"
6023,9,2,0,7/17/2013,"The steaks were good, but the service is just too rude. ˜I know it's part of the magic, but they take it too far. ˜Parking is not good."
6024,9,2,0,7/4/2013,Geno 's Steaks ˜love the hot peppers ... ˜The atmosphere is ok too especially when the celebrities sneak to get a steak there.
6025,9,2,0,6/25/2013,"To be honest, this place doesn't live up to the hype. Two cheesesteaks and drink will cost you $20. The meat is pretty dry, crowd can be rowdy and irritating if you go late at night. Overall, it's nothing special."
6026,9,2,0,6/24/2013,Both the cheese steak and the freedom fries were not that tasty. I was a bit disappointed.
6027,9,2,0,6/17/2013,I think Geno's is loosing the battle with Pat's. So sad thought
6028,9,2,0,6/13/2013,Don't buy the hype! Over priced and lousy in taste.
6029,9,2,0,6/10/2013,"Geno's has a lot of nerve to say that they have the best cheesesteak in Philadelphia. First of all, the place itself has some issues. For one, there are multiple pictures posted of the founder next to signs saying things such as ""It's America - speak English when you order"" or ""I'm mad as hell; I want my country back."" This turned me off from the place immediately, but I still decided to try their cheesesteak since it is well-known. Because of the popularity of the restaurant, the service is brusque and borders on unfriendly. Now, moving on to the actual food: I noticed two major problems that, together, create a sub-par cheesesteak. First, since they serve so many people, the steak is not cooked to order. You get your food only a few seconds after ordering it. Although this may allow them to serve more customers more quickly, it makes for a cheesesteak that is not nearly hot and fresh enough. Further, the steak is chopped into unusually large pieces. I suppose this must just be how they do it at Geno's, but this customer certainly felt as though it decreased the quality of their product substantially. Had I got this from any old restaurant, I would have just shrugged, made a note that that restaurant doesn't have very good cheesesteaks, and moved on. However, Geno's is widely popular and claims to be the best. I can only understand its popularity by guessing that most of its customers are tourists who don't know any better, and I find its claims to greatness to be, frankly, insulting to one of my favorite foods."
6030,9,2,0,6/3/2013,"Most people who live in and around South Philadelphia don't get cheese steaks from here. ˜It's for the out of townies who don't know better. ˜I would rather walk down to underdog's and get two hot dogs, fries and a drink for under $10, rather than paying almost $10 for this lousy steak. ˜Oh, and the people that work there suck too."
6031,9,2,0,5/26/2013,"not a great steak, ˜one of the worse. ˜i cant believe people wait in lone for it. ˜. ˜they dont chop up the meat so its in big chunk form like frozen steak ums. ˜im guessing the food bugdet goes to the bright lighting and the gmc hummer parked out front then to actual good steak. ˜ ˜ ˜as for the spek english or die sign. ˜ all the people i know that english is their 2nd or 3rd language never want to not speak english when they are purchasing something. ˜its odd that geno's came across this so much they had to put up a sign."
6032,9,2,0,5/16/2013,"Not a fan, overpriced and way too sloppy for my liking."
6033,9,2,0,4/26/2013,"I personally don't really like Geno's and prefer Pats much more. Gino's does not cut up the cheesesteak meat very much (they serve more chunks of meat as opposed to Pats who serves more fine-ground beef). In addition, the staff is pretty rude (especially to tourists) and the food and drinks are definitely over-priced. Nonetheless, it's a classic venue in Philadelphia and I would definitely recommend a visit to it."
6034,9,2,0,4/7/2013,For tourists.
6035,9,2,0,3/10/2013,"We want to Geno's and I was very disappointed. The meat is whole and not chopped like in most cheese steak sandwiches and had no flavor at all. It was also very fatty. However, the bread was very good!"
6036,9,2,0,3/9/2013,Better then pats. Problem is they mass produce cheesesteaks so they are no longer fresh.
6037,9,2,0,12/17/2012,"One of the more famous places to get a cheesesteak in philly, probably one of the worst too. do yourself a favor and skip pat's and geno's. Jim's on south street or Chink's is much better"
6038,9,2,0,11/19/2012,"I came all the way from Maryland because Philly is supposed to have the best cheese steaks. Geno's didn't deliver. The bread was chewy, the sandwich was barely warm, it didn't have much meat in it, and the fries were just ok. The woman at the counter was rushing me, she asked me for my order twice before the customer in front of me even left the counter. ˜It was like a McDonald's for cheese steaks. You probably have to be famous to get a fresh one. It didn't taste bad but I've had better in D.C. I did enjoy all of the pictures and patches though."
6039,9,2,0,5/13/2012,"The most overrated steak place in the city. Its my dads favorite cheesesteak spot but he's from South Carolina so he doesn't know any better lol. ˜Dry, weird looking steaks with bland flavor If you want a real Philly steak go to a pizza store or Max's in North Philly."
6040,9,2,0,3/31/2012,"Having seen this restaurant on TV numerous times as one of the ""musts"" to try when in Phildelphia, I was totally disappointed with the food. Now, don't get me wrong, the cheese steak wasn't horrible, but it is HIGHLY OVERRATED!!! I have certainly had waaaaay better cheesesteaks from sub shops across America. There was absolutely nothing that wowed me!!! I drove almost hour to get a mediocre sandwich with an attitude and nowhere to sit. If you are in the area, stop through and get a descent meal, but DO NOT make a special trip...you will be disappointed."
6041,9,2,0,3/4/2012,"Idk what happened between last year and now. I was anticipating my trip to Geno's, I was already nearby for the annual Flower show. I was disappointed!! The taste was sooo off...the attitude I got from the overly made up lady behind the counter, the stiff fries....I won't be going back there...ever!! ˜Geno's fell off BIG TIME!!!"
6042,9,2,0,1/11/2012,"Me and my fiance' visited Geno's last September. I was the one who dragged him there, since I assumed since I have seen them all over the food network, then it had to be a ""must try"". I enjoyed the wait in line, more than the food. The photos along the walls and inside the covered awning were interesting. However, when it was time to order my food, I had mixed reviews. There are no signs telling you how to order, so I informed the female working at the first window that it was my first time ordering. She responded, ""yeah, I can tell!"" I guess she didn't care about promoting good customer service, since she knew that many unsuspecting customers would be coming to them anyway, with all the publicity they have received. However, when we went to the second window to order our fries and drinks, we conversated with a very nice young man, who helped us finalize our order and even thanked us. He was obviously too young to be jilted by the older employees who could of cared less about anything but making money and getting through the day. As for the sandwich itself, the bun was good, but the steak was disappointing! There was harldy any meat on it and the meat that was there was tasteless! I just assumed there would be an option to have green peppers, mushrooms etc., but no..only onions. We had the fries with cheese. I thought the cheese just ""drowned"" the fries, but my fiance' enjoyed them. So..for us, it was not a good enough experience for us to return. Geno's needs to be thankful (due to publicity/media) that they will continue to have many other folks visit, who like us, did not know any better...until we actually got there!!"
6043,9,2,0,5/19/2011,"Not worth the price or the drive to get there. Have had much better cheese steaks from local sub shops. Save your money. Only good for a 2 am cheese steak,open 24 hrs."
6044,9,2,0,5/7/2011,Bland. Pat's across the street is a little better. Slightly better seasoned. Totally overrated at $9 ea. ˜Wouldn't pay 3$for it.
6045,9,2,0,4/19/2011,"Geno's is the other famous cheesesteak place in Philly. Like I said in my Pat's review, one has better meat, one has better cheese, but I can never remember which is which. It's a great experience and something magical about this particular intersection where the roads intersect. It's like a movie location. I wish I could give more stars, but as far as sandwiches go, it's a little flat (just meat and cheese). However, you gota try it at least once! & order properly..it's ""wit wiz!"" Check the YouTube videos for how to order a Philly cheesesteak without getting laughed at."
6046,9,2,0,3/16/2011,go to pats. ˜way better. its right next to eachother.
6047,9,2,0,2/10/2011,"I was in Philly and had try a cheesesteak. ˜I got a wiz wit from Genos. Gotta tell ya, not too impressed. ˜Maybe it's a victim of hype, I dunno. I could definitely make a better one without too much forethought. Hot sauce was plus to add it."
6048,9,2,0,11/27/2010,Let me just start by saying if you are a Philadelphian you obviously are going to try this place atleast once. However I don't recommend going back more than that. And to be honest with you pat's isn't that much better. so why there is a war between the two places beats me. Looking for a good steak and decent fries? Leave it!
6049,9,2,0,5/20/2010,"I didn't enjoy the cheesesteaks as much as I did from Pat's. The sandwich itself didn't look very appealing and the lady at the counter was a mean bitch. The bread and whiz here isn't as good. The steaks were slightly better but not a huge difference. I had their cheese fries, it was okay. Can't compare it to Shake Shack. Geno's definitely look flashier and nicer from the outside but food wise, it's not that great. Next time I come to Philly, I have to give Jim's a try. I heard theirs is off the hook!"
6050,9,2,0,4/7/2010,"Not at all close to the hype on TV. ˜Went to Geno's as a first ever visit to Philly, but not impressed. ˜The servers were a bit rude and the cheese steak was ok, pretty skimpy on the steak for the price. ˜Get the wiz since otherwise the steak will be dry. ˜One other thing is why two windows one for steak and the other for fries and drinks? ˜What I liked about the place was the speak English sign...totally agree that is something that needs to be said more often."
6051,9,2,0,12/1/2009,"Went out of my way on vacation just to stop at Geno's for a Philly cheese steak. The steak itself was bland and while the taste with the wiz was just OK, I was real disappointed with the lack of steak in the sandwich. Went there expecting a great sandwich and left there looking for something else to eat."
6052,9,2,0,11/29/2009,"Took 4 hours to get there from NYC due to a 20 mile backup on the New Jersey turnpike. ˜Finally get there and it was a short line. ˜Ordered a whiz wit. ˜Both Geno's and Pats are living off of hype, was nothing special about either of them, steak has no flavor, Geno's is really small. ˜Just to say you ate there or if your starving at 3 am is the only reason to go there, i'm sure there are much better places all over Philly."
6053,9,2,0,11/7/2009,"Don't get me wrong, I love philly... But i've had way way better cheese steaks then Genos. ˜Ive had better at a Gas station in philly that had a little kitchen. ˜Im assuming the hype is because of the location, all the lighting on the building, oh and that it was on TV! ˜The food network i think it was? ˜Good business for them from all the tourists though."
6054,9,2,0,9/28/2009,my buddies and i took a road trip across america and geno's and pat's were amongst our stops. least to say i had higher expectations for both.
6055,9,2,0,9/5/2009,"We ordered 2 cheesesteaks from Geno's (while on vacation in Philly, decided to see what all the hype was about). ˜Both with onions, one with cheese wiz and one with provolone. ˜Both were dry and mediocre. ˜I liked that Geno's has hot peppers on their condiments station and they had more seating than Pat's. ˜We also went across the street and bought a cheesesteak with cheese wiz and onions from Pat's to do a taste comparison. ˜Pat's bread seemed fresher and their meat had more flavor. ˜Don't get discouraged when you pull up and see the lines for both places, they churn out service pretty quick and they are very efficient. ˜Overall both places were not bad but not spectacular either. ˜If you decide to try it, go to Pat's, they're much, much better."
6056,9,2,0,7/10/2009,"Seriously overrated after all the press they get, I went but it was okay. Not worth going out of your way for, but if you're in the area and you're hungry the portions are good."
6057,9,3,0,12/27/2014,"After reading many of the reviews-- and having had scores of Geno's steaks over the years, ˜I think the trick is to courteously tell the order taker EXACTLY how you want your steak sandwich! ˜ Yes, ˜the staff are true South Philly types, but despite their ATTITUDE [like some police], if you treat them with great respect- they will accommodate you and eventually actually be nice! I never could understand how anyone could prefer Pat's, across the street... As to their obnoxious, distasteful signs, ˜never could figure that out. ˜ ˜Always thought it might just be a way to gain attention and advertise themselves [which worked, ˜I understand when they first put their anti Spanish signs up, ˜business increased dramatically due to large TV local AND national coverage-- no other logical reason as it clearly must antagonize a lot of people... seems crazy but I guess if you are in tremendous demand you can be as obnoxious as you want. That said, ˜I've never had a Jim's or Tony Luke's, but the reviews seem to say they are better. ˜ I'll try them and let you know."
6058,9,3,0,12/9/2014,"How I heard of this place: We were up in West Chester, PA, briefly, and decided we had to visit with our good friend Samyar before the long traffic-entrentched road trip back to Arlington. Wanting to sample some good ol' Philly Cheesesteak, Samyar recommended one of the two best in Philly: Geno's. So, we made our way to the bright orange, neon signs that made Geno's easily seen from any direction. Type of cuisine: ""Geno's Steaks was started by Joe Vento back in 1966. He figured that if he was going to sell a steak, he had to be where they were already eating them...at the ""X"" shaped intersection of 9th & Passyunk in South Philadelphia. Joe learned the cheese steak business from his father who in the early 1940's opened ""Jim's Steaks"". In 1966, Joe started ""Geno's"" with $6.00 in his pocket, 2 boxes of steaks and some hot dogs."" According to their website, ""The ingredients are simple, exacting and never greasy thinly sliced rib-eye steak, melted cheese, oven-fresh baked bread and delicately grilled onions. Awaiting your piping hot sandwich on the counter outside are ketchup, mustard, relish and Joe's choice hot sauce."" Ambiance: Good thing we were warned while standing in the street, in line for our orders. Samyar let us know that we say, ""One with...(fill in the blank with type of cheese between Provolone, American or Cheese Whiz) and with onions (or without)."" Writing this, now, I also see that Geno's has also enlighted it's website readers, ""Be prepared and know how to order, because the service is fast and the line keeps moving. For example, on a cheese steak with onions, specifiy which kind of cheese you'd like. By the time you have given your order, your money will be taken and your sandwich will e out the window nice and hot! At the next window you can pick up your soda, fries and coffee."" This is no joke! Walking up to the eccentric, slightly overboard signage denoting Geno's from blocks away, over the fenced field housing a community garden, one is immediately inundated with orange. The chest-height, glossy, orange-tiled walls with a blue-tiled stripe, the awning overhead noting: ""Geno's Welcomes You!"" and the orange, plastic picnic tables attached to metallic pillars with an orange cover cannot go unnoticed. While there is no indoor dining, these casual tables find themselves under a canopy on the sidewalk ""for those who wish to enjoy sandwiches on the premises rather than drive off with them"". The condiment bar, a large, chest-height, metal box with an opening on the side facing the order windows, offers Cherry Peppers, Ketchup, Mustard and Relish. Large, locked, glass display cases include badges which ornamented civil service members throughout the years. Everywhere from the walls above the orange tiles to the ceiling can be seen such memorabilia, including plaques in memory and honor of. A Path of Honor lays the foundation in the brick tile-work that leads to the ordering windows from the street corner, in between orange horse-heads set atop metal pillars chained to one another. As we watch, hawk-eyed for a spot at the orange tables, we find one at the far end, closest to the ordering line, and snag it while no one else is paying attention. At the table, on the table, we see numerous photographs, set like a collage, underneath a thick, plexi-glass table surface. Our sandwiches, wrapped in wax paper with the Geno's logo, immediately in front of us, awaiting the first bite. What I ordered: I ordered ""One with Provolone and onions."" Chris seconded. Samyar selected ""One with American and onions."" (Each sandwich: Price $8.33, Tax $0.67, Total: $9.) At the next window, we also placed two orders for Cheese Fries ($4.60 plus $0.40 tax, for a total of $5), a rounded container of thin-cut fries drenched in Cheese Whiz. What I loved: I loved the cherry peppers at the condiment bar, fluffy, juicy and just spicy enough to give a kick, without numbing your taste buds. I also loved the relish, surprisingly. I have never been a fan of relish, especially store-bought, pre-packaged. This relish had larger cut pickles and less of a sweet flavor. I enjoyed the salty, tangy taste of the pickles with the otherwise, slightly dry sandwich. Why I loved it: The bright orange, the casual atmosphere, the large bikers with tattoos the size of my head on each arm working the kitchen line and the scruff woman at the register snapping our orders across the room behind the plexiglass separating us from them, inside. Cost: High ($9 per sandwich, sides extra)"
6059,9,3,0,12/5/2014,"I went to philly a few months ago, and I made sure to check both Pat's and Geno's. Overall, there was very little difference in the two restaurants. The meat, the bread, the cheese. You could easily get a similar or better heesesteak somewhere else. The history of the restaurant doesn't make it any better than a regular cheesesteak."
6060,9,3,0,10/27/2014,I had some cheesesteaks with them. The meat was easy to eat. I got wiz wit.
6061,9,3,0,10/25/2014,I prefer the one i go to now over Geno's anytime I'm in the neighborhood! nothing personal. I just have a picky taste and they do not make a bad one just not what i am used to getting.
6062,9,3,0,10/22/2014,It was good. No complains i enjoyed it
6063,9,3,0,10/4/2014,Does it live up to the D? ;) ...Possibly but the lines are too long :(
6064,9,3,0,9/30/2014,"Good steaks, they might have good quality steaks, but they don't give the most quantity. They offer quick service that makes that long line speed by. Going there on a busy night might mean that you are left standing there eating your steaks"
6065,9,3,0,9/16/2014,"Not the best in Philly, butt definitely the best on the historical corner. Open late, so always an option."
6066,9,3,0,9/9/2014,"Meh, Pat's is better, Jim's on 4th and South is the best. Might be worth driving by when you're in town and snapping some pictures, but that's about it."
6067,9,3,0,9/8/2014,"Geno's Steaks, located at 1219 South 9th Street, in Philadelphia, PA is OK; but I still like sweet peppers on my steaks along with the fried onions (and none of that Cheeze Wiz that many of the ""younger"" generation crave). ˜For the green peppers and onions on the steak, I go to Pat's, King of Steaks, across the street."
6068,9,3,0,9/4/2014,"I've been to both Gino's and Pat's, and they're decent as far as the cheesesteak goes. But I've had better. For whatever that's worth."
6069,9,3,0,8/23/2014,"I was disappointed with Geno's cheese steak. I guess it's just a tourist attraction. I had steak with wiz cheese & onions on bread, nothing fancy and no flavor. I thought at least the onions we've been grilled to give it some flavor. The fries were really good though."
6070,9,3,0,8/17/2014,"Not a big CheeseSteak Fan, but this place is consistently good! Weel done!"
6071,9,3,0,8/17/2014,"Last review for a weekend of reviews: Took some out of town friends here for lunch today. Decent. Pats got a new sign across the street, that people in line in front of us were talking about. Now to the steak.......kind of fatty. Thought ""the chewy fat"" would be cut out while on the grill. The ""wiz"" sauce or actual cheese will have you craving more! Who cares what it is....wow! Will return for sure."
6072,9,3,0,8/15/2014,Staple of philly for tourists but there are plenty of other cheesesteak places that are better.
6073,9,3,0,8/12/2014,"We went at midnight on a rainy Sunday and were the only ones in line. I ordered my cheese steak properly and my order was repeated properly, but came out wrong. I ordered one cheesesteak, whiz, with onion. Didn't get the onion. No big, there was a line by the time I opened it and having worked in similar places like this I wasn't going to complain. I went to get my soda at the next window and stood there for about 2 minutes while an older guy talked to a younger guy, and both of them acknowledged I was there but didn't bother coming up to take care of my order. When the older guy did come up he was still in his conversation and blaming the young guy for not telling him I was there. That ˜was the extent of the experience, now moving onto the food. I had Pat's across the street the day before so I wanted to try a handful of different places during the week. The sandwich itself was really good, but not quite my favorite cheesesteak I've had. There's really not much more to say I guess. There's hundreds of places across Philadelphia to get a good cheesesteak but this one in particular doesn't stand out. It might have warranted a 4 or maybe even a 5 if I had gotten what I ordered and they didn't waste my time so they could chat. I wouldn't expect anything more than standard service and it didn't deliver. ˜ Also, I was a little put off by the whole ""freedom fries"" and ""Speak English because this is America"" stickers. That's somewhat ironic coming from a place that has a huge international tourist following. The freedom fries thing is long past too. I'm as patriotic as the next but that just seemed tacky."
6074,9,3,0,8/5/2014,Place is very expensive Quality of the steak is good but it could be better taste so plain they don't put mayo on your sandwich for you which sucks wen going to do so and it's food already on my bread
6075,9,3,0,7/29/2014,Overrated...food is exceptional...people think they are better than anyone
6076,9,3,0,7/5/2014,I am not a big cheese steak fan. But when anyone comes to visit the want to go to get a philly cheese steak. I have had them they are ok. but you can't go by me I only eat one once a year.
6077,9,3,0,6/8/2014,love their steak with onions
6078,9,3,0,6/4/2014,"Geno's may be one of the most famous cheese steak restaurants in the world but in my personal opinion they are not the best. ˜All Philadelphians have their specific favorite and most don't agree on who makes the best in town. ˜Many Philadelphians think Geno's is the best and it's a great place to go if you are only going to try one cheese steak when you are visiting Philly due to their reputation and wild neon ambiance. ˜ I personally find the best cheese steaks to have the cheese melted on the roll under the meat because it keeps the roll from getting soggy & you can really taste the cheese. ˜That is not how Geno's makes theirs. ˜On the other hand, they are better than most small, single store cheese steak restaurants who make cheese steaks similarly to the way Geno's makes theirs (with the cheese mixed in with the meat). ˜ One of my favorites is actual a single storefront but my other favorite (my #1) has multiple locations and it's most famous location is on South Street with big black and white checker tiles on the outside. ˜ If you are going to South Street you must try this place!!!"
6079,9,3,0,5/30/2014,"If I had a choice between one or the other (the other being Pat's across the street) I would choose Geno's. Really this place is more popular for its history in the city and draws a huge tourist crowd. For the occasional visit when you are in the city is fine, but it gets packed quickly at night (even more so after any Philly home games) but for a really good cheese steak without waiting forever in line head somewhere else."
6080,9,3,0,5/23/2014,"everyone knows that Geno's is better then Pat's stakes , because at Geno's ˜they use more meat on their stakes for your money. plus Geno's ˜workers tell it like is, SPEAK ENGLISH WHEN ORDERING , OR DON'T ORDER .that's why I come here."
6081,9,3,0,5/2/2014,"finally tried their cheese steak after living in philly for almost 15 years. ˜It is very expensive (almost $10) and doesn't give you the option with/ without onion. ˜Compare with the cheese steak that I had in other places, I think Geno was just so so, doesn't worth $10 and you probably can get 2 whole cheese steak else where with that price"
6082,9,3,0,4/29/2014,I love their cheese fries but I don't like the steaks. Too fatty in my opinion
6083,9,3,0,4/24/2014,"its not the best cheese steaks in town, whether the tourists of the world believe it or not...but it is a good a** cheese steak. and being open all kinds of hours of the night is pretty convenient for patrons under the influence of alcohol and in need of a full belly and some time to kill. ˜i do prefer geno's to pats, but be prepared to know exactly what you want and how you want it. good stuff, but not the best."
6084,9,3,0,4/18/2014,"While a visit to the cheesesteak place or places is a must for the tourist, as a local - there are plenty of other places that have much much better cheesesteaks. But Geno's is about more than the food, it is an experience that is part of Philly and a good stop for any tourist."
6085,9,3,0,4/11/2014,Good spot for tourists. Better than Pat's.
6086,9,3,0,3/26/2014,Decent but not the sae quality as pats
6087,9,3,0,3/26/2014,just a short walk down the street lye's Geno's and for a Philly Steak Sub you can go wrong here...
6088,9,3,0,3/23/2014,its a good steak but way over priced
6089,9,3,0,3/11/2014,I have had a few in my day. ˜Not bad but over rated in my opinion.
6090,9,3,0,2/28/2014,"Better than Pat's, but Steve's Prince of Steaks is by far the best steak in Philly - now open in center city."
6091,9,3,0,2/25/2014,"We started seeing the iconic steak joint in Geico commercials and decided to give them another visit for nostalgia sake. So many great options for steaks around the globe these days and better choices in Philly, but still nice for photo op and Whiz!"
6092,9,3,0,1/25/2014,i was only there one time
6093,9,3,0,1/18/2014,Ventured to the OTHER SIDE of the road to see what GENOS had to offer. Good Cheesesteak! Their service was super fast and fun to watch them making all these sandwiches during lunch time. Good fries too. Enjoyed the greasey drippins and overall had a great meal.
6094,9,3,0,12/11/2013,there are better steak places but id go here befor pats!! lived 3 blocks away my whole life soo i know haha but they wont stop people from going because pats and genos has a great atmosphere and its a great experence ˜going there but the steaks are blahh
6095,9,3,0,11/19/2013,"Decent late night steaks, They use cheese wiz; not real cheese. ˜I don't think they are really worth it!"
6096,9,3,0,11/18/2013,Good steaks. ˜They use cheese wiz; not real cheese. ˜Place is a Philly staple so you have to go for the experience. ˜If you have this steak for lunch you will not need to eat dinner. ˜I actually get better Philly cheese steaks in South Jersey.
6097,9,3,0,11/14/2013,"Decent late night steaks, but there are better places to go within city limits, as well as out in the Burbs."
6098,9,3,0,10/5/2013,Overhyped because all other cities cheesesteaks suck. Not a bad cheesesteak but certainly not a $9.50 cheesesteak. Worth a try and that's about it.
6099,9,3,0,9/26/2013,"The place is good, but there are better out there. ˜I would recommend tony lukes for those who havent tried it. ˜But genos is still definitely good! ˜It is a fun place to stop and get a bite with friends. ˜I prefer to have my steak chopped up though!"
6100,9,3,0,9/22/2013,great cheese steaks
6101,9,3,0,9/14/2013,"Long trip from Brooklyn NY, to find out this place was more of a big media trap than a great tasty steak sandwich. The meat was dry I had to add ketchup to it. Usually a Philly cheese steak is juicy with peppers onions and cheese! This place is missing the basics. I can make a better one on my own! The cheese fries were good. I wish i read the reviews before I drove there. The best part of this place is that the service is fast, fast enough to taste my sad sandwich."
6102,9,3,0,9/11/2013,"Good experience, atmosphere and food. ˜If you are visiting Philly, you owe it to yourself to check out the place. ˜The best time to go in late at night."
6103,9,3,0,8/24/2013,Its AIGHT; but aint about em
6104,9,3,0,8/17/2013,"Philly icon lives up to it's rep for good steaks, but not the best I ever had."
6105,9,3,0,8/11/2013,"this is in a ROUGH area with no parking. ˜The cars we did see parked on the street were in tight spots (common in a large city). ˜What is crazy is that the gangs appear to take any vehicle that sits for two minutes as a canvas so some were incredibly tagged. ˜We went here based on recommendations and the rivalry with Pat Kings. ˜Overall, the sandwiches were good but we preferred the rival's. ˜Both are worth trying and seeing what you like."
6106,9,3,0,8/9/2013,this is a staple of the city. make sure you know what you're ordering or you will be shamed =)
6107,9,3,0,8/1/2013,I think Mama's on Belmont Ave. in Bala Cynwyd ˜is better and so is Tony Luke's on Oregon Ave. Tommy DiNics at the Reading Terminal and Nicks Roast Beef are all better values and you get bigger portions.
6108,9,3,0,8/1/2013,the food is mediocre and the price is high. I would go to somewhere else to get a better deal for my bucks
6109,9,3,0,7/24/2013,"It's a tourist spot, the prices keep going up and the quality of the steaks seems to be decreasing. ˜There are better steak spots in the city, but there's no denying the allure of the 9th & Passyunk cheesesteak scene to the uninitiated."
6110,9,3,0,7/16/2013,Definitely not the best in Philadelphia but not so bad
6111,9,3,0,6/27/2013,Geno's is good but I always been a fan of Pat's :/
6112,9,3,0,6/21/2013,"Pretty good food most of the time. But when it's bad, it's bad. Very conveniently close to my house which is a plus."
6113,9,3,0,6/11/2013,The bread is large but the meat is small.
6114,9,3,0,4/30/2013,"Pat's? Geno's? I have to be honest, there is a food truck near the Liberty bell that does it better than both of these, but it doesn't have the novelty of Cheese Steak Vegas."
6115,9,3,0,4/25/2013,They are ok. ˜Kind of a tourist trap.
6116,9,3,0,3/9/2013,"3 stars for the cheesesteaks 4 stars for the bright lights for picture taking at night. Much more picturistic compared to the other places if you like taking pics of tourist spots. Geno's has the least Cheesesteak selections compared to the other places. It's either a steak with your choice of cheese with or without onions or a Pork sandwich I think but not too sure since I only order the Cheesesteak. Like Pat's- parking can be tough, outdoor eating area, no restroom if you eat there and 2 windows to order- 1 for the steaks and the other for fries and drinks. I ordered a Cheesesteak with wiz and onions. The bread is better than Pat's. The Wiz was very watery. But it was an okay Cheesesteak nonetheless. I'm not going to comment about the attitude about staff being abrupt or rude because the staff at Pat's and Jim's act the same way too at times. Or the perceived political controversy because we're talking about food here. You have a right to eat here as well as not to eat here. That's your choice. I enjoyed my Cheesesteak at Geno's and will come here again. And I'll do what I always do and walk across the street to the other company and get the mushroom cheesesteak too. But that's what tourist do. We compare the both when down that way."
6117,9,3,0,1/14/2013,"We stopped by on our way home from NY and we tried both places. First was Geno's it was ok pretty bland no flavor and bread was harder to chew, the meat was sliced not hacked it was alright. ˜I guess we expected more. Sorry we preferred Pat's steak better."
6118,9,3,0,1/1/2013,Pretty good steaks...Their closest competitor still has the best around though..
6119,9,3,0,12/14/2012,"I think the best cheessteak I've ever had was at Barclay Prime. But for the money, this place is alright. It's more of a tourist attraction. Family from our of town ask me to go down there. I prefer my neighborhood pizza shop, honestly."
6120,9,3,0,8/27/2012,"After seeing several shows about the rivalry between Pat's Cheese Steak's and Geno's, we decided to go to Philadelphia and try them both (along with two others). The result was the conclusion that Geno's was much better. Geno's cheese steak (order it with wiz and onions, the best and most popular style) had a lot more wiz on it. The bread was better, and the steak was ok. Do Not, however, come here if you're sensitive to any prejudice. I read one review on here that talked about xenophobic propaganda, and I thought the reviewer was just exaggerating. They weren't. The windows you order from were filled with bumper stickers that stated ""press 1 for English, 2 for deportation,"" ""thank your teachers only if they taught you English,"" and several signs showing Muslim men who had killed a police officer. The food was great and if you have to choose between the two, choose this place. It turns out that ignorance is bliss and so are their cheese steaks."
6121,9,3,0,10/10/2011,"Planned a trip with my family in July because I wanted to taste an authentic Philly cheesesteak. ˜8 of us split up between Geno's & Pat's. ˜I was at Geno's and the guy accused me of being a ""napkin stealer"" because he saw me get napkins from his place and I was wiping off my brother-in-laws leg who had just come from Pat's. ˜So I said to the guy I with them meaning the rest of our group who was a Geno's and he just gave me a look. ˜Their steaks were alright could have used more meat on them. ˜I've had better in Jersey!!"
6122,9,3,0,9/28/2011,Genos roll is better than Pats but the whole steak is not.
6123,9,3,0,7/13/2011,Tried the Geno's & Pats challenge and I liked Pats better. Geno's was still pretty good however. I cant stand the long line at either places but I was there on a holiday weekend so oops.
6124,9,3,0,6/15/2011,"its good, but there is better"
6125,9,3,0,6/3/2011,"One of the ""staple"" Cheesesteak places. ˜Go for the Cheesesteak, ignore the politics. ˜Have a nice day!"
6126,9,3,0,4/14/2011,"We been there couple times. People expect too much from this place since it supposed represent one of the top Philly cheesesteaks.The food is not as good as all the TV food shows make it out to be. The atomsphere is ok, at least the neon signs and stuffs represent part of the neighborhood vive and its history. The price is ok, slightly overprice for the food + atomsphere you get. The cheesesteaks are just typical - good for very hungry folks. However, if you're looking for a tasty cheesesteaks, then try some places else."
6127,9,3,0,2/26/2011,"From what I've been told by the locals, both Pat's and Geno's get their steak, bread, cheese, onions etc, etc from the same distributors? ˜If this in fact true, the only difference between the two is Pat's chop the steak and Geno's does not. ˜It's really a matter of preference not quality or taste. ˜In my opinion, the best cheesesteaks in the country are at Carl's in NYC! ˜No question about it, the bread makes all the difference in the world."
6128,9,3,0,9/22/2010,"I'm really surprised Geno's got such low reviews. I know I haven't been here in a minute, but from what I remember, the steaks are pretty good here. Then again, any cheesesteak in Philly's gotta be better than anywhere in Jersey/New York."
6129,9,3,0,6/28/2010,Very long line. Maybe open a second window? Don't like the whole racism but the Cheese Steak and Cheese Fries were amazing.
6130,9,3,0,5/22/2010,The best Cheese steak in Philly when your drunk. I love going to Genos after partying at old city. Three stars for food One star for rude employees at Geno's. Geno's employees sucks
6131,9,3,0,1/27/2010,"Geno's steaks is grrrrreat!!!! I went to see my online friend south philly Billy for a weekend in Bryn Mawr for a weekend last week. South Philly Billy lives in the basement in his mom's house in Bryn Mawr. He's got a sweet setup!!! He's lived in Bryn Mawr all his life and only been to south Philly once when all of us online friends dared him to go to south Philly bc ˜he was all messed up on jolt soda and melaluca pills and on a 73 hour world of warcraft binge, so we nicknamed him south Philly Billy!!! ˜He was so hungry and delirious we told him to go and get a real cheese steak from Geno's and he did it!!!! He usually gets his steaks from Sun Valley and that place stinks blue Nav'i poopers!!! He said Geno's steaks was like tasting what Avatar unobtainium ˜would taste like if it were in cheesesteak form!!! I wish they delivered to Bryn Mawr!! Me and south Philly Billy are online world of war craft friends but we also call each other and watch ""American idol"" together and I had missed a bunch of episodes bc of my current active social life and he had them tivo'd so I flew to Bryn Mawr and played world of warcraft and watched American idol together, especially bc our friend Neil was gonna be on!! Neil totally rocked the place!!! And he was totally sweating less than usual!!! But that super nerd Simon wouldn't let Neil pass. phwwwww. I totally think this idol is rigged, Neil was the best!!!!! So we drank away our disappointment....we each drank, like, 4 jolt colas!!! And I was super messed up and I dared him that we should go to Geno's steaks in south Philly...all that cool cola courage made me so impulsive!!! So we did!! South Philly Billy is a total tough guy, so he insisted on driving...well we made it to GENO'S Steaks in South Philly and no one threw 40 oz bottles at South Philly Billy's Mom's minivan!! That was such a plus. The line was super duper long and we got in and South Phil Bill said that I needed to summon all my Seinfeld ""Soup Nazi"" power and to carefully walk in line and order fast; otherwise they might send me to the back of the line!! Gollly! ˜that place smelled so good!! There were a couple of girls in line ahead of us and they had lots of hairspray and makeup and it looked like their hair was riding a wave. South Philly Billy is totally a ladies man, he has gotten the furthest out of all of us online gamers bc he is by far the best looking....he once touched a girl where she peed!!!! Honest Abe!!! So he started talking to these girls with the wave hair but I got nervous bc I didn't want to cheat on Katia so I didn't say anything and just listened.....the girls were natives of the neighborhood and told us we better know how to order!!! I thought : ""Geez Louise Antifreeze how hard is it to order a cheesesteak!??!?!?"" The line slowly moved and South Philly Billy got his steak and all of a sudden it was my turn!!! I was so nervous I was sweating like crazy!!! I slowly walked up and stuttered "" one south Philadelphia cheesesteak please"" Guy: ""What the F#ck do you want?"" Me: ""One South Philly Cheesesteak please"" Guy: ""Wiz wit?"" Me: What game is that???? Guy: ""get ta the back of the line schnook!!! This happened about 6 times and on my 7th time waiting in line I just said ""YES"" when he said ""WizWit"" and I got my cheesesteak!!! It really was like tasting Avatar Nav'i Unobtanium in cheesesteak form!! The meat was dry and salty, and the cheese whiz had melted all the way through the bread and meat...my only complaint was I didn't order any onions! Im allergic to them!! ˜PHwww! I had to pick them out one by one but it was soooo worth it!!!! Next time I visit South Philly Billy in Bryn Mawr we are totally going to Jim's---even if I have to walk out smelling like an onion!!!"
6132,9,3,0,5/3/2009,"I've heard some mixed reviews on Geno's and I figured I would give it a try. I wasn't all that impressed. ˜I waited in line for about 15 minutes. ˜I ordered a cheesesteak with the whiz and onions. ˜I finally received my cheesesteak opened it and took a bite. ˜The cheese whiz and onions were amazing. ˜As for the steak itself, it was very dry and cold. ˜I think I will try Pat's next time."
6133,9,3,0,3/13/2009,"its ok but i think its over rated, pat is better"
6134,9,3,0,2/5/2009,"Geno's is basically in the same boat as pats, only the meat is a little better. The people are even better then those at pats. If you go at four in the morning and the owner is there he is alwyas ready to share a story with you about one of the hundreds of picyures plastered around the building and on the tables. The food is ok, but no where near a great , the steaks are on a scale of 1-10 a 5 and the fries are an 8. I am raised and born on philadelphia and so is geno's they even donated 400 thousand dollars to the mumers parade, which our ""great fucking mayor"" did away with because of his ""budget cuts"" (take a pay cut you dick). Anyone from philly will tell you when you ask for a great staek that you go to any cornerestore or deli."
6135,9,4,0,11/23/2014,"I love the novelty of the place you feel like your somewhere special with the Vegas style lights, and seeing all the famous people that have been there only downfall is the prices just keep going up and up."
6136,9,4,0,10/29/2014,very good
6137,9,4,0,10/25/2014,Now here is a place That I have to vote on as the best in Philly for sure. If you have been here you know they are they bomb don't hate and you cant say there competition is better no sir. I go here all the time and will continue to do so. go genos!
6138,9,4,0,10/21/2014,"Really good food, would go again!"
6139,9,4,0,10/10/2014,Whoever doesn't rank Geno as having at least 4 stars doesn't know their cheese steaks. These things are addictive and for a good reason. World Renound. Number one! The one and only Genos!
6140,9,4,0,10/8/2014,"How anyone can give this place less than 3 stars is just being a nitpicker. Though, I prefer to go to Pat's (since they invented the cheesesteak). The cheesesteak is good, the staff does their best, and it's a Philly icon. The place is clean. Prices are average for Philly."
6141,9,4,0,10/1/2014,"Cheesesteak was pretty good, albeit this is quite a touristy place and I'm sure there are plenty of better places in town, maybe without the hype but good or even better. Went for one here followed by another at Pat's. I preferred Geno's bread, but was more a fan of Pat's steak which was filleted and just less dry, with more onions. And the dried red pepper gave it that oomph!!"
6142,9,4,0,9/26/2014,"Hi, I was visiting Philadelphia for one of my friends marriage. We decided to try different places and Geno's steaks was one of them because it was nearby. It was a wonderful experience. The bread was very soft and fresh. Meat was very juicy while the Cheese was ok. Wasn't so impressed by the customer service though and the seating area. Will definitely come back."
6143,9,4,0,9/16/2014,"Cash only and rude as can be. Cheesesteak was amazing and worth the abuse, but I would expect that the bad service would get old after a while. Not a great part of town. The line was all the way in the street, good thing they only take cash or the line would have been all the way to Center City."
6144,9,4,0,9/11/2014,there good but not as good as jims steaks on south st but genos is definitely the runner up I recommend them
6145,9,4,0,9/4/2014,"I love Geno Steaks. Every time I visit center city I make sure I stop by and get one. Fried onions, wiz and ketchup yummmmmm."
6146,9,4,0,8/27/2014,"Really good Philly steaks, been a customer since 1969, juicy and tasty to the last bite ! The best !!"
6147,9,4,0,8/13/2014,"Ok so the steaks are good yea,little costly but whatever,the thing I don't get is why the hell do they have the hot sauce in a red container like its ketchup!!!! I put it all over my cheesesteak before I knew it wasn't ketchup!!!!! Change the damn hot sauce jar!!!!! It looks like ketchup !!!!!"
6148,9,4,0,8/9/2014,Great Philly Steak.
6149,9,4,0,7/31/2014,"Always great, wish they took credit cards though. Its 2014 wake up"
6150,9,4,0,7/30/2014,i went there one time before had the pork chop sandwich. not bad at all but just needs some more meat
6151,9,4,0,7/7/2014,:)
6152,9,4,0,6/26/2014,I like the Genos over pat's any day of the week.
6153,9,4,0,6/26/2014,"This is where I had my first cheesesteak when I moved to Philadelphia. Other than maybe Pat's across the street, there is no where else to have your first. I personally prefer geno's just because I think its a bit neater and the presentation is nice. If you're disappointed, you clearly don't know great food!"
6154,9,4,0,6/18/2014,"It is an experience thing, and something fun to do. ˜Buy one at each place, ˜cut them in half, ˜or um, tear them in half, and share the halves with a significant other or friend, etc and compare them. By the way, ˜its not racist to ask a person to order in a language that the person taking the order can understand. ˜It is racist however, to insist someone learn the language you want to order in because you refuse to assimilate and learn the language of your adopted country. Ive been to other countries, ˜and I assure you, ˜they expect you to learn their language if you want to live there."
6155,9,4,0,6/3/2014,"good cheese steaks, great location lots of lights."
6156,9,4,0,5/28/2014,"They are like an exact replica of Pat's steaks, plus MAD lighting. Ridiculous amount of lighting and decoration to try and show up the originators across the street, but I just cannot betray Pat's. I will admit, I have taken the challenge. I have bit into a steak from each place, pat's and geno's, and I can't tell any difference that would force me to choose one over the over, based off of taste alone. Since I love Pat's cheesesteaks, and Geno's is almost an exact replica, I have to give them a high score. I stick with Pat's being the best only because they started the whole thing and allowed everyone else to hop on the bandwagon, but HEY, these competitors did a great job imitating."
6157,9,4,0,5/28/2014,"I do not go into the city too often but Geno's is a nice treat when I do! ˜The steak is delicious, the American Cheese sauce is to die for, the cheese fries are amazing. ˜Just make sure you know what you want prior to ordering! ˜The lines get long but it moves quickly - don't be the one that holds it up!"
6158,9,4,0,5/13/2014,Yummy food and cool environment... where can you go wrong...? I think I could have stopped after the salad but the smell from the kitchen was too much to handle...
6159,9,4,0,4/27/2014,"A little flashy, but I love the patriotic atmosphere. It is a staple of Philadelphia, and I personally ˜think its cheese steaks are way better than Pat's. There is always a huge line but it moves pretty fast. It is also a great place to satisfy your hunger after a long night of partying. I would recommend the wiz wit"
6160,9,4,0,4/19/2014,"Solid, better know how to order."
6161,9,4,0,4/9/2014,I'll give you a 4 because Pat's is 5. But you're still good Geno's
6162,9,4,0,3/16/2014,I love their food. ˜I will be back there again.
6163,9,4,0,3/10/2014,The perfect Philly experience: A Pats Steak paired with Geno's cheese fries
6164,9,4,0,3/10/2014,"One of the top Philadelphia Steakery's, can't beat a juicy, greasy Cheesesteak after a great night out or for you Eagles fans, to enjoy after a loss!"
6165,9,4,0,3/1/2014,"A cheesesteak can only be so good. And it doesn't quite get better than Geno's. Their steak is sliced, not shredded like Pat's across the street, and many other locations would. Everyone compares this to Pat's, so here's my answer; I ordered ""American without"" at both locations; you get your steak with american cheese on a bun, nothing else included. Not sure who honestly likes cheeze whiz, so I can't comment on the quality of those, but whether it be the steak itself or the cheese, this sandwich is the best I've had. Anyone can cook the shredded steak like Pat's. Honestly, go to your local pizza shop and order a cheesesteak. You won't really tell the difference between that and Pat's. Find a place that makes sliced steak sandwiches like Geno's, with American cheese that tastes this good, and you let me know. A word of advice; this places serves probably thousands of customers every week. They do not need your business. They need to get you out of the way so the 50 people in line behind you don't leave. Figure out what you're ordering before you get to the door and have your cash ready. Speak clearly and you'll get what you want. And of course, since their menu is written in English and all of the staff only speaks English, order in English. That's not racism, it's common sense."
6166,9,4,0,2/27/2014,Genos Steaks are amazing. Love visiting whenever I can with my family when I'm in Philadelphia. A bit fast paced but thats what you get for such a popular food spot!
6167,9,4,0,2/22/2014,Great Steak one of the best
6168,9,4,0,2/17/2014,In the South Philly cheesesteak wars my money is with Geno's. Go for the provolone.
6169,9,4,0,2/16/2014,Great steak with cheese whiz! My favorite although I'm also a fan of Pat's and Jim's. But I had a great one today at Geno's :)
6170,9,4,0,2/7/2014,I give this place the slight edge over Pat's but both are good in my book. Have to get the steak with wiz and onions. Order a steak and enjoy the smells while you eat and then lock the doors and get the hell out of there!
6171,9,4,0,1/25/2014,"Geno's definitely has the best steaks ˜in Philly. I admit that the prices are high, the xenophobia is off-putting and the location is tough to park at but the steaks are perfect! I always take cheesesteak newbies here so they can compare to other steaks they have around the city. It's a fun, touristy kinda place. The staff is all Philly....kinda rude but they love their steaks, As far as a day to day place to get a steak I would def not go through all the havoc of coming to Genos but its a nice treat once in a while. Just dont go on the weekends when the tourists are waiting in an hour long line. I prefer to go later at night after the bar, nothing is better than a cheesesteak at 3am."
6172,9,4,0,1/16/2014,an ok steak
6173,9,4,0,1/12/2014,"This place has been on my list from when I first moved into the city over 3 years ago because of the outstanding reviews and top reviews this place makes. ˜The food was good, nothing outstanding, but I guess I just had higher expectations. Consequently, I would have even rated this lower, but Jose, our server, was the saving grace of this place. ˜He had a tremendous knowledge of the menu and had some excellent suggestions when it came to the food (my favorites of the night: PHILADELPHIA CHEESE-STEAK). ˜ Why 4 stars? ˜Because of a mix-up with the kitchen, my plus 1 and I had to wait close to an hour for extra napkins Jose came to the rescue again and gave us a complimentary cheese plate for the mix-up after we finished before dessert. ˜Not so bad? ˜WELL...my date found a small hair in her cheesesteak, and because we waited so long, we weren't going to be THAT guy to send it back so we cut around it and left that in the plate. ˜Looking in hindsight, I should've sent it back because of the money I spent here so I think it is very kind for me be giving 3 stars. I understand this may be a one-off-scenario with a place like this, but I am really not sure I will be coming back anytime soon. ˜SO, to sum up, Food - 2; Service - 5 (THANKS JOSE) Again, take this review as a one off, but I expect places like this to be top notch for everyone, and I guess I was that unfortunate odd-ball-out."
6174,9,4,0,12/10/2013,Love it!
6175,9,4,0,12/4/2013,"i think geno's has better cheese steaks but pat's has better cheese fries. my opinion but i always choose geno's with extra hot bell peppers. yum! oh yeah, better know what you want in advance and just say what type of chesse and with or without (fried onions). i.e. wiz with or provolone without. otherwise, you'll get some eyes rolled. that's philly for ya."
6176,9,4,0,12/3/2013,Love Genos! ˜Best cheesesteaks I've ever had!
6177,9,4,0,10/30/2013,"Heard it was the best, and it was really good. Great, fast service to boot."
6178,9,4,0,10/20/2013,yummy steaks
6179,9,4,0,10/16/2013,"I have been here and I love the steaks! ˜The meat and cheese melts in your mouth leaving you wanting more! ˜One negative, it is a bit crowded there and a bit dirty on the ground, and not enough employees are employed to take care of guests concerns. ˜However, if you're looking for a good old fashioned steak, ""Geno's"" has one of the best!"
6180,9,4,0,10/4/2013,Love the steaks :-)
6181,9,4,0,9/28/2013,"When in Philly try a ""real"" cheese steak right? I looked up the most popular ones, and read about Genos VS. Pats, right across the street from each other. So we figured we'd try one from each. We tried Genos first, and then went over to Pats. You definitely need to know exactly what you want when you get up to the window. These guys don't play around. No one was rude, they are just very to the point, and all about getting the food out quick. The cheese wiz was really good though on these Philly steaks, I had never tried that before. The meat at Genos was more like thick slices, and I prefer the more ""chopped up"" meat at Pats. Genos bread was much softer though and thats my preference. They did have a sign at the ordering window about speaking english if you expect service. Apparently kind of controversial. I thought it was hilarious, myself. ˜So between Pats and Genos, I'd say I preferred Pats overall. Just be sure to order correctly- I was listening to other people order before and after us, and you can tell the locals from the tourists for sure. The locals simply for a ""wiz wit onions"". ˜Really funny. The steak was good though, I would certainly eat there again."
6182,9,4,0,9/25/2013,"pretty good, but i still prefer patt's"
6183,9,4,0,9/19/2013,"Great philly landmark and I am firmly in the Geno's camp, just tastes better to me than Pat's. Always hit up Geno's before any sporting event that I attend."
6184,9,4,0,9/17/2013,This is a Philadelphia icon. ˜The meat is juicy and blends really well with the cheese. ˜The fries are also really tasty.
6185,9,4,0,9/16/2013,"I have loved Geno's for years. Hadn't been there for a while. Just went back and it was delicious. ˜Great cheesesteak and fries. Service was ok, but the food brings it to a 4."
6186,9,4,0,9/10/2013,"I went back to genos last week for the first time in years loaded steak lots of meat, the roll could've been better ,the place is still the cleanest in town, a good place to take out of towners for their first steak!"
6187,9,4,0,9/8/2013,love that its open all the time
6188,9,4,0,8/30/2013,"Real tasty..not a huge sandwich but meat was tasty and the bread was excellent. I was impressed especially after reading some of the negative reviews. Went there on a Sunday afternoon waited maybe 10-15 minutes in line. Staff that I dealt with, the cashier, was okay but I wasn't looking for pleasantries. Just wanted a cheesesteak. Good experience."
6189,9,4,0,8/21/2013,I had my first Geno's steak not long ago and it was very good! ˜I don't venture into this part of Philly very often. ˜I've been to this area only twice before and both times got a Pat's steak. ˜ Went for Geno's this time and was not disappointed!
6190,9,4,0,8/20/2013,Very good steaks..
6191,9,4,0,8/11/2013,"My family and I visited in-laws about a year ago and I wanted my kids to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak. It was tough to find parking and the area wasn't so great. On the bright side, we all loved the cheesesteaks although it wasn't really what we were expecting. All of my friends were telling me how amazing the cheesesteaks in Philly were so I was expecting an experience that was completely out of the ordinary. The sandwich honestly tasted about the same as some of the places that I go to into in the OC when I am at home. Still a good sandwich though..."
6192,9,4,0,8/5/2013,yummy
6193,9,4,0,7/23/2013,No matter which of the Philly favorites you favor it should not mean that you don;t enjoy the others product just as well. I prefer Jim's but that does not mean I have not spent many night at Geno's. Not only great taste but also an experience.
6194,9,4,0,7/23/2013,I love their fries!!!!
6195,9,4,0,7/2/2013,I've been going to Geno's for almost 30 years! ˜I;ve always loved the food and the staff is a bunch of real people - thats a compliment. I miss seeing Joey powerwashing the sidewalk after I would pull up at 5 in the morning on my way home from after-hours! ˜but the place is still great and as clean as ever!
6196,9,4,0,6/28/2013,Not the best cheese steak but its pretty good
6197,9,4,0,6/27/2013,"One of the best places to get a famous Philly cheese steak from. Delicious food, ˜fast service, ˜food so good you get hooked."
6198,9,4,0,6/26/2013,The cheese steak here is better than the one across the street. I am sure for this but the price is kind of expensive for half hoagie steak.
6199,9,4,0,6/26/2013,"Being from Philly, it would be a true tragedy for me not to visit and indulge in Geno's. Needless to say, I have been a true fan all my life. Though I am not one for the lines, I don't mind considering they are open so late or shall I say early in the am. I love the fact that there is outdoor sitting, I can watch my food being made the service is great......Always a repeat offender of Geno's."
6200,9,4,0,6/24/2013,"I don't care what anyone says, the steaks here are fabulous. The staff isn't the friendliest but its Philadelphia for gods sakes! A true landmark."
6201,9,4,0,6/21/2013,Pretty good they screwed up once though and put onions on my steak.
6202,9,4,0,6/20/2013,GINO'S & JIMS'S best cheese steaks in Philly
6203,9,4,0,6/9/2013,good food
6204,9,4,0,6/8/2013,Been to geno's steaks! They are pretty good. But I like prince of steaks better.
6205,9,4,0,6/6/2013,Geno's Steaks is great! Absolutely love it!
6206,9,4,0,6/5/2013,"Geno's or Pat's - you seriously have to try both! They are both Philly landmarks! I agree that you can make one just as good at home, but it's the experience you are paying for. It's like going to Pinks if you are in LA! A must do!"
6207,9,4,0,5/31/2013,"If you want a REAL cheesteak hoagie, this is the place to go. ˜I used to live only a couple blocks away and I really do miss the succulent chopped meat, melted cheese and fried onions sizzled on the grill to perfection a few times a week. ˜Now I have to take Septa to get there but I know if I want it done right it's time to hop on that bus."
6208,9,4,0,5/26/2013,As an outsider I must say that both Geno's and its friend across the street are top notch for the traditional steak sandwich (each with their own twist). ˜I prefer not to choose sides and simply recommend to try them (both).
6209,9,4,0,5/25/2013,Geno's I believe is way better than Pat's. I believe there steaks should be chopped like a proper Philadelphia cheesesteak. The rolls a great. The lines are really not worth the wait for either place.
6210,9,4,0,5/9/2013,"Great Steak's, real americans! I know everyone has their favorite CS but Geno's still does it right. Look forward to my next trip here for a cheesesteak at 9:30 in the morning"
6211,9,4,0,5/7/2013,I prefer Pat's but no doubt I'll come here and switch it up every once in a while
6212,9,4,0,5/3/2013,My favorite cheese fries ever! I
6213,9,4,0,5/1/2013,good steaks!!!! ˜better than pats
6214,9,4,0,5/1/2013,"while joey vento has passed away the family has continued his ideals, the meat, cheese and rolls are always fresh, they move very quickly to fill your order the only thing i am not so happy with are the fries, they just taste odd otherwise the sandwiches are very good"
6215,9,4,0,2/5/2013,Geno's wasn't to bad for a cheese steak. ˜I had a mushroom cheese steak and it was Great!
6216,9,4,0,2/5/2013,"Excellent cheesesteaks. ˜Bread is crispy outside and soft inside. ˜Meat is savoury. ˜The sandwiches are a bit saltier than most, and I like them that way. ˜Park nearby so that you can be sheltered from the heat or cold while you devour."
6217,9,4,0,9/9/2012,"Geno's is a Philly icon, and for good reason. ˜The 'wiz wit' seemed like a bad idea at first, but upon my first taste, I realized how mistaken I was. ˜Provolone? Was I seriously getting provolone for that long? ˜God almighty, I was missing out! ˜I've seen a lot of bad reviews on this place, and I've decided that its a sign of the end of Western Civilization."
6218,9,4,0,9/2/2012,"Visiting Philly for the first time I and a colleague had to stop by an authentic cheesesteak place. ˜Got a tip from a life long Philadelpian to try Geno's and/or Pats, so off we ventured forth. ˜Got to say coming down 9th Ave. to get to both these places was a trip and a half since we don't have brownstones in Seattle. ˜We decided to stop at Geno's and get our fill there. ˜Ordered a cheese steak """"with"" and was not disappointed. ˜OMG......greasy steak with cheese whiz and onions - holy crap Batman is was soooo freaking good. ˜Got some cheese fries with it as well and they were OK (that's what gives this place four and not five stars). ˜I'll be back in a couple of weeks to try Pats, but got to say as a a native West Coast'r Geno's was pretty damn good."
6219,9,4,0,8/21/2011,My favorite place for Steaks been going there for years and will continue to do so and the fact that he has English only signs ˜up makes me love the place even more so...I'm lmao at all the Gino's is racist comments..yup how dare he demand that English only be used at his establishment? hilarious..this is America! We speak English! Political Correctness is the ruining of our country. ˜If you want a good steak this is the place to go.
6220,9,4,0,6/22/2011,"Really juicy, well-seasoned steak! Their cheesesteaks are the best!"
6221,9,4,0,6/14/2011,"My husband and I visitied Philly for the weekend and wanted to try an authentic cheesesteak. ˜We bought one at Geno's and one directly across the street at Pat's. They were the same price but the Pat's sandwich had more meat, more cheese, more onions, and a larger roll. My husband preferred Pat's however, he agreed with me that the meat at Geno's was better. My aversion to cheesesteaks has always been that the meat is overcooked and tastes like shoe leather. However, the meat at Geno's was tender and delicious and for that reason I preferred it over Pat's. If you are visiting the area I recommend that you do the same thing we did and just try one of each to compare."
6222,9,4,0,3/31/2011,Anyone can make a cheese steak but I love the rolls at Genos.
6223,9,4,0,3/7/2011,good steaks. quick. but pats is better.
6224,9,4,0,10/12/2010,"Geno's steaks is a staple in Philly cuisine, and for a good reason. ˜As evident by the wall of photographs, celebrities and common folk alike flock to this mecca of Philly cheesesteaks. ˜Admittedly, I ordered a steak sandwich and some fries, which only took a couple of minutes to wait (but they do not come together and require waiting in two different lines). ˜The price is ok for a quick bite, but nothing spectacular. ˜The sandwich is tasty, albeit a little greasy. ˜I decided to add some hot sauce, which I immediately regretted. ˜There is no warning posted about how spicy that sauce is. ˜Use with caution and have a lot of water nearby."
6225,9,4,0,9/17/2010,"I'm originally from Phili and my kids and i used to go here all the time! Before i moved to the Washington DC area, we lived close by to Geno's. I know that theres this rivalry between Geno's and Pat's King, and don't get me wrong i do go to both, but i really love Geno's cheese steak. Its original and my all times favorite."
6226,9,4,0,1/18/2010,"Fast service, clean, lively environment and an excellent steak! I'd like to know where all these other ""better"" steak joints are, because, seriously, Geno's is one of the top four or five in the city. Way better than Tony Puke's, by the way. I still don't understand how people call the employees ""rude."" I order my steak, they give me my steak. I order my fries and soda, they give me my fries and soda. Never once had a problem or felt like I annoyed them. It must be the younger generation who grew up with their parents and the media telling them they're ""special."" Get over yourselves and just order your goddam steak and get the hell out of the way. I don't think the people on here giving the poor reviews are genuine, btw, I think they just hate Joey Vento's politics. Why would they patronize a joint already knowing the owner has views that they hate? They wouldn't. A lot of fraudulent one-star reviews here."
6227,9,4,0,8/9/2008,"Geno's is awesome, enough said!"
6228,9,5,0,1/1/2015,Tastes good
6229,9,5,0,12/27/2014,"While Amin A couldn't be more wrong, Geno's does not cut their steak up while Pats does. To all the bad reviews on here I say this..... Why is there a line here 24-7? They clearly do something right. BYW you're not food critics... Don't forget that."
6230,9,5,0,10/13/2014,Great place to eat and have always enjoyed their service and their food.
6231,9,5,0,10/8/2014,"Just got back to AZ from a 10 day trip to Brazil and Argentina with Gate1 Travel. They do a superior job with their escorted tours. Not only great value for the dollar spent, but a chance to experience travel in a meaningful and thoughtful manner. For those seeking a break from the beaten paths of Europe, Gate1 offers a number of Latin American tours that blend the best of urban culture with history, archeology, and exquisite natural phenomena like Iguazu Falls which we visited on this trip. The feeling one gets when peering into the abyss that is our Grand Canyon is matched by the senses that are stirred by the power and energy of these enormous thundering waters on the border of Brazil and Argentina. Gate1 always offers comfortable hotels, experienced and personable tour directors and plenty of time for independent exploration. I have also visited Peru, Ecuador and Costa Rica as well as Egypt, Morocco,Turkey and the Baltics with Gate1 and suggest that any serious devotee of travel check this company out. You will not be disappointed."
6232,9,5,0,9/20/2014,"Eh..err...arrg. I'm a bit of a food snob these days..as in..I don't have kids and I plan on using my extra money that I'm not putting towards retirement towards good food. For cheesesteaks this means Barclay Prime's $150 cheesesteak. Life is good. That said, I suppose one can not live off foie gras, high end salmon, truffles and caviar alone. When I was coming up, I was a Geno's guy. I still consider myself a Geno's guy in that..I'm going to pick Geno's over Pat's if I'm going to Geno's..because, nostalgia perhaps. I think the steaks here are a bit better than Pat's, perhaps its the rolls that are of better quality. Still, these days I find cheesesteaks lacking proper texture qualities unless prepared by a private cook or just at home with some high end local grass fed meats. It seems Geno's has given into some slight laziness by leaving the meat on the grill too long..perhaps by stacking it and reheating it. Not sure. It just seems dryer than I remember when I was younger. I still love the cheesesteak, wit and wiz. The English only sign I see as more of a character setting than anything else, it doesn't bother me nor delight me. It just seems like it was placed there for the attention and with the intent to get that Americana feel to it at the peak of the Freedom Fries phenomena. Despite the flaws, I love this place. I love that they are 24/7. My favorite time to eat here is at 3-4am on a cold rainy fall night. Something about that brings back all these nostalgic feelings that bring me an era of being a 16 year old just with his license who told his mother he was going to school early to uhh..study for the SAT while instead my friends and I would drive here from the suburbs for an early morning breakfast..or sometimes..after a concert or party a late evening snack..occurring at the same time of the day...4am. Be it stoned off my face and eating 5 of these sandwiches or dangerously drunk underage..and..well..eating 5 of these sandwiches..this was a staple for my teen years set up by years of my dad and older brothers taking us here after ball games. Going here in the cold rainy late fall nights around 4am is just ...like Christmas for me oddly. I just wish the fires that used to burn in the trash cans across the street, neighboring area back in the early-mid 1990s were still around..that smell of wood burning..rain, fall..cheesesteaks. Err...outbeats the $150 cheesesteak from Barclays any day..however..I'm more likely to be willing to spoil myself on Barclays once a month and leave Geno's for a few visits in the fall, winter, and early spring. Only recommendations, figure out what's making the meat seem dry and cut it off.

6242,9,5,0,7/19/2014,"The best cheesesteak joint in the city. ˜When I get a cheesesteak, I always go to Geno's. ˜The coolest staff, the cleanest place, and I love the Cherry Soda(NOT CHERRY COKE)..."

6261,9,5,0,3/17/2014,Thier Great!!
6262,9,5,0,3/13/2014,Best steak in the tristate area!
6263,9,5,0,3/13/2014,"First of all, let's be clear that if you're going to Geno's, you should NOT be expecting a 5-star fine dining experience served up on a golden platter with a glass of champagne...it's a cheesesteak shop of God's sake!! It's where you go to enjoy a fast, greasy, calorie-filled sandwich! The guy at the window seems to speak his own language when he's yelling the orders back to the sandwich makers, and that's all part of the experience. I ordered a Geno's sandwich and my boyfriend ordered a Pat's sandwich, both the traditional way (Whiz-Wit - that means cheese-whiz and grilled onions on top) and we tasted them side by side. Without a doubt, Geno's is the winner. Their bread is so much better, and they didn't overdo the cheese whiz, plus they wrapped it up nicely so the sandwich didn't spill all over the place as we walked to our seats (can't say the same about Pat's). The Geno's sandwich was not only more delicious, it was bigger too! Win-Win! Sure, there's usually a really long line, and afterwards you might ask yourself, ""Why did I eat that? That was so unhealthy!"" but then you'll come to your senses and say, ""I'm so glad I had that delicious taste of cheesesteak heaven and I don't care if I just gained 10 pounds!"" If you're looking for the authentic Philly cheesesteak experience, with all the grease and calories included, Geno's is where to find it."
6264,9,5,0,3/11/2014,Definition of classic Philadelphia. Old school and exactly what you would expect. Its the real deal and its a landmark. I take all my west coast guests here its a must.
6265,9,5,0,3/4/2014,"I agree with the statement of ˜""Elizabeth W."""
6266,9,5,0,3/1/2014,"Most locals call Genos and Pats ""tourist traps"" but quite frankly folks, its all part of the experience. If you want some fine dining, hipster experience then go uptown. If you want the turn of the century, greasy South Philly experience, then that's what you get at Genos. Know what to expect, you are eating a piece of history, that's why the price is the way it is (not to mention the rising cost of running a business)."
6267,9,5,0,2/21/2014,The food at Geno's Steaks are great!! The steak rolls are filled to the top withthe toppings you want and the food is hot!!!!

6274,9,5,0,11/22/2013,Best Philadelphia cheese steak hands down! ˜The others are good but in my opinion genos is at the top of the top. ˜Not only do they have the best cheese steaks but there cherry peppers in the condiment section are the best i have ever tasted! i wish i lived closer i would eat there everyday!

6278,9,5,0,10/6/2013,one of the many tastes of Philadelphia With so many cheese steak shops what would it be without Geno's? I'll always eat here when given the opportunity Ive eaten while contracting home remodeling at hundreds of sandwich shops Geno's makes the top 10 for sure! Enjoy!!
6279,9,5,0,10/4/2013,I have to say this is the best place in Philadelphia to stop and grab a bite to eat if you are craving a cheese steak. The way they cook their food is indescribable. Make sure you get it made with cheese wiz and you will not regret trying out this place. And they also send off such a good vibe because everyone loves it there due to the amazing food. #Loveit

6287,9,5,0,8/10/2013,"Great steaks, Love this place!!!!!"
6288,9,5,0,8/5/2013,A lot of tourists do not understand Geno's system... get em in ... get em out..... learn how to order your steak sub before you come to philly and complain they go to fast. The owner is a solid guy! He has given me generous service.... and even popped in to my job and left an awesome tip!
6289,9,5,0,8/1/2013,Gotta love Geno's better than Pats steaks!
6290,9,5,0,7/26/2013,Pretty good cheesesteaks in Philly

6293,9,5,0,6/23/2013,I cannot believe someone complained about a Cheese steak at Genos. It is not flavorless lol... It taste amazing! Beef steaks with melted cheese running through your tongue is delicious! Its worth $9 and it is not your ordinary sandwitch! It is nothing like subway or anything else! It is def worth the experience.
6294,9,5,0,6/22/2013,Better than Pat's
6295,9,5,0,6/18/2013,"Delicious! A long time Philly favorite. Not a fan of cheese wiz though,"
6296,9,5,0,6/18/2013,Best Cheese Steaks ever!!!

6299,9,5,0,6/8/2013,"Philly Cheesesteaks are one of the best sandwiches you can eat. Geno's understands that and represents Philly proudly. As far as who makes the best cheesesteak in Philly? I am still in the process of researching them all, but Geno's is one of the best for certain."
6300,9,5,0,6/3/2013,the best chesse steaks ever I LOVE GENO'S the meat the roll the chesse everything about them the fries is great to not to greasy you can even sit right there and eat your food while its still hot so run down to south philly and order your meal you'll love it .

6302,9,5,0,5/12/2013,I have family from out of town that when they come to visit I always bring them to Geno's it is just the perfect Philly cheese steak every made so perfectly
6303,9,5,0,4/30/2013,Been there 8 that !!!!
6304,9,5,0,4/3/2013,evry friday
6305,9,5,0,3/10/2013,If you're looking for cheesesteak in Philadelphia. This place is okay but nothing special. You really got ask for extra cheese.
6306,9,5,0,1/31/2013,"Geno's is as good as any cheesesteak place in Philly. We have been to Pat's, Tony Luke's, Dinic's and even though their most popular way to serve them is with Cheez Wiz, you can order them with provolone, which is still the best cheese for a cheesesteak. I think Geno's ratings have been hurt by all the PC people because, when he was alive, he would make people order in English."
6307,9,5,0,1/29/2013,Best Cheese Steaks in Philadelphia Fuck PAT'S
6308,9,5,0,1/19/2013,"I'll start out like this. I've had cheese steaks at Geno's,Tony Luke's,and Pat's.They all are equally good in my opinion. I choose to support Geno's because of Joey Vento's public, pro American views.When in South Philly,I will support Geno's,only,because of this.I am proud to be an American as well!"
6309,9,5,0,1/2/2013,nothing better than a late night Genos run

6313,9,5,0,11/27/2011,"From Jersey we needed a cheesesteak as we were visiting Philly and we were recommended to go to Geno's. When we parked we considered going to Pat's but it looked much more sketchy and unclassy as Geno's which was bustling with people and electric neon lights, etc. Seeing reviews saying Pat's is better actually surprises me - don't assume so fast at the looks to the restaurant. Well, this is a review for Geno's so i'll continue. It was delicious, a nice atmosphere, and a truly cool place because of all the fame behind it, etc. Great, authentic Philly Cheesesteak."
6314,9,5,0,8/30/2011,My 1st official PCS. it was truly awesome! I came here at 1am after partying in downtown..(byblos). its the best! now that im in california..im craving it each time i see a philly steak place. You guys have won me over..all the way from Cali..also they have this nice memorial in front of it..very touching..and they have almost every hollywood actor's picture on their wall of fame. This wins over pats because they have thin filets of steak. however i ate at both! rivalry at its fullest!
6315,9,5,0,8/25/2011,The best steaks! ˜The best family!
6316,9,5,0,8/20/2011,"Our family of five (three kids ages 17, 14 and 11) visited Philly this summer for the historic sites and also went out for some Philly Cheesesteaks. ˜We went to both Jim's and Geno's. ˜Jim's was good, but Geno's was much much better. ˜Geno's service was fast and courteous. ˜Geno's bread was nice and fresh, steak had awesome flavor which was complemented by the onions and cheese. ˜Our family loved looking at all the photos and memories on the walls while we fully enjoyed our Steak Sandwich. ˜Everyone fully enjoyed the Geno's experience!"
6317,9,5,0,6/21/2011,"Geno's Staeks are already part of Philly's history. You've never been to Philadelphia if you have not been to Geno's. For beginners, you can first try their Steak Sandwich at arnd 8$. It's best with cheese fries anda bottle of Soda. but for me, I alwasys go for the AMERICAN CHEESESTEAK SANDWICH. It's definitely a good old Philly Cheesesteak! I live in NY but once in a while a drive all the way to Philly and visit Geno's Steaks!!!"
6318,9,5,0,4/27/2011,"Genos is hands down the best cheese steak in Philly, and I have had a bunch of them. ˜Never disappointed!"
6319,9,5,0,9/23/2010,This place is yummy. ˜ Who is this chic on here saying its so bad? ˜Go to mcdonalds.
6320,9,5,0,5/9/2010,"Geno's all the way. ˜what's that other place called, again??"
6321,9,5,0,5/1/2010,Tasty steak and a very neat & clean environment.
6322,9,5,0,4/17/2010,"You don't get better Philly cheasesteaks. ˜Pats is a close second, but nothing compares to the Wiz With at Geno's."
6323,9,5,0,4/8/2010,Pat's vs Geno's.... and the winner is Geno's. Much better experience
6324,9,5,0,3/19/2010,"GENO's by far is the best steak sandwich in the country. The meat is great and they cook it just perfect. The bread is the best bread you can get. I guess that's why they sell about a million steaks a year. ˜The meat is not precooked as some of those Californian's might say. Just because you get your sandwich within 20 seconds doesn't mean it's not fresh. Geno's beef is freshly cooked and as fresh as you can get. They move their sandwiches so fast that they have no time to wait for an order before they start putting meat on the grill. I mean it folks there is always a line, and usually a very long one that moves at the fastest pace you'll ever see. The average total time between ordering your steak and getting it is between 20 to 30 seconds. What place would you think had fresher beef the one that has last weeks beef in the frig because their business is slow, or a place like Geno's where the meat moves so fast that the meat purveyor is constantly on the move to keep up with Geno's pace. Also, when you're moving steaks at Geno's pace you don't have time to be answering everyone's stupid quesions AND get 4,000 steaks out a day. Oh you'll see it there. You'll be in line with over a hundred people and you'll get one inconsiderate knuckle head who wants to tie up the line asking stupid questions. The people at Geno's are not rude, the person holding up the line is. If you hear someone irate about the treatment by Geno's you can be assured that there were 100 people behind them that are happy that that person was either kicked out of line or given directions on how to order so the line could start moving. At Geno's, If you are the 100th person in line you are looking at the most ˜about a 20-25 minute wait before you actually get your sanwich. That's incredible. How much conversation do you think you will have when it takes between 20-30 seconds to order your sandwich, pay for it, and get it. Is it even possible to have conversation in such a limited time frame? My point is, anyone who says that they are rude at Geno's is probably the person who had 100 irate people in line behind them. And as for the order in English sign, you don't have to order in English but whatever you get you're stuck with. One of the reasons the place sells so many steaks is because the line moves fast. When I am hungry, I am hungry, and there is not a food in the world that I am going to wait in line 2 hours for, not even my favorite place Geno's, and Geno's knows that most people don't like waiting in long lines. It's business, and it's good business. When I go to Geno's I'm not looking to have small talk with the cashier, I'm looking to eat. You want small talk go to a sandwich place in California where the food might suck, but you get to make small talk with a waitress in a mini skirt and on roller skates. And for those of you who think they paid $8 for a steak at Geno's but complain that the sandwich wasn't packed with meat. I know one thing, when I go to Geno's I know what I am eating thinly sliced Rib-Eye Beef. Have you ever priced rib eye beef? And this is small Rib-Eye from younger steer. I wonder if these people even know what what they are getting when they get that sandwich that is loaded with chopped meat? ˜I guarantee you that they have no idea but only judge the steak by the size and they know nothing abou the quality. And folks, don't listen to anyone who says they get a better sandwich in San Francisco. The bread is horrible out there and we all know that that's as important as the quality of beef. Outside of the Chicago, Boston, New York and Philadelphia areas, Philadelphia being the best of them, you can not even come close to getting good sandwich bread anywhere else."
6325,9,5,0,4/30/2009,"Been eating Geno's Steaks for years, carried them home on flights to Atlanta, flown up with my family to have them for breakfast. ˜Even watched my son slip on the ice one winter when we were up there having stakes for breakfast and crashed to the ground, his steak held high in the air as he proudly declared ""I saved the steak, at least I saved the steak."" ˜Yep, that's how good they are. Mark McDonald and David McDonald"
6326,9,5,0,2/18/2009,"Geno's has far better food and service than Pats, and is much more respectable. It is clean and looks good on the outside, not worn down and dirty. And as far as Joey Vento being a ""lizard just trying to take your money"", i can attest that he is a great guy and doesn't pull all of his stunts for business. His support for Danny Faulkner is justified. One of Philly's finest was shot cold-blooded by a ruthless criminal. There is mad evidence to support it. Aside from that, he has a brick laid for every Philadelphia Police Officer or Firefighter killed in the line of duty. On both sides of the establishment are boards laden with Police patches from around the nation. ˜He is a strong supporter of our troops and police forces. ˜My father is a police officer, and has been personally invited inside Geno's by Joey Vento himself. ˜He said the inside is incredibly clean, and Vento was a real nice guy. ˜So what if he states his opinion? Its his business, and his opinions are correct. People are just too afraid to recognize it."
6327,9,5,0,12/28/2008,I LOVE Geno's steaks. ˜I thought Pats was ok until I tried Geno's. I really like it here and I eat it every time I come to Philly . One of few things that my family agrees on is that these steaks are AWESOME.
6328,9,5,0,1/16/2007,"For some reason, this was removed, so I will repost it... ""Okay a beloved police officer died because of a foreigner and you own some harley's across the street. Doesn;t matter to me. Get some class and better food. "" I love Geno's but I just wanted to say...it's ironic that you chastise someone to get some class when you make a statement like that. (HAHA the irony!) I'm sure I speak not only for Geno's customers but for most people around here when I say not to come back. P.S. Officer Faulkner wasn't killed by a foreigner. This case is actually a fairly famous event in other places besides this area, so I'm quite shocked that someone of your knowledge capacity didn't already know all of the facts. Next time you decide to sound like you are better than someone, please get your facts straight. Thank You. P.P.S. The Cheesesteaks are great!"
6329,9,5,0,3/4/2006,Geno's is where it's at... awesome hot sauce
6330,9,5,0,11/28/2005,"What can I say? The cheeseteaks are amazing! If you haven't tried it yet, do so. You'll like it. It's a great taste."
6331,9,1,1,1/9/2015,"This is place is just as mediocre as the sports teams of Philadelphia. Need to have a ton of ketchup and hot sauce just to give the cheese steak some flavor. The only thing amusing about this place is the ""This is America when ordering SPEAK ENGLISH"" I had to take a picture next to that sign because that would cause of slew of protest around other parts of the U.S. but I don't think anyone would care since I bet majority of the protest signs probably won't be composed of English words."
6332,9,1,1,1/6/2015,"Rude, Rude, Rude service. ˜Not to mention, have racist signs taped to the window where you order. Seriously, what is wrong with you people?"
6333,9,4,1,1/5/2015,A co-worker and I did the side by side challenge with Geno's and another well known Cheese Steak Place and we both agreed that Geno's was a better ˜sandwich. Cost wasn't too rough and no wait at all.
6334,9,4,1,1/5/2015,"Respectable cheesesteak, but not as good as Pat's."
6335,9,4,1,1/4/2015,"Good quality ingredients, tasty meat with fresh rolls and savory onions. They know how to put a steak sandwich together and have all of that down. The place is amazingly clean inside and out (something to be proud of props to clean) and the staff are friendly if you have any questions they were eager to respond. So what I read alot about the Geno's and Pats experience is that folks are expecting a cheesesteak epiphany because these places get alot of build up from locals and the expectation level is beyond real. Lets start with a cheesesteak being a very simple sandwich with basic ingredients. How you put the pieces together largely determines the outcome. Geno's has a very good product and we are lucky to have so many steak choices in Philly. For me I like to embrace that diversity and when introducing a newcomer, let them find which style of cheesesteak they like. Geno's is good and so are others, i have my favorite and hope you find yours. This is a great place to start your journey to steak nirvana."
6336,9,1,1,1/4/2015,been there done that. will never do it again. you have to stand in one line for a sandwich then stand in another for fries and drink. the sandwich was flat. hardly any meat. no seasoning. mostly bread. the worst steak and cheese ever. i would say subway or the guys in the mall ˜are better. Philly home of the cheese steak or not? bring cash they don't accept credit.
6337,9,1,1,1/3/2015,"I would give this place zero stars if I could. I was so excited to try Genos and Pats when I went to philly. I decided to go to Geno's first because it was closer to me than Pat's. I was sooo disappointed when I tried the first bite. The meat was super dry and the bread was cold and chewy. The whole sandwich was cold and was a waste of my money. I couldn't even take a decent picture to put up with my yelp review. It looked horrible too. There was grease dripping at the end of my sandwich and the grease was getting hard and becoming a clear white substance as it got colder and colder. Therefore, I didn't even want to go over to Pat's to try another disgusting cheese steak, but I'm glad that last minute I went over to Pat's to give them a try! Definitely worth the walk over the street. Not only was the food horrible, the service was even worst. There was a very rude girl in the front. Never going here to waste my money again."
6338,9,2,1,1/2/2015,"Geno's has reached the pinnacle of mediocrity, when it comes to Philadelphia cheese steaks. Geno's still does not offer mushrooms, skimps on onions and cheese, and worst of all, the steaks seem like they are cooked using Steak-ums...I will never come back here, since Dallesandros steaks and service are far better than Geno's and any other place I have tried in the city..."
6339,9,1,1,1/1/2015,"While visiting Philadelphia we decided to try out both Geno's Steaks as well as Pat's. We stood in the line for this steak shop to be dissapointed when we finally got our sandwiches. The first issue we had here was that the staff was rude and short. I get it that you want to get the line moving quickly, but how about a ""hello"" or something more than ""ya"". The steak was greasy, the bread was hard, and the price was ridiculous for the finished product. Pat's was superior to this shop. In the end the only redeeming factor about this restaurant is that it served it's purpose in filling our tummies with average steak and cheese. The next time we visit Philly we may try this spot again, but we will have to see how disappointed we are preparedto be. Last note, your right, this is America but don't forget that this is a country of immigrants so how about you show some respect and remove those ridiculous signs from your storefront."
6340,9,5,1,12/31/2014,"Love this cheesesteak shop! ˜Whole, but not chopped steak, fresh sandwich roll and great service! ˜Of course, you have to know how to order, but my ""one, wit provolone"" really hit the spot after a drive from Jersey City, NJ! ˜Will definitely be a repeat customer when in Philly!"
6341,9,3,1,12/30/2014,"Disappointing to say the least. Confused on how this place is so popular when the cheese steak is so average... Also had the cheese fries which were nothing to write home about. At the end of the day I've found much better cheesesteaks in my last two cities, Tampa and Seattle. Get it together Philly."
6342,9,2,1,12/29/2014,"Myself and 3 friends decided to do a cheesesteak taste tour of Philly to determine which place had the best cheesesteak. We picked the top 5 yelp locations, went to each one on concession, ordered exactly the same item at each place (cheesesteak with Provolone cheese and grilled onions), split it in 4 and gave our verdict. Findings as follows (in order of preference): #1 - Sonny's: soft bread, delicious cheese and flavorful meat. Our absolute fave. Next time we'd consider asking for more cheese to make it even more perfect. #2 - Pat's: a close 2nd. In comparison to Sonny's, the bread was slightly chewier, the cheese was more prominent tasting (an advantage over Sonny's), the onions tasteful but the meat was slightly greasier. #3 - Ishkabibble: the meat was on the dryer side and lacking in cheese quantity. Bread was decent and chewy. Flavor was decent. #4 - Geno's: food was a little bland and on the greasier side. Despite this, the cheesesteak was still tastey, but not our top choice. #5 - Jim's: the greasiest of all the cheesesteaks with the blandest meat. I would skip. Hopefully our little taste testing endeavor will help anyone visiting Philly for a brief time, looking to try the best cheesesteaks this city has to offer."
6343,9,4,1,12/29/2014,"When we were in Philadelphia, we had to get the Philly Cheesesteak. We went to Geno's on the first day and the the classic steak with the Cheeze Whiz and it was very flavorful. Their bread is what won it for me between Pat's (across the street). But it's very close. Any local that says they are a tourist trap is right because there will be a lot of them there but they are also better than the ""local steak"" places."
6344,9,3,1,12/28/2014,3rd stop on our top 10 cheesesteaks of philly mission. ˜Ive been here many times. This was my 1st ever ˜cheesesteak experience along with pat's. I tend to usually pick genos so I already knew what to expect here. As with all cheesesteak places expect a line. They are also cash only. I still like this place a lot. They make a good cheesesteak but at least now I know I have other options. ˜If you've never had obe I would say give this ace a try. They are ontbe top 5.
6345,9,3,1,12/27/2014,"After seeing Genos on T.V. and how the locals raved about how delicious the steak sandwiches were I decided to take a red eye to genos. I arrived there on a weekday in the evening and there were no customers in line. Ordered my sandwich expecting flavorful, juicy, delicious steak. And to my disappointment it was just average. No juices flowing down my arms, no jump out of my seat reaction, no ""GOD DAMN THIS SH.. IS GOOD"". Just an average dry steak sandwich. Next time in Philly I will be trying Tony Lukes."
6346,9,2,1,12/27/2014,"This is my second time visiting, and I reaffirm my opinion that this place is just okay. I find it better than Pat's with the meat texture better and less greasy, but there are many other places serving the same food in Philadelphia, only better. And for some reason, the meat tasted under seasoned when we went yesterday. Maybe they forgot the salt? In my opinion, ˜this is just an average place made popular by great marketing via a combination of food network and rivalry; a place for tourists. Ironically, there's a sign demanding patrons speak English. So, maybe this isn't a good place for international travelers with limited English fluency. Cash only."
6347,9,1,1,12/23/2014,"A Philadelphia classic spot, but.....Only vegetarian cheesesteaks make my menu. ˜No thanks. ˜Meat eating friends enjoy their's though, but same as Pat's and many others in area. Govinda's, Hip City Veg, and so many others that are better, to me."
6348,9,3,1,12/17/2014,"Meh. Not too impressed.So I had to do the Pat's vs Geno's taste test for myself after seeing it on The Travel Channel.Lets start with the building.....it looks like Snooki & Jwoww live there.VERY GAUDY.If they put the effort they put into making the outside of the building gaudy into their Cheesesteaks then maybe their Cheesesteaks would be really good.I ordered a Cheesesteak add Provolone,American and onions.The bread was really chewy compared to Pat's and the meat was very dry.The meat to bread ratio just wasn't right either,there was just too much dry, chewy bread & too little meat.At one point while I was chewing a bite I felt like I had cotton mouth.(Beleive me,that's not a good feeling.) There was definitely less meat and cheese on my Geno's cheesesteak & overall the sandwich was just bigger at Pat's. I know that there are waaay better cheesesteak places than these 2 in Philly because we asked some locals but I had to do the ""touristy taste test ""thing for myself.The results are in, and the winner is..........Pat's. Next time I come to Philly I won't be coming to either one of these just because I wanna go try other places but if you absolutely had to choose from these 2 then it's definitely Pat's hands down."
6349,9,1,1,12/15/2014,"Geno's uses frozen, gristle-laden steak. At least, that is what it tastes like. I used to be a chef at an expensive restaurant, so I know what I am talking about. Far superior alternatives are Pat's, Joe's Steak and Soda Shop (formerly Chink's), and Tony Luke's."
6350,9,2,1,12/15/2014,"What else is there to say about Geno's? ˜A mediocre tourist destination for expensive and sub par cheesesteaks. ˜Definitely not worth the wait in line. ˜ Granted, after a long night of drinking, anything this greasy will taste good and help you sober up. ˜ If you are in this neighborhood, do yourself a favor and skip Pat's and Geno's and go over to Jim's. ˜Sure, Jim's is still a tourist spot, but it's a lot better."
6351,9,2,1,12/11/2014,"2 stars is being polite. 1st off the service sucked. Idiot blurted out the order and ended with ""yeah homes"" so he could know a Mexican was ordering. I said you people talk like that here. He said ""yeah."" I rhink not asshole! I'm from L.A. so no you don't. I could have pulled his bitch ass through the window and given him an LAPD beatdown. After driving through the hood I see Mexican food spots which explains the racist signs. 2nd the steak was tough and the bread sucked. I went to Pat's to compare. I know the locals don't come here or to Pat's but hands down Pat's. Now I know why people say why most East Coasters are rude. Come to Cali and see how far that attitude gets you. Hopefully I'll be the one you meet!"
6352,9,2,1,12/10/2014,"Philly... ˜ ˜ Check Cheese... Check Steak... ˜ ˜Check Worth the Hype...I think not How could I not visit The City of Brotherly Love without a trip to South Philly for a matchup between cheesesteak rivals? On a recent Sunday morning I managed to avoid the crowds, in fact I was one of only three people in line. Armed with the knowledge of the precise ordering process...One, wit, whiz...and cash in hand I felt thoroughly prepared for a toe to toe cheesesteak face-off. Was my sandwich bad? No. Was it amazing or worth a repeat visit? It was not. The steak was tender but lacked any real flavor. The whiz was warm and melty but nothing exciting. Overall it was a pretty mediocre sandwich but an interesting experience none the less. If you're in Philly I'd still recommend visiting and comparing for yourself. Why not say you have visited the birthplace of cheesesteak?"
6353,9,3,1,12/6/2014,Had a local take us as he states back in the day it was the best but now just a tourist thing to say you did. It's OK. Can't say much.
6354,9,3,1,12/3/2014,"3.5 stars. This joint and pats are the most famous cheese steak joints in Philadelphia and there are key differences between the two, pats does not cut up their steak while genos does. Both provide an authentic Philadelphia experience!!! Though I prefer pats, genos is very good as well... Neither are the best. But If you go to Pats, you might as well go to Genos too in order to compare. Genos is a little flashier in their decor. Signs they have can be offensive to non Americans and employees are not noted for their kindness so know how to order... Or they well be extra rude- that's the Philly way. Get the wiz with. Cash only."
6355,9,4,1,11/30/2014,"Dont know why the overall rating is so low, but I love this place. The cheese steak is really great, only bad side is it's kinda dry. But it's better than my expectations and I would definitely recommend people to come here for Philly cheese steak!"
6356,9,2,1,11/29/2014,"Nope. Geno's just doesn't hold a candle to Pat's. Maybe it's the bread (it tastes really chewy) or the sign that says ""This is America, please speak English"" and ""I want my country back,"" but it just doesn't do it for me like Pat's does. Who would have thought a grandchild of Italian immigrants would be so intolerant? Just head across the street to Pat's for a really good Philly cheesesteak experience, minus the hypocrisy."
6357,9,1,1,11/28/2014,The most disgusting Philly Cheese Stake i've ever had! Froze ourselves to death for this garbage that we placed in to the dumpster immediately!
6358,9,4,1,11/27/2014,"After a year of living in Philly I promised to break my Vegetarian fast only to eat at Genos Steaks because of the fame, and notoriety from the Boyz II Men MowtownPhilly video in the 1990's. ˜The service was kind, and the steak sandwich tasted like a steak sandwich. ˜It had Cheese, Steak, Beef and bread the end. I felt good having gone to 9th street and Passyunk on a nice day. The worker even let me take a photo of him after I asked."
6359,9,2,1,11/24/2014,Came here after the philly marathon as i was craving philly cheesesteaks. The cheesesteaks were okay. ˜Nothing really special. I have had better in other places. Also sucks there's no indoor seating when it gets colder. But the fries were good.
6360,9,1,1,11/23/2014,Overrated I came here hoping to eat a tasty Sandwich and it was far from it just plain and with no flavor. The lady that takes your order seems like she hasn't smiled in decades completely disappointed.
6361,9,2,1,11/23/2014,"This is part of the Crusade for Greatest Cheesesteak in Philadelphia trip I did. Geno's Steaks was the 6th stop on our list. The rivalry between Pat's and Geno's is well known. They have loyal fans of each who just believe one is better than the other. When we got there the line at Geno's was long and slow moving. People complain about the political things on the establishment and what I would say to them is don't go there. There is the sign that says this is America order in English, yes it can be offensive but again don't go there. I think any establishment knows if they outwardly support or make claims about certain political and racial things some people wont and some will support them. But this review is about cheese steaks not d?cor, go read a glamour magazine if you want to take about their averse wallpapering. Geno's cheese steaks have never been a favorite of mine. I think there meat is ok and there cheese is lacking. The people behind the counter can be edgy maybe it's from the long lines and customers, but still I'm patronizing your business."
6362,9,2,1,11/21/2014,"I lost my Cheesesteak virginity at Jim's and after a few times wanted to see what else life has to offer. ˜Did Pat, did Tony and now I finally did Geno. ˜The grass is not always greener, or in this case meatier. ˜I hope my 1st love Jim's will take me back after breaking up with him. I'm so sorry. Those other guys are all show and no go. Jim's is King."
6363,9,3,1,11/19/2014,"Stopped in here during our recent trip to Philly, we had the cheesteak w/ American cheese & onions. It was okay, nothing to really brag about but everyone stops here when their in Philly so why not?? On a night of drinking I'm sure we'll be back otherwise, ˜probably not."
6364,9,1,1,11/14/2014,"Gross, chewy bread and racism served up hot. How can you have a sign that says, ""This is America - ˜we speak English!"" when your staff doesn't understand an order unless it's phrased ""2 whiz wit!"" Go to Jim's."
6365,9,2,1,11/12/2014,"I was in the area and decided to stop in and try a cheesesteak. ˜I was not really impressed with what I got. ˜The bread was a little too chewy for my liking. ˜The meat was decent, but kind of dry. ˜I did order the sandwich with provolone, so that might have been a factor for the dryness. ˜This place is definitely worth a try due to the history, but that is about all."
6366,9,1,1,11/11/2014,Meh. I don't get the hype of this place or the ˜other one across the street. ˜I took my teenager and her friend (visiting from Italy) here and regretted it. ˜Very much a tourist trap with cheesesteaks that taste like the assembly line that they came off of. ˜If you want a real taste of Philly go to the reading terminal and get a roast pork sandwich with broccoli rabe and provolone from DeNic's. YUM. ˜Or go to any truck and order a cheesesteak. It will be fresher tasting than this place.
6367,9,3,1,11/5/2014,"So according to a lot of reviews here they say that Geno's is a rude and can be a racist establishment. I didn't experience that . I went at about 9pm with my Indian pal and there was zero rudeness or racism toward my friends accent. So very pleasant experience. ˜Keep in mind that it was late and nearly empty so the level of stress wasn't displayed amongst the employees which can happen in fast paced hours. Anyhow, the Steak Sandwiches were OK. Not out of this world. Average. But I suppose my curiosity got the best of me. So if your in tourist mode and you just need to go. Fine. ˜ But it's not the best. Sorry to disappoint. And neither is Pat's right across the street. Just helping you not waste time."
6368,9,2,1,11/3/2014,"Xenophobia and racism aside, Geno's is still sub-par at best."
6369,9,2,1,11/3/2014,"This was our first authentic Philly cheesesteak experience. We figured when in Philly, you can't pass up the opportunity to try a with whiz Philly. Geno's certainly captures your attention with it's flashy signs and boisterous lighting. The woman that took the order was unfriendly. Food was quick, which made sense because it was also sloppy and cold. I tried it without any additions. It was okay. I decided to add hot sauce, relish, ketchup and some hot cherry peppers. Much better with condiments to mask the lackluster taste of the cold meat and cheese sandwich. I give it two stars because it tasted better than Pat's, but the service was rude and I wouldn't return. Cash only and way overpriced for the quality. See my review on Pat's for a comparison."
6370,9,1,1,11/3/2014,"Just as shitty as Pat's, but served with a side of xenophobic racism. ˜Thanks for all the light pollution in my neighborhood, Geno's."
6371,9,4,1,11/3/2014,love this place great to bring visitors from out of town. really get a feel for Philadelphia this way. Something is always happen here. always buzzing.
6372,9,1,1,11/1/2014,The cheesesteaks are okay. Pats are better. There are other good spots in the area. This is a tourist trap to avoid. They seem to be proudly/openly xenophobic and/or racist. what's up with that???
6373,9,4,1,11/1/2014,i wish that you could sit down and eat food was good
6374,9,1,1,10/30/2014,No amount of neon and flash will make what they pass for a cheese steak any good. ˜There are SO many good cheese steak options in the city and none of them are anywhere near this intersection.
6375,9,2,1,10/29/2014,"I am being generous with two stars. So disappointed to have finally got to Philly and get over to Geno's or Pat's...try it and be utterly underwhelmed. Should have asked locals where to go rather than be drawn in to the ""famous"" places. ˜I grew up in Venice, CA and we have a little hoagie shop there that claims to be just like Philly's..now I can compare and say I will stick with Venice's version. Geno's obviously has high turnover and they care very little about quality versus rushing a sandwich out the window. I ordered a steak sandwich with provolone, onions, mushrooms and peppers. In under 2 minutes our sandwich was handed to us. In Venice, you have a good 10 minute wait as it is made fresh FOR YOU! The steak is cooked as you order with the cheese melted on top. The onions and peppers and mushrooms freshly grilled to order. This means the meat is not rubbery and dry because it was cooked long ago. The cheese is actually melted into the meat and nice and hot because it was JUST cooked. This provolone was barely noticable and partially melted because it had warm already cooked meat thrown on top of that. No flavor to the onions, peppers and mushrooms that were a bit undercooked probably in large quantities and set aside for hours. The bread was too much..a chewy sourdough like roll rather than a french style which yes would get soggy but you eat it fast enough when it is fresh and hot. Also, like other patrons..turned off by the ""It's America, order in english"". Whoever owns (ed) Geno's surely had relatives who came from another country speaking another language. This is a melting pot..why such hate? Just such a negative thing to post up...racist attitude prevails in neighborhood or just a racist owner?? The whole experience....MEH!!!! Keep your cheesesteaks..I will just enjoy them in Venice when I go there. Even the chain here in my area called Philly Cheesesteak Co. is better and fresher than what I tasted here."
6376,9,5,1,10/29/2014,I don't eat red meat but when I do its a cheese steak from ginos in south philly a must for a bucket list.
6377,9,3,1,10/28/2014,"Kudos for finding a parking spot right in front of the place. Even better was that I only had a five minute wait. I suppose it was the time of day? Either way, I was pleased to finally try this place out. This, however, wasn't a disappointment but I wasn't blown away, either. I can't remember the name of the coffee shop next door but they do allow you to bring your cheesesteak over to eat inside if you made a purchase. A drink or coffee would suffice. All the outdoor seats were full and it started to rain so this was a great option. Had this been my only cheesesteak in the two days I visited AC/Philly I would probably rate this visit four stars. It was good but I felt after having one of their competitors the day before I felt like there was more to be desired. It was juicy, healthy in size but I felt the hype I've had over the years just wasn't there. I would say that I felt this place to be very commercialized from what all my friends have told me. These folks were a lot nicer than others made them out to be. The dude in the coffee shop gave us the lingo to use so we didn't look like chumps when ordering. Still good, not great, but certainly worth trying..."
6378,9,5,1,10/27/2014,better than pats and always a fun time waiting in line with others who are getting ready to enjoy one of the best cheesesteaks in philly
6379,9,5,1,10/26/2014,"Oh yeah this place is doing it right. Steak is good, cheese has flavor, bread is toasted. All in all a steak sandwich done right. Tip: bring cash, cash only."
6380,9,1,1,10/26/2014,"Certainly not the best anymore but an ""institution"" none the less."
6381,9,4,1,10/26/2014,"I went to Geno's in an attempt to see which classic restaurant does the cheesesteak better. For me, the winner was definitely Geno's. This place has their service down to a science as the line is usually long, but the wait times to get your food are lightning quick. The meat at Geno's really puts this sandwich over the top. It is very tender and flavorful and goes well with all the toppings. One complaint I have is that I wish they put more of the cheese sauce and toppings on the sandwich because that really makes the sandwich. Otherwise, it was a delicious sandwich and worth checking out if you visit that famous intersection."
6382,9,3,1,10/22/2014,Good. Just not as good as Pat's.
6383,9,1,1,10/22/2014,"One word - YUCK!! This place must make their money strictly based on being a tourist trap. And I do mean trap! Because unfortunately the hearsay will cause you to believe you must try a philly cheese steak from here. Well, I'm writing to tell you, DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!!! Nope! I tasted my sandwich and looked around thinking, is this a joke?!! It was just that bad. Cheese whiz though? Really? Smh I struggled through the majority of it because I did not want to waste my money. That really sucks! Never again though. Only takes one time for me to learn a lesson in nasty food!"
6384,9,4,1,10/21/2014,yum always great to eat a philly cheesesteak here! ˜a famous place & even if there is a line they are on the ball & wait on everyone quickly.
6385,9,2,1,10/19/2014,"Not great, but while in Philly as a tourist I had to go here as well as Pat's. I liked Genos better than Pat's, but only marginally. I had a simple beef with cheese whiz and no onions. They are cash only FYI. The staff are pretty blunt and have an attitude but I suppose it adds to the experience."
6386,9,1,1,10/18/2014,"Poor imitation of Pat's. Staff is equally as rude and abrasive. I tried their food only hoping that it would be better than Pat's, but that was a mistake. The bread is cold and stale. The sandwich was smaller than Pat's and had no taste. I found out later that the better steak sandwiches were elsewhere in Philly."
6387,9,2,1,10/18/2014,"not bad. But personally i am a Pat's steak fan. Unless my steak was drench in cheese, the meet was super dry. I might give it another chance if i ever again visit down there."
6388,9,2,1,10/16/2014,you're paying for the name
6389,9,3,1,10/15/2014,"Second best steak wit wiz. the difference is the staff are actually not a holes, and really quite nice. but the place across the street is tastier despite the a holes behind the dome"
6390,9,3,1,10/15/2014,"I try to like Geno's but I can't. ˜Every time I get a ch stk (provy wit) it doest taste good, like no taste. ˜It would be the same if I put cardboard in the roll. ˜I always like their ch fries though. ˜Got one last week to go, get home, and its a half cup of fries! ˜ You charge 5 bucks for frozen fries with some cheese wiz, you can at least give me a full order of fries. ˜ Only reason I'm giving it 3 stars is that its the cleanest food business i've ever seen, place is spotless. ˜You can eat off the floor its that freakin clean."
6391,9,2,1,10/15/2014,"I don't get it. ˜Great drunk food, or a quick sandwich on your way out of town. ˜Philly is starved for good restaurants if this place is as good as it gets for sandwiches. ˜WAY too overpriced for a lot of bread too. ˜The cheese whiz version is way to greasy and hard to eat without making a mess. Only option is onions. ˜ Yes, tourist trap."
6392,9,4,1,10/14/2014,Taking the walk across the street I had the opportunity to take the Philly cheese steak challenge. In my personal opinion I think everything from the way the steak was cut down to the roll was better at Geno's. Make sure you know how to order when you go because they will give you crap if you don't.
6393,9,4,1,10/14/2014,"Geno's Steak.....if you're having Geno's, might as well try Pat's cheesesteak since it's across from one another. Seems to be more modern in terms of the set up, from the cash register up to the store front. The long line and long tradition makes it worth while."
6394,9,4,1,10/7/2014,"The best cheesesteak I've ever had. Fast friendly service. I'd come here everyday if I lived nearby. ˜ Place is very clean but I gave them 1 less star for using ammonia glass cleaner, smells horrible while eating and enjoying my cheesesteak."
6395,9,1,1,10/6/2014,"So neither Pat's or Geno's are really all that good. There are like 20 places within spitting distance that are better. They are simply famous. That being said they are ""stops on the tour"" so if you're visiting - get a steak at both and decide for yourself. I would say that the actual quality at Geno's is generally less than stellar although the line is generally shorter and they have better seating. Also while you almost want to like the big, neon gaudiness of Geno's to give it an edge over Pat's - it's more than a little goofy... especially when you get to weird almost religious posters and such. And if you look around for a minute odds are you're going to see something slightly racist (be it an offensive sign or confederate flag). All for free speech, but like most folks in the NE metro area...I am probably going to exercise my own rights and take my business to a place that is either less outwardly racist - or at least has the common business sense to keep it to themselves."
6396,9,2,1,10/5/2014,"Nope. ˜Go to Pat's across the street for better quality meat, more cheesesteak options on the menu, and way better fries."
6397,9,3,1,10/5/2014,"Not as good as Steve's, but if you are in the area, it's worth it... ˜tourist trap wit' or without'"
6398,9,1,1,10/4/2014,Real Philidelphians don't eat here. Genos is for tourists who don't know any better or see their crappy obnoxious lights. Ask around the city to locals for a better place
6399,9,4,1,10/4/2014,"Genos or Pats? I like Genos better personally. Pats used to be great but if you read my review of them, they cheaped out on us and the usual poor customer service has surprisingly gotten worse (as if that were possible). Genos is a HUGE tourist stop along the Philly sightseeing tours. But, if you're Philly home grown, you know when to go and when to stay away. They have great steaks, even if you do have to seek a second mortgage in order to cover the cost. Yes, it's creepin up to nearly $10 for a cheesesteak. Bottom line, it's a treat, not something you allow yourself to eat everyday, so go get one and enjoy."
6400,9,2,1,10/2/2014,Tourist trap. ˜Outstanding cheese fries though.
6401,9,3,1,10/1/2014,"Nothing to rave about, it is a typical Greek run restaurant with nice service. Food is above ok, but not what I would call excellent. Nice place to take a date and have a first meeting."
6402,9,3,1,9/30/2014,"Good, but certainly not the best in Philly area. Go there for the scenery and comradery after a game or show...or just a long night of drinking."
6403,9,2,1,9/29/2014,"I was in Philly a few days ago and heard about this place. Iit was very disappointing. These guys seem to be riding their name, the steak was dry and the cheese almost non existent. My girlfriend and I shared one sandwich and had to throw half away... I would definitely NOT recommend."
6404,9,5,1,9/28/2014,"Amazing! I took a ride down to Pennsylvania with my girlfriend & my cousin we all where starving & my cousin told me about this place, so we went there I eneded up getting 2 cheese steaks because they where just so good, line was long but it moved fast & quick! dont forget to the fries lol"
6405,9,3,1,9/27/2014,Geno's is definitely a Philadelphia icon but the steaks really are just average. They seem to be giving less steak in their sandwiches over the years as well but maybe its just in my head :P If you have a friend visiting from out of town take them there! But as your everyday cheese steak I'd visit your local pizza shop
6406,9,2,1,9/25/2014,We arrived here just after midnight and had no difficulty finding a place to park or a place to sit down and eat. ˜The tables line the sidewalk. I ordered the cheesesteak; what else is a tourist to do? ˜Maybe I was expecting something different I am from Jersey... it was disappointing. ˜The cheesesteak has chucks of steak that were exceptionally chewy and the cheese that failed to improve the overall experience. It didn't have a particular flavor that stood out and it was honestly forgettable except for the prices. It is expensive. ˜In a city full of flavor and variety.... I will try somewhere else next time.
6407,9,2,1,9/24/2014,Way too expensive for what you get. You can pay less elsewhere and get better food. Not all it's cracked up to be.
6408,9,3,1,9/23/2014,"When in Philly, one must try an authentic PHILLY CHEESESTEAK SANDWICH!!!!!! I didn't though because I don't eat beef. I came here with two other friends whom are both huge carnivores and foodies. They got the philly cheesesteak (And also learned how to order it with melted cheese. It's called with wist? Or something like that haha) and I got a pork sandwich (with wist again.) The pork was okay! Wasn't spectacular, wasn't extremely flavored. But the vibes made up for it. Everyone was so enthusiastic about these sandwiches! The line also wasn't incredulously long too, so no one was grouchy. Overall, worth the try!! Especially if you aren't from Philly like me."
6409,9,3,1,9/23/2014,Decided to go to Geno's verus Pat's two weeks ago while in Philly. ˜That might have been a mistake. The sandwich was mostly bread and lacked flavor. The cheese fries were okay. We were lucky enough to get a little table but I was just not that impressed. Wish I could've tried Pat's too!
6410,9,5,1,9/23/2014,"I'm doing a similar review for these two rivals - I loved Geno's and Pat's. They were both amazing!! Four of us went to try both of these amazing cheesesteaks, two of us got Geno's and two of us got Pat's then we just split them. We all went back and fourth on which one we liked better but both were great. Geno's bread was so fresh and had a pretzel like texture to the outside. They put the cheese on first and then the meat with onions. The meat was so juicy and I loved how the cheese sunk right into that delicious bread. You have to try these two if you are in Philly!"
6411,9,3,1,9/23/2014,"Geno's is a great spot, for the experience that it. ˜Whether stopping by after a sporting event or a long night of drinking, Geno's will be there to serve you. ˜No, it's not the best cheese steak in the city, not even by a long shot. ˜But when someone I know comes to visit the city for their first time, the experience is worth the trip alone."
5058,9,2,1,9/22/2014,"I'm sorry all of the cheese steak places more or less taste the same, I prefer Jim's mostly because it's less of an eyesore."
6412,9,2,1,9/21/2014,The flavor and lack of chopped preparation for the steak is a letdown for me. ˜Alas. ˜I'll stick with Pat's or Dalessandros.
6413,9,5,1,9/21/2014,"This may seem crazy that I'm giving them a fiver, but, they have something I've never tasted anywhere else: their hot sauce. I only just tried it recently (used leftover container for small portion of food) and am blown away. Not sure if they make it or if it's from a company, but, it is just highly-noxious, tasty, red goodness. If a jalapeno is too hot from you and a long hot would kill ya...stay away. That aside...enjoy. :] End note: I also commend Joey Vento and what he stood for; especially as a South Philadelphian like myself. I'm not an inbred or an old-timer either. In my early 20's and college-educated."
6414,9,2,1,9/21/2014,"I just returned from a road trip to Philly where I had an opportunity to visit Geno's. For those few who don't know. Geno's is a half a block from Pat's. We gave the nod to Geno's as my daughter recently tried both establishments and preferred the roll and onions at Geno's. Although, she wasn't really thrilled with either place. Im must agree. Quite frankly , the Cheesesteaks at a couple of my local home town spots are much better. Puzo's & The Caboose on the Corner, located in Fairfield NJ are both FAR superior in every way. Better roll, better quality & quantity of meat and a much larger variety of custom toppings. I have come to the conclusion that the legendary ""Great Philly Cheesesteak"" is a complete myth. I won't be back."
6415,9,3,1,9/18/2014,"Between the two competitors I chose pats because Genos had grizzly meat with a lot of straight fat, pats meat was very juicy and most of the fast was trimmed off. Also the comparison of bread pats had soft bread while geno's was crusty. Similar in price, andI also liked geno's service a little better. Never the less it's a good food spot to try for tourists."
6416,9,1,1,9/18/2014,Over rated.
6417,9,3,1,9/17/2014,I come here for their Philly Cheese Steak. Honestly i need to say i like their bread but steak...
6418,9,1,1,9/16/2014,Overpriced and nothing special about it. Rather spend that type of money on a large Big Mac and still have money left over for some lotto tickets. Would not recommend anyone to this place. Racist a$$hoIe started the English only bull. Everyone should stop going there. Even the tourist. Cause people from Philly knows their cheesesteaks and know where to go get a good one and that place is not geno's or pat's.
6419,9,2,1,9/15/2014,"I'm sure this place doesn't need my review, but what the heck. ˜Here goes... I was told by several people that I needed to choose between either Pat's or Geno's when visiting Philadelphia. ˜By sheer chance, I ended up going to Geno's. ˜After all the hype, I was really expecting an amazing cheese steak sandwich. ˜In actuality, I thought the sandwich was just alright. ˜I was good, don't get me wrong; but I was expecting a mindblowingly tasty experience of orgasmic proportions based on everything that was told to me. ˜The meat was kind of bland and dry and the overall sandwich was kind of flat. ˜Again, nothing special about it at all. Truth be told, I think I've had a better cheese steak sandwich in Denver of all places. ˜There's a place off of Broadway that I still remember as being pretty amazing to this day after having visited years ago. ˜But who knows, maybe I was just exceptionally hungry when I tried that place."
6420,9,1,1,9/14/2014,"Geno's ""English-only"" sign is ignorant and unwelcoming. The cheesesteak at Pat's (right across the street) tastes better anyway. Although I have to admit, neither Pat's or Geno's was amazingly good."
6421,9,2,1,9/14/2014,Typical tourist steak joint. ˜People from Philadelphia do not eat here unless they are drunk at 3 a.m.
6422,9,4,1,9/13/2014,Pretty good. Way better than Denver. I like Pat's better. It's meatier and they use real Cheez wiz. The meat has something Pat's doesn't. I can't put my figure out what it is. It is a little better here. The service is terrible. They are both fun and a good visit. Best in town is Sonny's.
6423,9,2,1,9/13/2014,Don't waist your time. I'm from Philadelphia ˜my whole life. People only go here because the name.... same with Pats. People if your coming to visit here in the city the food really isn't good and locals do not eat there. South philly has a million really tasty food spots. But Geno's and Pats aren't not one of them. Put it this way I was drunk and hungry with my husband and another couple it was late nothing was opened so we go here I couldn't even eat the food drunk and hungry. That's pretty bad:( however it is in a cool location at 9th street. Oh n be prepared to spend a lot of money $$$$$$$$$
6424,9,5,1,9/13/2014,"I thought my sandwich was delicious, so was hubby's. We each got one with a different cheese so that we could share. The fries were yummy too. What stuck with me more than the food was the attitude of the employees. They were so friendly and funny, that it truly made for a great experience."
6425,9,3,1,9/12/2014,"So...after visiting Pat's, Geno's was my next stop. ˜I made sure to order the same thing I had at Pat's (cheesesteak wit, with provolone) ,except I don't think Geno's has mushrooms.... I got my sandwich and I slowly unwrap it.....and again no magic faeries.....oh well. ˜I don't know....after traveling all this way, I thought there would be some sort of magical aura, but no...just a quickly made cheesesteak. I ate it and found out that I am a Geno's guy. On this particular day, the onion to meat ratio was almost one to one at Geno's. ˜Pat's has meat with a little onion....for me that was the difference. ˜That and the fact that the cheese slices in Geno's were thinner so it melted a little faster...to blend the flavor. ˜The bun was still nice and soft here, but the onions (that have been soaking up flavor juice from the well seasoned grill) made this cheesesteak better. My wife ordered cheese fries and those were good as well. ˜Crunchy fries with soft cheese sauce....good times."
6426,9,1,1,9/11/2014,"Steaks are ok, not the best in Philly at all, but will never go there again because of Joey Vento and his hate mongering when he was alive!!!!!!"
6427,9,2,1,9/10/2014,This place was not what i expected. Beginning with the rudest service from a woman with blonde hair saying nasty comments. This was our first time there and will be our last. Food was OK but should have went to Pats. Two of the servers did not seem like they wanted to be there with the rude stares and comments. I drove over an hour to try this place and i am VERY disappointed. Also it is over rated and in a bad area. Maybe they should live up to There expectation!
6428,9,4,1,9/9/2014,"We took the family for a Geno/Pat test. ˜I'm a GENO's fan ˜YAHOOO, The bread is what made the difference. ˜The people as well ˜I liked the wit'out. ˜Everytime company comes into town we do the Geno/Pat comparison. ˜Geno's wins every time. ˜Oh wait Pat's won with one person from Massachusetts, what do they know up there ˜hmmph they eat boiled dinners! ˜GO GENO's"
6429,9,2,1,9/9/2014,"Food - I honestly liked Geno's Steaks over Pat's because it wasn't as dry and the bread was somewhat crispy. However, I can still see some same problems I had with Pat's at Geno's. The meat was somewhat dry, like it has been sitting on the grill for too long and they had to sell it, unfortunately. They definitely had the better fries compared to Pat's but it was honestly like choosing the better between 2 poisons. Price - A little less expensive than Pat's but I would not come back and pay for that. Service - Slightly better than Pat's but it was definitely not superb. I would not return. So overrated. I was upset at the end."
6430,9,2,1,9/9/2014,"Finally did the cheese steak thing! In comparison of flavor, Pat's wins. Very disappointed in the price to quantity, neither had any meat and was only half a sandwich. Geno's had a more inviting atmosphere and friendlier staff. Meat had a taste of old blood, but the roll was warm and the meat was hot. I'll stick to my South Jersey cheese steaks, Seagraves and Italian Kitchen, you have no competition! Same price, twice the size and tree times the meat!"
6431,9,2,1,9/8/2014,"Geno steaks are not that good , the place is over rated ....if you had to pick a place in south philly I would go with tony lucks at front and Oregon !!!!!"
6432,9,3,1,9/7/2014,"I lived in Philadelphia for about 7 years, and only came here a handful of times. ˜However, I returned this year, after moving to the West Coast and decided to partake in a head to head competition of Pat's versus Geno's. ˜ We ordered a steak sandwich from each, identical wit Wiz and Onions, and then split each one in half and shared. We agreed that we enjoyed Pat's just a bit better. ˜Both had redeeming qualities; however, we thought that Pat's flavor profile was just a bit better than Geno's. ˜ Our opinion; however, both produced a quality steak. ˜ I must say that Geno's gets one less star, despite both being pretty good. ˜We ordered a soda and a steak from Geno's; however, they refused to give us a cup of water, despite purchasing a steak and soda from them. ˜The service on this issue was not really satisfactory."
6433,9,4,1,9/7/2014,"Thought this place was better than Pat's. Bread was fantastic, had more texture and flavor. Steak WAS NOT as grubbie and chewie as Pats. The cheese was more flavorful. We did cheese fries too... Soo good. ˜They only accept cash!!! ˜Be aware! ˜I was pleased and will be back! ˜The steak was so tender wet and savory. Perfectly spiced and nice and salty!"
6434,9,2,1,9/6/2014,"good food, but overrated, ate here a bunch of times, but its really bad for you. they make it very fast because of the long lines and dont really spend time cooking the meat correctly, both pats and geno's are going down the drain"
6435,9,2,1,9/5/2014,"Not that good. When you get to Geno's the first thing you'll notice are the ultra-bright, white neon lights that look like the cross between a cafeteria and an ER waiting room. The cheese steak (I got one with provolone) was limp, semi-cold, and devoid of flavor. I couldn't even tell it had cheese in it. A disappointment. Also, maybe I just don't like whiz, but the fries with whiz were just inedible. On a side note: what's with the sign that warns patrons ""This is America, speak English!""? This just sounds xenophobic. Why so confrontational towards foreigners? Are people who work at Geno's able to speak the local language every time they travel abroad? French fries here are indicated as Freedom Fries on the menu, and I don't think this was a joke. Perhaps Geno's even donated money to return the Statue of Liberty to France at the time of the Iraq invasion. Finally, all the various police emblems, which under other circumstances could have been seen as a colorful, interesting collection, end up contributing to the overall unwelcoming, menacing ambiance. ---------------------------- PS: If, like me, you're planning a nice, long walk from downtown to get to this neighborhood in the evening, think again. Although not necessarily unsafe, you'll walk through dilapidated neighborhoods with completely empty streets before reaching your destination."
6436,9,4,1,9/3/2014,"Geno's is the best out of Pat's and Tony Lukes. The onions are what makes the cheesesteak really good. They could def. add more meat on the sandwich to make it a little better, but always a fan of this place. Advice, don't order slow at the window and know what you want. These people have no patience lol"
6437,9,4,1,9/2/2014,Ok so I talked shit and got bit I admit!!!!!! Was picking a friend up from the airport at 8 p. M and the flight was delayed 3 hours so instead of sitting in the airport I drove into the city I drove first to Geno's steaks thought that the cheese whiz thing was cracked tried it for the first time and it was damn good funny though you can get a steak from one window and you have to go to a different window to get a drink thought that was weird but I like the place it is good go there go there now
6438,9,1,1,9/2/2014,"Not sure what all the hype is about. ˜Yes this place and Pat's got their fame from tv shows and famous celebrities, but famous for their food?....not so much. ˜Geno's seems to get their fame and business from tourism. ˜I was pretty eager to try out an authentic Philly Cheeseteak to see how it matches up with the one local to me back in Cali. ˜First off, the line was wrapped around the block, but the best part was the the line moved very quickly. ˜You get to the window and blurt out your sandwich order and pay 10 bucks to the lady. ˜The sandwich came in 3 minutes, then if you want a drink you have to move down to the next window to order the rest of your meal. (fries and a soda) ˜ ˜ ˜ Ready to eat my sandwich, I unwrap it and it literally looked like a pile of microwaved meat stuck in an an ordinary roll. ˜The bread was tough and chewy inside and out without a hint of toasting or crisp on the outside. ˜Meat was pretty bland and was in small pieces like getting the last of a bag of chips. ˜The only thing I could really taste was the provolone cheese. ˜ In short, tasted like a microwaved frozen sandwich. ˜Also got a LARGE soda, which was about 12 oz or so. ˜I know we americans are overweight, but a Large is a large..and it should be about 20 oz-24 oz minumum esp if you're paying top prices. ˜ ˜ Lastly, also had an order of fries for 4 dollars!! yes $$$$4 DOLLARS!!! Fries are served in a paper cup and look like seasoned fries but aren't so it makes me wonder what kind of oil they use. ˜Ate the first fry and I immediately had that nasty oil/film coating left in my mouth. ˜Felt like plastic melting in my mouth, ˜ ˜A complete tasteless meal for 16 bux, now you know how these guys stay in business with all their shiny lights at night. ˜Someone has to pay for the electric bill. ˜ Don't recommend this place as its a novelty but they will get their share of tourists and i was def one to fall for the tourist trap. ˜ Oh and remember, according to the sign in front, if you don't speak Engrish, then don't bother cuz you're not welcome."
6439,9,1,1,9/1/2014,"I was so excited to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak and spent the entire ride from the airport thinking about a sandwich overflowing with meat, peppers, onions and cheese ""wiz,"" but I was disappointed when it turned out to be more roll than anything else. Very skimpy on the filling, I barely needed a napkin. I was also put off by the ""this is America, please order in English"" sign in their window. I only speak English, but would expect more hospitality and less blatant hostility from a ˜ place so dependent on visits from tourists from all over. If I had noticed the sign before I ordered, I would've taken my business across the street to Pat's."
6440,9,5,1,9/1/2014,"I grew up in PA, but live in Cali now with my husband. I took my family t o east coast and of course my husband had to go here. Service was fast I got a steak sandwich with onions and whiz. Super cheesy and delicious ˜- bread was soft. Steak was more like small round patty's loved it. I actually ate a Pat's steak sandwich at the same time and I was comparing the two and Geno's was cheesier."
6441,9,2,1,9/1/2014,"Not a good steak. Gummy bread. Worse than so-so but not inedible. But what really sets this place apart are the ample side servings of xenophobia and the meaty blobs of crypto-facism. After looking around at the place with its signs proudly claiming not to serve anyone who doesn't speak English, not to mention a collection of badges and buttons that rival a police museum, I was sorry I gave this creepy establishment a dime, let alone $30. But ... it created a lifetime memory between my son and myself. He just kept asking me the whole time after, why is a place like this still in business? Good question son."
6442,9,4,1,8/31/2014,"Honestly, I liked Geno's Steaks out of the ""Big 3"" (Geno's, Pat's, and Tony Luke's) the most. I ordered the cheesesteak with the american cheese and onions. The bread was crisp on the outside while chewy on the inside and the cheese complimented the steak really well. Also keep in mind I also went across the street and had a cheesesteak from Pat's, which was very similar."
6443,9,4,1,8/31/2014,"so good, make sure you know what you want before you get in line"
6444,9,2,1,8/31/2014,"My friends were in town and wanted to experience a Philly Cheesesteak. Of course, they've heard about Geno's and Pat's so I took them there. I personally didn't have high expectations from Geno's because I haven't heard many good things about it. Nevertheless, I did expect a decent cheesesteak from here. I ordered a provolone cheesesteak with onions. Very fast service! I got my cheesesteak in less than two minutes. They sure pound those babies out here! Onto the actual cheesesteak now. I'm not too big a fan of cheesesteaks, so I can't judge them as well as many other people. I've had a few of them to compare Geno's with though. That being said, I was extremely disappointed with my cheesesteak from Geno's. The bread was so chewy and awful. I had to yank it from my mouth to get an actual bite out of it. It wasn't toasted at all and was just stale. The meat was mediocre at best. It was not tender, and they definitely skimp out on the meat. I barely tasted the cheese in my order. Onions are onions so it's a bit hard to mess that up. Overall, I wouldn't recommend going to Geno's for your first Philly cheesesteak experience. I give it two stars: one for the food and one for the quick service. Save yourself the trouble and head to Tony Luke's! I have yet to try Jim's, but that's next on my list."
6445,9,2,1,8/30/2014,"So decided to stop in and try a cheese steak at ginos steaks, what a disappointment figured coming from NYC it would be better than anything I could find back home. NOT!! First off the meat is sliced not chopped, had no flavor, the bread was weak and really didn't stand up to the steak, not even toasted, the onions , tasted like they came outa a can , the cheese ( got provolone ) again no flavor and not even melted, Oh and where are the peppers man, cant have a cheese steak without peppers! All in all very poor , I can get a better tasting cheese steak from papaya king on the corner of 42nd and 9th for $7.50 with fries and a drink. And to be fair I went across the street to try Pats king of steaks same crap! Final word can get a better cheese stake for half the price in NYC"
6446,9,1,1,8/30/2014,"These people think its funny to have horrible attitudes. ˜Not the Philadelphia spirit. ˜Funny that they demand you speak English, since they are all decendants of a bunch of immigrant Italians running the place. ˜Their cheese steaks belong in Times Square, not South Philly. ˜We got yelled at because we parked (on the public street) and then went to Pats across the street. ˜These people are not what Philadelphia is about. ˜This is also the same place where fans think its funny to beat up visiting sports team fans. ˜I just want a steak, I'm not here to earn street cred!"
6447,9,2,1,8/28/2014,"Ehhhh nothing compared to Pats. ˜When you look at theirs next to pats, it's got wayyyy less meat and their wiz is more liquidy. I wouldn't come back to this one when I'm in Philly and craving a cheesesteak since Pats just right across the street lol"
6448,9,1,1,8/25/2014,"Was in Philly a couple of weekends ago with a friend and we figured we'd do the tourist thing and go try Pat's and Geno's. First ate at Pat's then came here to compare. Fortunately, right before i was about to place my order my friend pointed out their bullshit ""taking back our country! this is America speak English"" sign. ....Are you serious? So we turned around and went back to Pat's for seconds instead. And judging from the reviews not only are they blatantly racist, but their food sucks anyway, so I'm content with our choice. Stay classy, Geno's."
6449,9,1,1,8/25/2014,Go for pat's! but i think they're both over-rated to be honest...
6450,9,1,1,8/25/2014,"Soooo ... I tried a bite of a friends cheesesteak late night after bar hopping and I spit it right out ! I felt like I was eating very low quality meat that was chewy and made think that if I ever had rat meat that's what it would taste and feel like ! I do love a good cheese fry late night from here , but don't forget ˜in the morning you will be ass blasting it out !! Haha at least that's what always happens to me !"
6451,9,1,1,8/25/2014,Very bland. I don't understand how they can call themselves the best. Tasteless and cheeseless overpriced cheese steak sandwich. I barely tasted the cheese and the steak had no taste. ˜Oh and there was a sign at the ordering counter telling customers to speak English. I mean I understand that but customers are the ones who pay your rent and salary so have some respect man.
6452,9,4,1,8/24/2014,"Love cheesesteaks here!!!!! I like how they cut their meat thin slice and easy to chew, it was tender and love onions was cook on the point. The only thing is their service wasn't friendly!!!!"
6453,9,3,1,8/24/2014,"Fat Peter rating system. as follows: STARS- standard yelp CHANCE I WILL BE BACK- NO Why I went ˜-famous. why not they a little better then pats they don't chop their steak. ˜standard cheesesteak i've had better Foods done.... lets move on GENO STEAK is a sonofabitch. ˜he is a racist with his political rants and bull ""speak english"" ˜he runs a public place and he should take that stuff down. ˜I will never eat there again. racist KKK bastard. ˜FREEDOM Fries ... WHITE piece of pasta eating big mouth trash. ˜ don't you dare take this down cause he has the signs up at restaurant I can put this up. ˜ oh and cheesesteak was okay goto other place I reviewed.. have a nice day"
6454,9,3,1,8/24/2014,"Oh Geno's ˜I really liked how fast I got my food, but I have to say where's the beef? I came here with our of town guest we shared a Geno's and a Pats cheese steak.... and the winner was Pats. While I have to say the glimmering light of Geno's is tempting I would most definitely go to Pat's. Not to say they don't make a tasty Cheese Steak, I will definitely give it another try."
6455,9,4,1,8/24/2014,"If you choose anywhere else for a Philly cheese steak, you're not from Philly...it's just the way it is. Order correctly and ENJOY!"
6456,9,3,1,8/23/2014,Definitely not what I expected. ˜The quality of the roast beef wasn't there. ˜The mushrooms were canned and they charged $1 extra. The grilled onions were nothing special. There is no special sauce either. I put some mustard on it just to get some flavor. The bread was very good. ˜The line wasn't too bad. ˜They made all the pricing end in even dollars with tax. ˜$4 for french fries that looked ordinary is no bargain. I skipped them. ˜$2 for small drinks and no refills - no bargain. ˜They are using their hype to get business. ˜Pain that you have to go to different windows for sandwiches and drinks/fries.
6457,9,2,1,8/23/2014,I can get a better cheesesteak at my local pizzeria in NYC. Really nothing special. Frozen fries get rubbery after 5 minutes. I really cant believe I drove down here for this. Maybe Pat's??
6458,9,4,1,8/21/2014,"So i got dragged along on a road trip and was told this was one of the better cheesesteak spots in Philly. Not gonna lie I am not a huge fan of teh ""chease steaK' but I figured why not try it... So we get there and tehres a huge line, mind you this was on July 4th, of all days, but the line went pretty quick, It's definetly a assembly line prep of the classic cheese steak sandwich. I love that I can see the kitchen prepare my food right before my eyes. The sandwiches were flying like hot cakes and everyone was raving about them. While on the line a patron of the competetion, ""pat's steaks"" decided that he was going to buy a steak from geno's and Pat's, (comparison?) and sit at the tables meant for geno's... A big guy, Presummembly Geno? Started screaming at the guy to ""get lost with that Crap sandwich!"" and told him he didn't care if he bought one from him as well... He kept screaming till the guy and his family left. So taht was enetertaining, as I waited on the long line, while drooling ancd starving... So finally I get ready to order and get the classic cheesesteak with provolone and onions. My bf got one with cheese wiz ( yes ugh, cheese wiz). and we both got fries and a drink. The steaks were MASSIVE and worth the $9 they cost. I tried my bf's first and teh meat was good, and suprisingly so was the cheese wiz.. But I felt it was missing something. Peppers and onions perhaps? Eh.. So i took a bite of mine and boy what a difference provolne and onions make. It was heavenly... I ate the whole thing in a few bites and was literally tempted to buy another (didn't)... This was my first time eating a philly cheese steak in Philly, and I hear that there's A LOT of competetion, but I think Geno has got something right here. If I am ever back in Philly I will def. stop to grab one of these much sought after sub's.... One complaint: offer peppers on the menu, Thanks!"
6459,9,1,1,8/21/2014,"Haven't been to this establishment since a year. I only order the cheese fries because they are really good usually. Just had the cheese fries today and it was disgusting. I ended up throwing half way. Fries were not even crispy and they were soggy. Girlfriend said it has a powdery taste to it. Last time I'm coming here for anything. So sad, I used to be a big fan of their cheese fries."
6460,9,1,1,8/20/2014,"OK, So I'm a born & raised Philly girl. I bleed green just like any other die hard Philadelphian. I have heard ˜the ole ""What's the best cheesesteak in Philly"" debate many a time. I have been called every name in the book when I throw my opinion in the ring. To your average Philadelphia, I am a blasphemer, but as a true Philly girl, I gotsta keep it real. I'm just not into the famed Geno's. There are plenty of other authentic establishments that will hook you up with a much better sandwich."
6461,9,1,1,8/20/2014,"There is something wrong with you if you like or go here. You're either a tourist or have questionable character. Pat's is across the street just go there or any of the 100 steak places including food carts that are significantly better. Don't be fooled by the bright lights or the BS publicity it gets on the nation stage, its plain gross."
6462,9,1,1,8/19/2014,"Nope. No comparison to pats, and some rude ass service to boot. Go across the street."
6463,9,5,1,8/19/2014,"I don't get why there are so many negative reviews for Genos. ˜I loved Genos! ˜ I was in town and on the hunt to find the best cheesesteaks and out of the 4 I tried, Genos was my favorite! ˜And I even ate my Genos after it was sitting around in my fridge for a few hours so it wasn't even fresh! ˜ Genos - so juicy, tasty and oozing with cheese. ˜All of the flavors were there and it was so so so so so good. ˜When I reheated it, I was expecting it to be bad, but the flavors were all there. ˜I could just imagine how good it would have been if I ate it fresh. ˜The sandwich was also a perfect size! I tried Pats, Ishkabibble's and Jim's the same weekend and my leftover/sitting in the fridge for a few hours Geno's sandwich was actually the best out of the 4 believe it or not. ˜Pats was my second favorite since it was also very juicy and tasty. ˜I ate that fresh and made the choice to save Geno's for later. ˜Jim's was good, but it was tiny in size compared to the 4. ˜Jim's was also lacking the flavor Genos and Pats had. ˜Ishkabibble was the worst of the 4 since it lacked flavor =( ˜ I will definitely be back to try Genos fresh and we'll see if my mind changes!"
6464,9,1,1,8/17/2014,"Geno's is overrated. ˜It's mediocre cheesesteak, ˜I've had better at a local bodega. Don't go here with high expectations."
6465,9,2,1,8/16/2014,"I've had Pats many times, late night or for a morning brunch. I had Geno's only once when a friend bought us a few steaks for dinner. It tasted good, but I got the WORST food poisoning of my life that night. It was the only thing I ate aside from single miller light, so I have to assume it was the steak. I was sick for the next 18 hours and couldn't leave the house, let alone the bathroom. ˜Sticking with Pats in the future."
6466,9,2,1,8/14/2014,"Ehhhhh the cheesesteak is forgettable, definitely tourist trappy. I didn't try Pat's so I can't compare but I probably won't go back to try them either. Also not a huge fan of the over the top ~patriotism~ theme going on here but to each his own."
6467,9,2,1,8/14/2014,"Geno's is definitely an interesting place, but it's a tourist attraction and not a place to eat a cheesesteak. If you want an actual cheesesteak find a pizza place. The cheese fries are good, but not really worth the price."
6468,9,2,1,8/14/2014,The definition of a bad cheesesteak for the locals. The only reason I give them two stars is because the ordinary tourist wouldn't know any better. This place is just an attraction. Pretty much as bad as it gets.
6469,9,2,1,8/13/2014,"So after living in NJ my whole life, I finally made the trip to Geno's. This place does not live up to the hype at all. The food was not cooked fresh. We ordered and were given our food like 30 seconds later. So basically they have food just hanging out waiting to be placed on a roll. That does not sound appetizing at all. ˜The sandwich was not horrible, but not good. There was like 2 pieces of meat on the roll, and mostly uncooked onions. Oh and I wasn't aware, but they don't cut the steak like a typical cheese steak. It's more or less like a slab of meat. ˜The roll itself was ok. Most of the staff appeared to be annoyed. Maybe they are tired of working for a tourist attraction. Who knows. I will probably never go back here. Oh and I almost forgot, the minute we went to sit down, some older guy who claims that he worked there was trying to bum cigarettes from people. -__-"
6470,9,3,1,8/13/2014,"Most of the time, when I purchase a steak, it didn't come from live cook, came from the cooked pot. Pat's Steaks do that, fresh cooked. I would go for Pat's steak."
6471,9,2,1,8/12/2014,"What a greasy, sad disappointment. I was deciding if I wanted Pat's or Geno's (at the time I hadn't tried either). I chose to go with the shorter line, which was obviously the wrong choice because I landed at in a uncomfortable, greasy neon afterglow of a terrible sandwich. I'm giving this 2 stars because I think even a crummy cheesesteak is still a 2 star cheesesteak.. because cheesesteaks are awesome. Wait in line and go to Pat's, or, even better, skip this nonsense all together."
6472,9,2,1,8/12/2014,"Tried it for the first time because of the hype. Really not what I expected after trying all the other cheesesteak places in Philly. Definitely a tourist attraction..usually the hole in the walls that don't have the lights, glitz and glamour are way better"
6473,9,4,1,8/11/2014,"The Philly cheesesteak showdown went down! Genos versus Pats. This is one area that you need to pass by if you're visiting Philly. It's located in a typical Philly neighborhood with surrounding brick houses, plenty of people, and a lot of activity at the playground. Back to the steak off. Their sandwiches are similar sizes and the meat portions seem to be about the same. Pats bread is a little tougher than Genos. But with Genos bread, you can actually taste the richness of the bread. Genos onions and the cheese is hands down the winner. Overall unanimous decision goes to Genos."
6474,9,3,1,8/11/2014,"I tried both Geno's and Pat's one right after the other. No I did not eat two full cheesesteaks within a matter of minutes, thankyouverymuch! :) I had a few bites of each one and I have to say, they aren't anything special and for the price, definitely not anything special but if I had to chose I like Geno's better!"
6475,9,3,1,8/10/2014,"It's about what I expected. Greasy meat and onions on a great piece of bread but it's part of the Philly experience. We got there right before a huge lunch rush which lasted the rest of the time we were there. I'd venture to say that a Whiz wit would be awesome at 2am on the way home from the bar though. I'll try Pat's next to compare, then I've gotta get a roast pork that people rave about. I love sandwiches!"
6476,9,5,1,8/9/2014,Every time I go to south philadelphia i make it a point to stop at both Pat's and to geno's. I love them both. there is little difference between the two.
6477,9,1,1,8/9/2014,"I'm not one to write bad review's, ˜never have before, ˜but I find this place to be absolutely ridiculous. I came here to see what all the hype was about, and came to the conclusion that it was NOT for the taste or quality of the food! Hundreds of celebrity photo's and autographs is all that makes these people come back, and it saddens me to see how skewed humanity's perception is when we can no longer even use our own judgement and personal taste to value the food we eat! Because 'celebrities' once dined at this spot, it's automatically supposed to make the food something delicious?! Ridiculous. Don't. Just don't waste your time and money."
6478,9,3,1,8/9/2014,"Geno's is the Las Vegas of South Philly - open 24/7 and bright as heck at night! This place draws completely different crowds, depending on the time of day. My fair assessment: Lunch = Tourists | Dinner = Locals | Overnight = The After-Partiers. Whenever you go, be prepared to stand in line and/or lose your place if you don't order in English. But, who doesn't love a splash of orange fake cheese on white bread with lots of grease-soaked meat!? (I sometimes do!) While ""Pat's and Geno's"" is the slogan that resonates throughout the City of Brotherly Love for good cheesesteaks, my favorite will always be Jim's on South."
6479,9,2,1,8/9/2014,"If I had to pick between Pat's and Geno's then I guess I would pick Geno's..though if it came down to it I would really pick neither! I prefer a cheesesteak hoagie from Barrel's on 18th and Wolf though I wish they should stop skimping on the meat! Anyway..back to Geno's...picture this..it's 2AM on a hot summer night after you have had a little too much to drink so you decide to do what every Philly native does pop over to Geno's! Well....at 2AM on this hot summer night in Philly the air was so thick with the smell of steak, onions and garbage....or at least it was when I was there. It was nauseating and it made me lose my appetite so I just got fries and a soda and called it a morning!"
6480,9,2,1,8/9/2014,try it just to say you had it i guess
6481,9,2,1,8/8/2014,I came here with my dad on Monday night and our cheesesteaks were not that great. The meat was dry and they didn't cook their onions long enough. They also skimped on the cheese whiz. The roll was phenomenal though. The people that work here are just odd and unfriendly. They are cash only so go prepared with some bills. I still like Jim's on South better!
6482,9,3,1,8/8/2014,"This place is better than Pat's. The line was long, even at 2 pm on a Friday. The one with cheese whiz was pretty good. The Four Seasons makes a better cheesesteak."
6483,9,4,1,8/7/2014,yummm..love their cheese steaks!! best in philly
6484,9,2,1,8/7/2014,not good
6485,9,5,1,8/6/2014,"Love these cheesesteaks!! I have been to Pat's (across the street) and also Jim's. Geno's is by far much tastier and juicier. I like how the meat is cut into thinner slices than most other Philly cheesesteaks. I also prefer Geno's bread than any of the other cheesesteaks. I see people complaining about the service, but you know what you are getting yourself into: an establishment that has been around since 1966, quick service, and a bang for your buck. For the price that the cheesesteaks cost, I don't think we need 5 star service. It's all about how delicious it is!"
6486,9,3,1,8/5/2014,i like it but not love it. the cheese steak had everything it needed to be good but i just didnt feel the love for it.
6487,9,2,1,8/5/2014,"I will actually copy and paste from my review of Pat's because Geno's is essentially Pat's if Guy Fieri took the helm. Geno's is really a tourist spot more than anything else. ˜It's not that there's anything especially wrong with being a tourist spot, but Geno's is not someplace to go for a special meal. ˜Most people want to compare it to Pat's, which is another tourist spot. ˜Comparatively, Pat's has better bread, the meat and cheese are the same, but Geno's fries are better. ˜They offer the basic steaks and fries. ˜ If you are visiting Philadelphia and you're in the Italian market, I say go for the experience. ˜You're not going to get a sandwich made with any heart or soul, but you can say you did it. ˜If you're not in the Italian Market area, it's not worth the drive. Please keep in mind, Geno's (and most of the italian Market) is Cash Only."
6488,9,1,1,8/4/2014,"Why is this place famous? ˜I don't understand. You wait in line forever and then you get a loaf of bread with a few low quality pieces of steak (they are strips, not chopped finer, which doesn't really matter to me.) But there's so much fat on the meat, it's like youre chewing forever. ˜Listen, I'm a grease girl but I couldn't even finish it. I live in philly, didnt really wanna go in the first place, but now we did it and we can return to local places with much better steaks."
6489,9,2,1,8/3/2014,"I'm only 31 years old. Why does this matter? Well, it matters because in my lifetime I can't remember Geno's (or even Pat's) being that good. I think many years ago, they were both kings but they have fallen due to their statuses as tourist symbols. Tourist traps is what they are. The steaks there are cold and are only fitting for the drunken and lost who have no closer alternative."
6490,9,3,1,8/3/2014,Geno's fries are the best! But I was disappointed with the cheesesteak. The perfect meal is a Pat's cheesesteak and Geno's fries :-)
6491,9,1,1,8/2/2014,"why does anybody go to this place? You can clearly find an easier way of ordering, fresher food, and a more polite staff else where. I didn't eat here (or pat's directly across the street) if i want a GOOD CHEESE STEAK...i will go to the many other place i have eaten (and review before) i'm not a tourist....i live for philly!"
6492,9,2,1,8/1/2014,Great location for a Boys II Men video. You are required to speak English when ordering which is a drag. Go to Jim's on South Street. John Goodman ate there once. That's all you need to know.
6493,9,1,1,8/1/2014,"Ugh... I'm so turned off by this place. I recently took my out of town family here to try a cheese steak for the first time. We wanted to try both Pat's and Geno's so we ordered one cheese steak that we all could share. I asked if they had any plastic knives that we could use to cut the sub up, they said that I had to bring the sub back up here and they would cut it for me. I asked if she could cut it in four pieces, she scoffed and said absolutely not and that she shouldn't be cutting it at all for me... wtf? I'm not sure what the hell that means. They weren't busy, so it's not like I was in their way. They also have all of this shitty propaganda up that says, ""we live in America, order in English"" and they call their fries, ""freedom fries"". Uhhh... it's been ten years since that cute little joke came on the scene... we're friends with the French again. I think they're rude and the cheese steak was just okay. Go to PAT'S!!"
6494,9,2,1,8/1/2014,"It was a long wait just to get a philly cheesesteak so maybe that's why I had such a high expectation, but to be honest it was not worth the wait or the hype. ˜The only thing that got me excited to be here was the hype, took some pictures after eating my food. ˜Unfortunately I hve to say that I had way better somewhere else, even the fries was just extremely salty and nothing more. ˜ I feel bad talking about it like this, but I really don't get it. ˜Hey if you do like it and enjoy their philly cheesesteak good, but for some reason it just didn't do it for me."
6495,9,4,1,7/30/2014,"Like everyone says...I have had better cheesesteaks but that not what going here is all about ..is it? ˜ ˜I ate at Genos prob about 20 years ago and talked it up big to my family. ˜Have to say, it wasn't near as good as I remembered...lol! ˜ BUT when in Philly... ˜ My husband got Pats across the street so we could do the comparison and both were equally as ""good"". ˜I think we may have preferred the fries at Pats over Genos. ˜ It's an American Icon tho..so you have to give it a try. ˜Before you go make sure of a few things: Bring cash ( they only take cash) Know what you want by the time you get through the line or get the heck outta there...ha. ˜ The line in the street moves fast because of the first two points."
6496,9,5,1,7/29/2014,"*Bring Cash** OMG! So we did the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge, and I chose Geno's! The bread is soooo much better! It's soft, buttery and lightly toasted. Plus, the cheese tastes better. I was in heaven! I will be going back in a few weeks & Geno's is definitely on my list!"
6497,9,5,1,7/28/2014,This is a must stop if your visiting and looking for a place to get a authentic cheese steak in Philly. ˜The food was better than Pat's which is across the street. ˜I was really hungry so I got a sandwich from both places! ˜I feel like I got the real Philly cheese steak experience! ˜There are plenty of famous celebs and politicians on the wall with Geno. ˜Apparently quite a few of them stop in for a cheese steak there. ˜Bring Cash.
6498,9,3,1,7/27/2014,Ok I have to say my favorite place is still Tony Luke's. But TL is different. Now if you want a good cheesesteak this is a good place to start. But if you get here during certain times of the the prepare to wait a bit.
6499,9,3,1,7/26/2014,"Not bad, not the best. (The best place for a cheesesteak is John's Roast Pork, btw.)"
6500,9,3,1,7/26/2014,It was good. ˜Just not 5 star good.
6501,9,3,1,7/26/2014,"Pats...eh, genos...meh go to Jim's on south st"
6502,9,5,1,7/26/2014,we ˜loved genos steaks...were going tomorrow.
6503,9,4,1,7/24/2014,"People are posting here about the rivalry between Genos and Pat's. Yelp isn't for that IMO. I like Genos. The steaks are delicious. Juicy and the cheese is actually melted. I prefer the wiz, so it makes the sandwich for me. The lines could be long. Worth it though. Last time I ended up here I had 4 cheese steaks back to back. It was at 3 in the morning. If you're planning to visit as a tourist beware. After hours, it gets sketchy. A lot of the local teens hang out and act up. Aside from that it's delicious and worth the traveling."
6504,9,2,1,7/23/2014,"The steak was ok, but the slightly cooked, under-seasoned onions really kill the joy. I've had vastly better cheesesteaks in South Jersey, but I'm sure Philly has lots of good ones, too. Also, I find the ""speak English"" bigotry at the window to be pretty annoying. It's just not friendly and is pretty offensive to the masses of non-English-speaking tourists who come here."
6505,9,2,1,7/23/2014,It's not often you can copy and paste a review verbatim from a different restaurant but what is said about Pat's also goes fro Geno's It's really hard to fuck up a cheesesteak since it's just chip steak with cheese on a bun. That's why it's a such a great food and a staple in Philly because it's easy to make and it tastes good. You don't need to be Jose Garces to pull it off. And everything tastes good at 3am. Now Pat's doesn't fuck up their cheesesteask but they are completely mediocre and if you like you're cheese melted it's not happening here. I'd say they are the McDonald's of cheesesteaks but McDonal's is fast and cheap with the dollar menu. So if you want a medicore cheesesteak from some dude who yells at you this is your spot. But I'd suggest getting your picture taken here and then heading to John's Roast Pork or Tony Luke's.
6506,9,4,1,7/22/2014,I have to say not passing judgment but from out of state and had to try both sandwiches from Genos and Pats .I enjoyed both places for grub .Maybe on my next return ill get scoop from locals.
6507,9,4,1,7/20/2014,"Went to pats for years loved em, but recently they use very little meat and it was dry at that. Needed my cheesesteak fix and went to genos. Didn't expect it to blow pats away but it did."
6508,9,4,1,7/20/2014,Went to Geno's and Pat's. Geno's got my vote. Juicy meat and better flavor. Pat's was drier and a bit less flavorful. Workers at Pat's were so rude I got really annoyed. Geno's employees were a lot nicer and patient being that I'm from out of town and don't know the lingo that well. Geno's all the way!
6509,9,2,1,7/20/2014,"Thumbs down. I only came here to see what the fuss is all about. The meat is too dry and has no flavor. Glad I finally got to experience Geno's, but wouldn't recommend it."
6510,9,4,1,7/20/2014,"A must stop if you are in Philly. The service at both Pat's and Geno's is pretty much ˜nonexistent.... But that's part of the Philly Charm! ˜Speak English of go home! ˜Order correctly or go to the end of the line! ˜ At this point there are already well over 2000 reviews but here is my take on the Pat""s vs. Geno's battle. ˜ Pat's fries are way better than Geno's, ˜but Geno's wins the Cheesesteak battle by a nose. ˜ Geno's just seem to be juicier. ˜ The real truth is that I have had better cheesesteaks at other locations, but you are a true foodie, you have got come to the hallow spot at least one in your life!"
6511,9,5,1,7/20/2014,"Hands down the greatest steak in Philadelphia, or the world for that matter. ˜The key is they don't cut up their meat, they keep the steak in strips and that, paired with the delicious amoroso rolls, makes it irresistible."
6512,9,2,1,7/17/2014,Brought my sister and niece to Philly for a traditional Cheesesteak. ˜We traveled to South Philly to get the real deal and was highly disappointed! ˜We have better Cheesesteak in the suburbs and will take Ray's over Geno's any day! What ever happened to diced steak and quality meat? You can't cover lousy wit whiz!
6513,9,1,1,7/17/2014,"Being a Philadelphia native, Pat's and Geno's was always considered a tourist ˜ destination, so I usually stay clear of it. However, my boyfriend is from the south (Virginia/North Carolina region) and lives in south Philly and wanted to try Geno's out (since he has tried out Pat's). It was probably the worse decision we've ever made, I had a roast pork sandwich, he had their cheesesteak and we shared a thing of cheese fries; the roast pork was bland, no flavor whatsoever (I prefer DiNic's better). My boyfriend's cheesesteak was nothing extraordinary, he thinks Pat's was better, and the fries were so salty that I think I was licking a brick of salt. All in all, I would just stick to my mom and pop stores where the cheesesteaks are cheap AND better."
6514,9,2,1,7/17/2014,"Growing up in NJ, I've been hearing about Geno's steaks for years! I finally had one yesterday and I have to say I was underwhelmed. The meat has ZERO flavor, they were skimpy on the cheese, their ketchup container was empty. For $9.50 I would expect a much better sandwich. I also didn't like how you had to go down to a different window to order & pay for your drinks and fries. Also very inconvenient that they only accept cash. I had to pay an almost $3 fee at the ATM. Glad I finally got to experience Geno's, but wouldn't recommend it and won't be a retraining customer."
6515,9,2,1,7/16/2014,"Not as good as Pat's. Bread was okay, but harder and did not soak up the juice. The meat wasn't as moist or flavorful either, which was disappointing. Would not go back...going across the street next time. The big lights and elaborate sign are trying to make up for the lack luster sandwich."
6516,9,4,1,7/15/2014,"Before I moved to PA, I had heard about the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's. And the first few times I visited Philly, I alternated between the two, trying to figure out which is better. I'm pretty sure I was leaning towards Geno's and then I realized why. They don't chop up the meat. I prefer whole slices of meat in my cheesesteak rather than the meat being all chopped up. I try to go to Geno's every time I'm in Philly. In fact last February, I came in on a late flight, wanted to grab something quick to eat before I drove home to the Lehigh Valley, so of course I detoured right to Geno's bright neon lights. It does get VERY busy, especially on weekends around midday. I try to hit it at an off hour. Otherwise you'll wait in a long line and probably not be able to find a table. Oh, here's a tip: know what you want and have your money ready (cash only) before you get to the window. And you want a Wiz Wit."
6517,9,3,1,7/13/2014,"READ THIS FIRST - RECOMMENDED FOR ANYONE TO TRY WHILE VISITING: After reading other reviews from locals and tourists alike, I figured I would add to the list. Just to be clear- I am up in Philly 2 times a month for business. I'm not a local and I find the whole ""Team Geno vs. Team Pat"" theater silly- so please stop. EXPERIENCE: I went with the steak and whiz. It was very busy on a Saturday afternoon so my first tip is I you are going be prepared to wait. It's a hot spot that has been touted as one of the best cheesesteak experiences in the city so people are going to come to see for themselves. The clerks and workers are somewhat rude- if they smell tourist on you and you ask questions about the menu or options, you are getting attitude. A gentleman in front of me was scolded- hurried, and embarrassed by the old woman working for asking the difference in cheese. Poor guy. FOOD : I am not going to say Pats is better or Tony Lukes is better etc, but in all honesty- it's a damn cheesesteak sandwich. Is it good? YES. Is it worth dying for? NO. Geno's was good don't get me wrong but personally I don't get the whole aura about it all. Overall, I recommend this place as a nice spot in town to get a steak and to knock it off your Philadelphia list. That's about it. Love Philly but can't get behind a place that diminishes a paying customer"
6518,9,3,1,7/13/2014,"Tried Geno's and Pats. I hate that they only take cash... So be prepared or you'll have to withdrawal $20 which is actually $23 after the ATM fee for a mediocre sandwich that cost $9.50. Everything about a cheesesteak counts and the only way Genos is better than Pats is they have better bread. Other than that, I'd rather have Steve's. They have GREAT Philly's. They take cards and they don't give you thin slices of meat. If you go at night there usually isn't much of wait."
6519,9,3,1,7/12/2014,"I chose Geno's over Pat King's simply because I saw on their banner that they ""Support the troops"". Not sure how exactly they do that but it's the thought that counts I suppose. ˜Anyways. I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and it came up to 9.50. I got a Pepsi on the side for an additional 2 dollars. It's important to note that they only take cash. The sandwhich itself was good. I had not eaten all day and walked around 4 miles so maybe that played a role in my hunger but nonetheless it was good. The problems with the meal were the lack of table space for patrons, and the lack of a bathroom or wet naps for your hands. We all know Philly cheesesteaks are supposed to be greasy so it would be a nice idea to have a way to clean your hands after eating."
6520,9,3,1,7/12/2014,Not bad if you live in the area but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.
6521,9,4,1,7/10/2014,"I am tourist from Florida. I admit this outright. I did the challenge on Monday July 7th at 3:00pm. I headed to Geno's and Boyfriend grabbed Pat's. He had only ever had pat's and I said this was unacceptable. He also didn't want to get whiz and I said we had to get whiz at both to have a comparison. He reluctantly agreed. Walking up to Geno's, it looked like a long line but that was because it was a bunch of people standing around the fries and soda line. Growing up in Orlando I have been annoyed more than once by a tourist, so I looked up the proper ordering technique and did my best to execute it properly. It seemed very appreciated because the guys were friendly. I had to ask if I was at the right window and they said I was and I rattled off ""one wit whiz"". They handed it to me, I said thank you.I already had my cash out. They said ""here, have a pen for a souvenir"". Victory! I suspect it was a reward for my effort. The soda and fry window was a cluster with tourists who didn't understand. I didn't waste my time on the fries, I was there to try the steak, but they did have birch beer on fountain which I happily got. We don't have birch beer on fountain in Tallahassee or anywhere I have been in Florida... Ok, the cheese steak sandwich: It was good and flavorful. It tasted like it was seasoned with Italian spices and I liked that it was shaved instead of chopped. Their onions weren't anything to write home about but they put a generous amount of whiz on. Their bread was outstanding. It had a great flavor that really added to the sandwich. It brought out the flavors of the beef and added its own dimension. It was what I hoped it would be. Prices are less at Geno's compared to pats. For sure on the soda which was 2 dollars at Geno's but 2.50 at Pats. I preferred Geno's to Pats in the Whiz category. See my Pat's review for the contrasts and the revelation that was provolone. **People have remarked in reviews that they didn't like the signage etc,. I didn't notice it but maybe that was because I wasn't standing in line. I didn't have any issues with service because I was kind and tried to do things properly. A lot of people on yelp seem to mark them down because the flow of their line or cash only or their signs about the right to refuse service. I say to those people ""when in Rome, do as the Romans do."""
6522,9,3,1,7/10/2014,"Geno's is the tourist cheesesteak capital of the world, but in my personal opinion the sandwiches tend to be hit-or-miss. It's a great spot for out of towners, and I enjoy going once in a while, but I tend to enjoy other local places more. They are open 24 hours, so they're sure to still get my business. Geno's does win on having birch beer and some of the best cheese fries! And, strangely, their coffee is really good! You may not think of them as a coffee spot, but it's perfect if I happen to be walking by in the morning."
6523,9,2,1,7/10/2014,"Though Geno's has far more autographed celebrity pictures on it's neon lighted walls, it does not make a good Philly cheesesteak. The meat comes in rather thick slices, is far drier...and overall, it's just not that tasty. They don't offer many cheesesteak options on their menu either - no mushrooms, no pepper. Thumbs down."
6524,9,1,1,7/9/2014,Waste of money. This cheesesteak looks like they put one slab of steakums on it. The roll is good but I'm not paying $10 to eat a roll. Seriously just walk across the street and have a real cheesesteak at pat's.
6525,9,2,1,7/9/2014,for tourists. jims is better
6526,9,4,1,7/9/2014,"Amazing cheesesteaks. Friendliest people serving you!!!! If you can get over the fact that they don't offer A1 or BBQ sauce, then you're all set."
6527,9,4,1,7/7/2014,"I really don't get the negative reviews I have never been disappointed upon my multiple trips, I find myself making excuses when I'm anywhere near Philly to come here (I'm from Maryland). The bread is perfect as is the Cheez wiz, peppers and onions are always cooked right, it's so simple it's perfect. As far as the speak English, this is America business, that is well within the owners rights, perks of owning your business is making your own rules, whether you agree with them or not. The same goes for the cash only thing, while it is a little outdated it saves the restaurant in service fees and saves them from the paperwork hassle of dealing with disrupted charges from drunk and stupid patrons claiming they ""forgot"" they ate there, it's a lot simpler and faster to operate cash only, it doesn't mean it's a ""mafia"" run establishment. That being said service could be a little friendlier, but this is a heavily trafficked order at the window sandwich stop not a sit down dining restaurant where you expect fine service. You get what you pay for which is an excellent sandwich, if you're looking for someone to kick your ass I suggest you visit one of the areas many chain restaurants and harass someone who lives off tips."
6528,9,2,1,7/7/2014,"The bread was chewy (not in a good way) the meat and onions tasted like McDonalds. They did have HOT SAUCE which was great. But, they were RUDE. Dude had gross teeth and had an attitude. Go to, rhymes with sat and starts with a ""P""."
6529,9,2,1,7/6/2014,"Forgettable to say the least. ˜ Start with the staff. ˜I don't find it cute or amusing that they are so damn rude and wear it like a badge of honor. ˜Customers pay the bills at this joint last time I checked, quit treating them like 2nd class citizens. ˜ Next, cash only. ˜It's 2014 and cash is dying off a little more every day, so it seems weird not to take cards at all. Next, value. ˜Generally when a place doesn't take cards, it's because they are making an effort to keep prices down by not having to pay merchant fees on credit cards and machines. But this place charges 9.50 for a sandwich, 2.00 for a tiny soda and 4.00 for fries, not exactly a value. Lastly, the food. ˜Simply bland. ˜The meat is scarce and lacks seasoning. ˜The cheese is scarce and not enough to moisten the meat. ˜The onions are bulky and not easy to eat. ˜ Overall, I have to say that all the hype surrounding this place is just that, hype. ˜It's not justified in the least and it's not worth your time. ˜Try elsewhere."
6530,9,3,1,7/6/2014,"It was alright, good if you're really hungry and Pat's has a long line"
6531,9,1,1,7/6/2014,although the atmosphere can be fun....gristle on a bun ! ˜tourist trap. ˜Have yet to find a philly native regular here.
6532,9,3,1,7/6/2014,I actually preferred Geno's over Pat's and this is after I had eaten two sandwiches from Pat's within the last hour. I found the quality of the bread better when we ordered and that's the only thing that made me want to get another. If you're visiting and you are debating on which to try I say split a sandwich with a friend and try both.
6533,9,2,1,7/5/2014,"Below average customer service. This place is wayyyyy too hyped up. Pats is better but height ones are impressive. Hell, both these places should give me back the gas money I wasted going over there."
6534,9,2,1,7/3/2014,"It's been a long time since I've been to Philly or had a cheesesteak so we did the challenge - Geno's vs Pat's, and we threw in Tony Luke's. There was a line but we got through it in under 10 minutes. Geno's was the loser by far. Not even a contest. The meat was tough and there was barely any wiz. Not a lot of flavor either compared to the Pat's and Tony's. The sign near the order window that says ""this is America, speak English"" really turned off my friend. It's 2014, please get with the times. Cash only. And if you want to order something other than cheesesteaks, there's another window, which is odd, but whatever. The people in front of me were taking a while to order instead of snap, snap, snap, but the guys in the window were ok and didn't get all crazy annoyed so that's a plus."
6535,9,2,1,7/1/2014,"I definitely did a Pat's vs Geno's challenge here and to be honest I was kind of disappointed with both. Pats is definitely far more low key than Geno's and to be honest I liked Pat's over Geno's although I find Jim's on south street to be my fav! Geno's is definitely a flashy joint. The signs and I mean having fries and calling them freedom fries kind of says it all. The service is super fast, know how to order, have your CASH (only!) up front and ready to go. As soon as you place your order is as soon as they will slap some cheese steaks down on the counter - it goes that quickly! THe cheesesteaks I found to be sloppily put together. Didn't think there was really enough meat cheese or flavor in it. All show no taste. A bit disappointing. However, I will say the staff here was a bit more friendly. ˜Oh and don't bother with the freedom fries they are bland and simple and not worth it. Oh yeah, order your drinks and sides down the counter at a different cashier. Weird, Yes. But it keeps the line moving."
6536,9,1,1,6/30/2014,"THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE I was at Atlantic City and took the train to Philadelphia. ˜After walking around the city, decided to go to Geno's since I see it everytime on TV (during commercial if a sporting event in Philadelphia, Food Network, etc). ˜So one would assume it would be good since it's on television. This honestly was the biggest waste of money and till this day, still hate myself for eating that dump. ˜First off, people that work there were rude as hell (I think it's just how Philadephians are). ˜I ordered a cheesesteak with light cheese whiz, fries, and a drink. ˜Believe it was around $14.50, which is also the biggest rip off on Earth. ˜I can get better food at a McDonalds' than this place. ˜The bread was hard as a rock, fries were awful, had no flavor even though I poured about half the salt in the shaker, and on top of that, they charge you for getting another fountain drink. ˜The meat was fatty, even fact, my gf was tearing off the fat that was on her sandwich. ˜It had no flavor whatsoever and SO BAD. ˜I actually had to force myself to eat cuz I felt bad for throwing it away. ˜ I wouldnt even recommend this dump to my worst enemy. ˜This is just a tourist trap and highly recommend NOT GOING HERE!!! ˜I seriously have no idea how some of these people have the courage to write a positive review for this place. ˜Im only giving a one star because I have to fill it out, if not, I would give a 0. ˜ If you are brave enough and still want to go, I seriously recommend you going to a restaurant in your local city and order a cheesesteak before. ˜Then go to Geno's....you'll see how bad it is. ˜TRUST ME!!!"
6537,9,2,1,6/30/2014,Mediocre...I hate to say it. ˜I tried out both Genos & Pats. ˜Both were ok. ˜The steak had no chewy fat which was great. ˜I found the meat to be too dry....also thought they could have used more cheese. I wouldn't come back again...but it was fun comparing the two legendary steak places.
6538,9,2,1,6/30/2014,"Meh is right. ˜Don't believe the hype. ˜These cheesesteaks are weak at best. ˜Although I've had worse, I've had better at many places, including some of the food carts around town."
6539,9,1,1,6/30/2014,"How do you say ""Two dogfood sandwiches on floppy Sarcone's knock-off rolls, please?"" in Telagu?"
6540,9,1,1,6/29/2014,Go to Pat instead. ˜More of a real Philadelphia feel than Geno's. ˜The proudly displayed sign of racism left a sour taste in my mouth.
6541,9,1,1,6/28/2014,"My family and I had decided to take on the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge. In my opinion, I liked the flavor of the steak and cheese better at Geno's than Pat's. However, the large sign saying ""this is America, order in English"" was the most ignorant thing I've ever seen in a large city such as Philadelphia. We live in America, a diverse beautiful country and we should not tolerate such distasteful humor."
6542,9,1,1,6/28/2014,"Not up to my expectations. WOW was i disappointed. I thought for sure this would be better than pats. After reading multiple reviews I was convinced that I always am a fan of touristy places and although I might not be getting the best philly cheesesteak saying I came here would be worth it. My husband and I split a cheesesteak from pats and one from genos. The cheesesteak from genos was so bad i didnt even finish it and order another one from pats. Absolutely no cheez wiz, it was so watered down and goey it didnt look like there was cheese on it. The steak was tough and thick. The juice from the sandwich just made the bread soggy and messy to eat. The people were more rude at this place as well. They yelled at customers if they were going across the street they cant park here, their car will be towed. So I guess they own the street too? Im glad i parked across the street and just bought my sandwich over to pats where no one said anything to us."
6543,9,1,1,6/26/2014,I came by here around 1 am on a Thursday. No one in line at Geno's vs a huge line at Pat's. the bread at Gino's was terrible and dry. The steak was not flavorful and tasted cheap. The service was very rude. I'm never going here again! Pat's is 10X better!
6544,9,2,1,6/26/2014,How is this place even still open (0_o)?
6545,9,5,1,6/26/2014,2nd Best Friggin steak in South Philly. ˜Eat it.
6546,9,2,1,6/26/2014,Can get more meat at other steakhouses in the city.
6547,9,4,1,6/22/2014,"Came here on the way back from Atlantic City in April. ˜ Did the Pat's vs. Geno's challenge and it wasn't even close. ˜I ate 1/2 a Geno's and TWO from Pat's (all in one sitting). I would say the roll from Geno's seemed a little chewier, i.e. maybe a bit better than Pat's. ˜The steak was not chopped though...strange...it was like slices...and definitely not as full or as juicy as the ones from Pat's. ˜Same price, just less bang for the buck. ˜The Geno's steak I had was plain (just meat/onions and white american cheese). ˜Still delicious, and better than anything south of the Mason Dixon, but not as good as Pat's. ˜If I could give it 3.5 stars I would.."
6548,9,4,1,6/22/2014,Steaks are better than pats. Fries are better at pats. Geno's has better soda. Both cash only. Both get packed but it's worth a try for sure. Get with onions and wiz.
6549,9,4,1,6/21/2014,"Had a couple of visits to Geno's last winter after Ray's Birthday Bar. Needed something in my stomach after all those pitchers of beer. Had a steak with provolone on my first visit, and steak with cheese wiz on the second. Loved the first, was iffy about the second. Plenty of meat on both accounts but not as memorable as Pat's. However, I'm happy to report that the steaks were not as cardboard dry as I feared. Worth going again if I'm in the area."
6550,9,2,1,6/19/2014,"Detroit native here - husband and I did the challenge between Geno's and Pats and, in my opinion, I liked the flavor better at Geno's. I thought the cheese was tastier and the onions sweeter. Overall it's a good sandwich. HOWEVER - the ""this is America, speak English"" propaganda EVERYWHERE is a huge turn-off for me. I don't live in Philly but I know it to be a melting pot, and it's pretty clear that with a name like GENO, you're probably from an immigrant family. It's clear that there are plenty of other places I should've tried instead."
6551,9,1,1,6/19/2014,"All cheesesteaks are essentially garbage. Take a good piece of meat, slice it paper thin, overcook it, cover it in greasy onions and cheese whiz. They are glorious, like some abomination you cook up at 3 in the morning in your own kitchen. So when I'm asked what the best cheesesteak in the city is, I say Pat's, and then add, ""It's only because it's NOT GENO'S and is open 24 hours a day -but only eat there if you just finished drinking in south philly and it's 2:30 in the morning, and your last cigarette is gone and things have gotten Truly Dark. Otherwise, go to Paesano's"" There's nothing technically wrong with the food at Geno's - but when you buy a 'steak at Geno's you are supporting their aggressive racism. In the middle of a heavily Vietnamese/Central/South American neighborhood, you have a neon citadel of junk food covered in signs saying, ""THIS IS AMERICA - PLEASE ORDER IN ENGLISH."" Geno's is a long term embarrassment, a testament to Philadelphia's long, mean race relations history, as well as the interminable, slightly less mean present and future. Support a Philadelphia where brotherly love isn't just for English speakers, and give yourself diarrhea at Pat's instead of Geno's."
6552,9,2,1,6/18/2014,Geno's Cheesesteak was on the top of my list of places to go eat in Philly. I ordered the provolone cheesesteak with onion and a side cheese fries. Fries and cheesesteaks are ordered at different counters. I guess I had high expectations for this place since everyone raves about it but I didnt enjoy my cheesesteak. It tasted like something I could order from a food truck in DC. There's limited outdoor seating but most diners eat relatively quickly so there's a quick turnaround
6553,9,3,1,6/18/2014,a-OK
6554,9,3,1,6/18/2014,"CHEESESTEAK WAR - Geno's vs Pat's I know nearly every food lover who wants to come to Philly has heard of Geno's Steaks and its rival across the street by the name of Pat's. I would also assume if you are a food lover, then you've seen the many challenges on the Food Network that pit them head to head against each other. Now, I might be making an even crazier assumption here, but if you are anything like me, you've been wanting to come to Philly just to do your own taste comparison. It's okay, you can admit it, you're in a safe zone here. No judgment. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE EXPERIENCE Geno's and Pat's are indeed literally across the street from one another, probably within 300 feet. I had no preference which I ate at first, but it happened that Pat's had an open parking space just outside their place, so we stopped there. Less than 10 minutes after splitting a steak with my two young boys, we were ordering our second steak here @ Geno's. The time was about 11:45am, so there were no crowds. If there is one thing I immediately notice it was how incredibly clean Geno's is, both inside and out. I'm talking immaculate. The exterior counters were spotless, the sidewalks and table were swept clean and inside the kitchen was like stepping into an operation room in a hospital. It was so clean that it looked almost new. This was a huge unexpected bonus for a germaphobe like me. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ THE CHEESE-STEAK COMPARISON Let me just say as plainly as I can that you probably will not be disappointed with either of these steaks. I spent hours reading through local blogs (not yelp) trying to decide who has the best cheese-steaks in the city. After all, I may not be back this way in a very long time and wanted the best experience. Pat's consistently made multiple top 10 lists while Geno's did not. I almost decided to try two other places instead, but stuck to my guns and fulfill a long standing food goal. I'm not a fan of cheese whiz, which is an understatement. I hate the stuff and wanted to go for provolone instead. But I didn't. I wanted a real Philly experience, so ˜I chose the whiz and the whiz won me over. I can't explain why it tastes so different and so much better on an authentic Philadelphia cheesesteak, but it does. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the flavor was and I am now a converted believer. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ FINAL THOUGHTS These two cheese-steak Titans are worthy of a visit despite what you might read in other comparative articles on the internet. Locals may feel there are other places around town that are better, but I can say for certain I was happy with my first authentic experience being at these two long standing locations. Both have been in continuous operation since the 1930's. As an out-of-town tourist, I have to give the edge to Pat's. They seem to dice the meat more finely whereas Geno's gives you larger slices. I think that slight difference makes ALL the difference. I also liked the fries much much better @ Pat's but the bread was more to my liking @ Geno's. Decide for yourself, but my personal taste preference leans heavily towards Pat's. youtube.com/watch?v=i78B?"
6555,9,1,1,6/17/2014,"They're racist. End of review. Oh, and their look sucks."
6556,9,3,1,6/15/2014,"Always eaten at Pats across the street. ˜Figured I'd give Genos a shot. ˜Nice steak but I've had many better. ˜ They feature ""Freedom Fries"" too. ˜South Philly after all."
6557,9,1,1,6/14/2014,"If I wanted an armpit wit cheese, I would ask for it. But you can't. You have to order in a ""special"" ;-) language, or else! Heavs forbid someone taint their holy earholes with a friendly ""Hola, neccessito mucho queso adicional, para mi pinga!"""
6558,9,3,1,6/13/2014,"This place is definitely hailed as a can't-miss Philly institution, and I could clearly see that from the line this place had. The cheesesteak was good, but I thought it could be a bit cheesier. The bread was soft (good), there was lots of grease (not so good), the onions were flavorful (good). The service was a bit brusque. Just a tip: the outside is decorated with pictures of the original owner posing with Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, signs that instruct people to order in English, and proclaiming that their fries are ""freedom fries."" Also a sign that lamented the amount of immigrants in America. I looked over that because I'm here for the food, not the politics. But just a comment, so no one is caught off guard for any odd reason."
6559,9,1,1,6/11/2014,"My feeling about Geno's is almost as low as mine for Pat's, the other, equally as dumpy place across the street. As mentioned about Pat's I'd give it a 0 if I could, or even suggest that Geno's give me a star for taking the effort to write about the sloppy low grade sandwiches they make. Very low quality with a very high price. Not sure why anyone makes a trip here. Lots of great and quality sandwiches in Phila. Geno's is not on this list."
6560,9,4,1,6/11/2014,"Come on people. It's fun. The food is alright ˜ But most importantly it's fun and a must so Philly experience. Dirty and over priced, but worth it. ˜Eat one at Pats too, do both in 25 min, it's a guy challenge"
6561,9,1,1,6/11/2014,"Why would anyone ever want to go here? Don't waste the precious time you have left, fellow mortal."
6562,9,3,1,6/9/2014,"I got the Wiz Wit. Honestly, it is a decent cheesesteak at best. But you do NEED to go to say you've been there and to compare it to Pat's across the street. If I do go back I plan on trying the freedom fries but Pat's was way better."
6563,9,2,1,6/9/2014,Just ok. Tourist trap. Nothing to return for. ˜Had a better Cheesesteak elsewhere. Tried both Geno's and Pat's and both fell short on taste.
6564,9,1,1,6/7/2014,"I wish someone warned us that they were White Supremacists. Pretty horrible ""America so speak American"" signs"
6565,9,1,1,6/6/2014,"There is only one reason to go. It's between 2 and 6 am. You're drunk and just got out of a bar and had no luck. And you're close to the restaurant. Otherwise, stay away, you can do better."
6566,9,2,1,6/5/2014,"Pat's is better. That isn't saying much, either. ˜Go to Geno's for the history and because you have to try it just to say you were there. ˜But don't be fooled - this is a tourist trap, nothing more. ˜ Geno's makes their steaks with more of a sliced cut than Pat's chopped meat. ˜It really doesn't change the flavor one way or the other. ˜They offer a few different cheeses to top your steak with: wiz being the original go-to. A problem with Geno's is the price. ˜You pay ballpark prices for a mediocre sandwich. ˜Last time I was there it was $8.50. ˜That might not sound like a lot, but for what you get it's thievery. ˜ Geno's has the nice facade and it feels cleaner than Pat's, which is more dimly lit. ˜ I was a fan of the hot sauce they provide to top your steak with. ˜It's HOT. ˜Don't overdo it, but it's a nice (free) add-on to make it a bit different. One huge plus for them is the availability. ˜I don't have many late nights anymore, but when I did it was really nice to know that these places are open 24/7 (at least, I think it's 24/7 - they've never been closed when I went)."
6567,9,3,1,6/4/2014,I had cheesesteak from this place before. It's my first cheesesteak I ever had. I wasn't impressed by it. I think it's okay.
6568,9,2,1,6/3/2014,"Maybe it was because I haven't had a ""real"" Philly Cheesesteak before but I wasn't impressed. I thought it was okay and a bit different with the cheese whiz. I also had the fries and wasn't impressed with it either, plus for $4 it was expensive for something so bland."
6569,9,2,1,6/3/2014,Not worth all the hyped...over rated! No flavor on the meat (greasy and bland) not enough cheese and onions. Very disappointment!
6570,9,2,1,6/2/2014,Strictly for tourists...
6571,9,2,1,6/1/2014,"Last minute late night meal. They always seem to be in a hurry for something ergo the lack of people skills. Overly hype food ""tourist trap"" as most Philadelphians called it. Lack of food options and customization. $9.50 for a cheese steak with just cheese and onions. The roll is chewy and the cheese is sometimes salty and greasy making it drip as you eat."
6572,9,3,1,6/1/2014,"Took a spontaneous trip to Philly to do the authentic taste test. I fell into the tourist trap. Dammit. Being from New York, you go to time square you admire it, that's it. Same thing should be done to geno's ... stare at it. Got a provolone wit and felt pretty blah. Not an oz of love was put into it. Food needs love! The fries were a weird texture but ketchup fixes everything so it's okay. Don't fall into the tourist trap like I did, listen to the locals."
6573,9,2,1,5/30/2014,"Good hoagies, awfully racist attitude. This place doesn't deserve the attention it gets, it's definitely not the ""best"" Philly Steak I've had... which is why I'm giving it two stars."
6574,9,3,1,5/30/2014,"was there ysterday. great people, decent steak to bring people from out of town but i have had better. might be a chopped vs layerd thing. bread was good but a little hard for my taste. ˜fries were great and i love the birch beer. deff better than tony lukes"
6575,9,4,1,5/29/2014,"Stopped by Geno's over the weekend to check it out, not really expecting much because I suspected it's probably a tourist trap, but I was kind of hungry and in the area. So I ordered a steak with onion and provolone for the overpriced $9. Started into it and wasn't blown away, but I soon discovered I just couldn't stop eating until it was gone. Was it a gourmet sandwich? Was it a culinary masterpiece crafted by a genius chef? Was it sprinkled with crack? ..... No. But it was just so damn tasty that I don't think I picked my head up to look around once. That and an ice cold beer? Happy as a bastard!"
6576,9,1,1,5/28/2014,"This place sucks and so does Pat's. It's a shame that some people choose to have their first cheesesteak at one of these two places. They're really overpriced, their cheesesteak options are very limited, and they are pretty rude if you take more than 5 seconds to order. They literally move you along like an assembly line. There's a million other places to get a cheesesteak in Philly and 99% of them are better. Most places also give you more/ better quality meat and way more of a variety like chicken, different cheeses (not everybody likes cheese wiz and provolone), and endless toppings (onions, cheese, and a pepper is all you'll get at Geno's). And it's the same with their fries. In my opinion, the only difference between these two places is the bread. Worst of all, there's no inside. So finding a place to eat outside can be hit or miss. So try them if you must, but be prepared for major disappointment."
6577,9,1,1,5/27/2014,"This place is nothing more than a tourist trap. For starters it's overpriced, the cheesesteak is gonna cost you 9.50 and if you want fries and a drink that's an additional 7$. Next the cheesesteak itself is terrible, no matter which cheese I get all I can taste is the bread and the onions. The steak is comparable to a piece of plastic. Lastly this has nothing to do with the food itself but I really didn't like the speak english sign. Were supposed to accept and embrace everyone for who they are not be racist discriminating jerks towards people. If your looking to go for a real Philly cheesesteak try other places in the city such as Jim's or Tony Luke's that make better steaks than these tourist attraction sellouts. In summary, bad food, overpriced, discriminating jerks and a waste of time and money"
6578,9,1,1,5/27/2014,"I tried Geno's once. ˜I didn't like it. Stop asking me if I want to review things, yelp."
6579,9,3,1,5/27/2014,"Just got it up and running, have to wait to see how it goes."
6580,9,3,1,5/26/2014,This is really a tourist trap. It's okay if you've never had a cheesesteak before and just want the experience.
6581,9,4,1,5/26/2014,"ok, so for those visiting Philadelphia for the first time you must try a Philly Cheese steak sandwich!! there are two across from eachother.. this one and pat's. what me and my boyfriend did is that I got a sandwich from geno's and he got his at pat's and we both shared and compared the taste.. my review for Geno's: Get the sandwich with whiz cheese, it's soo good! the fries aren't so good.. just get fries at Pat's instead lol.. but I really loved their Sandwich here.. if u are going with someone, you both should do what me and my boyfriend did and try both! its worth it!!"
6582,9,4,1,5/26/2014,Pros: The bread was delicious and the sweet peppers were tasty. Cons: Not enough cheese!! The steak wasn't as plentiful as one would have hoped when they visit a renowned establishment such as Geno's. They only accept cash.
6583,9,3,1,5/25/2014,"It was good but lacking cheese, the bread was perfect, meat was tender, onions was good but the cheese was lacking, when it's called a cheese steak and lacks cheese there is a problem"
6584,9,1,1,5/25/2014,"I was so excited to try the famous Geno's Philly Cheese steak with American and onions. Huge disappointment. I had my order ready, as warned, and the lady was rude, flung my cheesesteak over to me and moved on. The steak ˜was not chopped, it was one hard piece. The cheese not melted enough. American cheese was my choice and the onions RAW! Bread? I had better at a supermarket. The fame got to them and their quality deteriorated. Patsy, which I went after to try was better but not great either. A street vendor called , mama's was better than both. The fame got to their heads and the sign Geno's has posted at the order window is rude. I won't mention it here. But don't bother in my opinion. Go to the street vendors in Philly. They work hard, and produce a better food product. Geno's fame, money and neon signs, which I think effects their brains, certainly changed their attitudes and quality."
6585,9,4,1,5/23/2014,Geno's Cheese Steaks are what they are a staple in South Philly and a Dam Great Cheese Steak! Now with that being said I need a cheese stake right now! Going to Geno's
6586,9,1,1,5/23/2014,"If you're the type of person who goes to New York to eat at the Hard Rock Cafe or Guy Fieri's newest restaurant, you're going to love this place (or its neighbor across the street). Otherwise, if you want a REAL Philly cheesesteak experience there are many better alternatives. It's too expensive, unsatisfying, and full of itself."
6587,9,4,1,5/23/2014,"I ordered from both Pat's and Geno's steak shops for dinner. Both the food and experience was good at both shops, but I liked Pat's better. Before ordering, it is a good idea to look over the menus for options, and remember to say yes to onions!"
6588,9,2,1,5/20/2014,"Disapointment. ˜Went to Philly to take care of business and and eat at this place. ˜Downer. ˜Bread, steak, onions and peppers were soggy, dry and not crisp. Service needs improvement as well."
6589,9,4,1,5/18/2014,"Geno's is not the original. Pat's, across the street is. However, Geno's is usually cleaner in the outside eating area. ˜Try both and compare for yourself."
6590,9,2,1,5/18/2014,Average steak and cheese.
6591,9,3,1,5/16/2014,"Geno's is good, I can deal with it. ˜Yes, it is touristy but it's also a certain kind of authentic Philly style that I can appreciate. They also have excellent cheese fries."
6592,9,3,1,5/15/2014,The cheesesteaks here are ok.
6593,9,3,1,5/12/2014,"I am a cheese snob and never eat American ""cheese"" let alone Whiz......however, there is one and only one exception. ˜I want my steak wit....and no other way. ˜ Nice bread and a good onion balance. ˜The steak is ok, but all in all a good steak. ˜ Always goes best with a birch beer. ˜ It's a piece of America that everyone needs to take a bit of....."
6594,9,1,1,5/8/2014,"Completely underwhelming. The steak was very dried out and also fatty. Without the cheese there was no flavor, just a rubbery and bland taste. The cheese whiz tasted just like cheese wiz and its only saving grace was it brought some resemblance of flavor to the sandwich. The provolone and American cheese wasn't any better. Together the cheese and steak left a feeling of dissatisfaction and perplexity at how this place remains so well known. ˜ The worst part though was how over priced it was. For a little under $10 there was very little steak ˜and a lot of bread. For an additional $7 you can get fries and a drink. The fries tasted good, especially with cheese. Overall however, for spending nearly $20 for the sandwich, fries and drink, your money can be spent much better else where."
6595,9,5,1,5/6/2014,"I traveled to Philly on the way back home from a weekend getaway in the poconos. ˜I figured what better opportunity that this to try the two rival cheesesteak spots?! I went here after being thoroughly dissapointed with the place across the street in hopes to be able to go back to NYC and not have to tell my friends that nyc makes phillies better.... they came through. Exactly what I was looking for. ˜Good bread, the right amount of grease, cheese wiz, peppers and onions... Yum."
6596,9,4,1,5/5/2014,"I went here once a couple years ago and got a steak with cheese whiz. It came as a few thick slices of steak on a white roll as opposed to finely minced meat. I actually prefer this. The steak was very flavorful and well cooked. They don't have an extensive menu. You come here to get a genuine Philly cheese steak (a.k.a. ""steak and cheese"" in most other regions). You can choose between a few cheeses (provolone, american, and whiz- I think). Add fried onions if you like. Not much else. Simple and good. And there's outdoor seating. parking is horrible though. I found a spot a couple blocks away around lunchtime midweek."
6597,9,5,1,5/5/2014,"This is the real deal, and was by far the best cheesesteak I've ever had! As long as you know what to expect, you can't help but give this place 5 stars."
6598,9,2,1,5/5/2014,"Geno's, like Pat's across the street, is a tourist trap open and luring the misguided 24/7. This is NOT where real Philadelphians go for cheesesteaks. These places are mass production at it's worst, with improperly (not chopped) cooked meat, dripping in grease and slopped with Cheez Whiz (no, we DO NOT eat that on our cheesesteaks in Philly). Average is a compliment. But even an average cheesesteak is better than the food in many places, hence 2 stars."
6599,9,1,1,5/5/2014,"i ended up ordering hot roast pork sandwich instead of a cheesesteak the pork is worthless very fatty, no flavor at all i dont think they season it right very bland but the fat really pissed me off tried asking for a replacement but they refused probably wont go back by the way my husband didnt like his cheesesteak either, says it was shit guess if your drunk at 3 in the morning this is the place to go its 24 hours"
6600,9,1,1,5/5/2014,I Don't understand what the heck is in the water when people think this is a great cheese steak.. I have had much better... Steve's Prince of Steak...
6601,9,4,1,5/4/2014,"Pat's cheese steak had all the cheese on top while geno 's is more distributed which I liked. Geno's gives a more consistent taste to the sandwich, not just a mouthful of meat. Service was quick although it may not be too accommodating. I wanted half the sandwich with cheese and the other without (wanted to share with someone lactose intolerant) and the guy at the window at first said they couldn't do it. Only when I asked again did he relent. Drinks are ordered at another window."
6602,9,1,1,5/3/2014,"Re-confirmed, 4/2/2014 - this is not only the worst cheesesteak in Philadelphia....this is the worst cheesesteak money can buy, anywhere (like, I'm willing to bet that a better sandwich could be found in Antarctica). If there is ANYTHING good about this place, it's that it keeps other cheesesteak places a little less busy. ˜As for the people who do choose to eat here, I just feel sorry for them."
6603,9,2,1,5/3/2014,"The service is fast paced and even though I knew what I wanted to order I felt rushed. Anyway the meat was too dried in my opinion and the bread was kinda chewy hard. I got the provolone cheese and that was not melted all the way, my idea of a cheesesteak is a sub with hot melty cheese with onions and mushroom. The bread should be warm and chewy too. This place is too hyped up, we waited in line for at least 40 mins. Next time i'm in the area, i'm going to try Pats and Tony Luke."
6604,9,3,1,5/2/2014,I understand the HUGE debate over the best cheese steak in Philly. ˜In my humble opinion Geno's is ok. Not the best but edible. I didn't like the fact that the sandwich was made up & rolled before I got there.
6605,9,3,1,5/2/2014,I had heard so much about Geno's but was very disappointed. Maybe it isn't that the cheesesteak wasn't good but maybe it's the fact that I don't like cheesesteaks - they're too bland for me!
6606,9,1,1,4/30/2014,Tourist place. Best steaks come from neighborhood places.
6607,9,4,1,4/29/2014,"We stopped in Philly on the way to DC last may. ˜We only came there for steaks, the lights, pictures and police patches tipped the scales in the favor of Geno's over Pat's. I got ""1 wit"" that comes smothered in cheese whiz, then I had grilled onions and no mushrooms. ˜Fries and a drink. One of the tastiest sandwiches I've ever tasted. ˜A couple guys went over to Pat's but I couldn't make the trip after the sandwich and fries. I'd go again but I wouldn't go out of my way to get there from Chicago."
6608,9,2,1,4/29/2014,"This is a tourist trap as far as I am concerned. Steak is tough and flavourless, bread is gummy. I would rather eat a sandwich that stayed together when I bit into it."
6609,9,1,1,4/29/2014,"The huge line stretching around the block looked promising when we arrived at Geno's. We had been told to know exactly what we wanted when we got to the window or they'd 'NEXT' us. After 20 minutes we arrived at the window and were actually a little shocked at the incredibly racist stickers stuck on the window. Getting past that we ordered our steaks, then at the next window ordered some fries. The fries were greasy and flavourless. The steak was on the dry side and it was all pretty bland. We couldn't understand what the big deal was. I think if you're in Philly and want to try a cheesesteak, give it a go but don't expect anything amazing."
6610,9,2,1,4/28/2014,"What a waste of time and money. I went to school in Philly and lived there for a few years but I'd never tried Geno's or Pat's steaks. To be honest, I had a feeling it was just a big tourist trap but my boyfriend was determined to try one or both on his first visit to Philly. Saying we weren't impressed would be an understatement. Service was fast, I'll give them that but everything else was just blah. The steaks were dry and full of fat. The rolls were nothing special either. In all honestly, the student center at my Alma mater serves better cheesesteaks. I don't know how this place has a such a great reputation but I was highly disappointed. I'd never go back again and if anyone asked I'd tell them to go to a little hole in the wall corner restaurant for a cheesesteak before this place. You'll get better food for a better price."
6611,9,4,1,4/28/2014,"As a tourist who went to both Geno's and Pat's both, I feel the need to compared the two. Geno's has great bread, good meat, and straight kraft cheese wiz. Pat's had good bread and meat, but crafted the cheese wiz. While Pat's seemed more like a home style sandwhich, Geno's was more flavorful and I just loved the bread. So, I will have to vote for Geno's. Pat's had a lot more options and which would probably be preferable to someone staying in the area. As a side note, the lines were really long and I almost wanted to turn around, but they were surprisingly fast. The seating is cramped so take your sandwich to the bar across the street, it's looks like a car repair shop.... 4 stars are given as I did not gave enough cheese steaks from the area to call them the best."
6612,9,3,1,4/27/2014,I went to Philadelphia yesterday and i decided to try Genos and Pats to see which one was better. Genos slightly edges out Pats. I ordered a Philly cheese steak with cheese whiz and onions.In addition i ordered a side order of fries and a cherry coke.My impression of Genos is that the cheese steaks are good however it wasnt anything special. There are places in New york that make better Philly cheese steaks.When i travel to Philly again i would like to try some other places that sell Philly cheese steaks. Genos is strictly for tourists! Special note: make sure you speak english when you order lol
6613,9,1,1,4/26/2014,No. I was born and raised in Philadelphia and avoid this place. You can get authentic cheesesteaks elsewhwere.
6614,9,2,1,4/26/2014,"Looks like my go-to steak place is sadly failing. ˜Both steak and bread were tough. ˜I think we'll be heading to Jim's and leave Geno's to the tourist trap industry in the future. ˜Better steak, better seating and better service!"
6615,9,1,1,4/22/2014,Tourist-trap nonsense wrapped up in a fake rivalry. ˜Don't bother.
6616,9,3,1,4/22/2014,it tasted like a glorified mcdonalds cheeseburger with higher quality meat
6617,9,1,1,4/20/2014,"Took out of town guests to the area for a genuine Philly cheese steak experience. ˜Never got past the signs in the windows of Geno's before eating at Pat's. ˜The ""This is America. ˜Order in English"" signs are still there. ˜Ick! ˜I understand the anti-immigrant bigotry behind the signs. ˜But this is Philadelphia, PA. ˜We should be better than Arizona. ˜I know that the beloved founder, Joey Vento, was famous for those signs. ˜I'm sure he was the son or grandson of Italian immigrants. ˜I asked the counter person if his ancestors stepped right off the boat in the U.S. already speaking the King's English. ˜She just shrugged. ˜I assume Vento would have approved of restaurants and stores refusing to serve his parents or grandparents before they learned English. ˜We should be encouraging foreign tourism in the U.S. We should be trying to make them feel welcome in Philadelphia. ˜This does not cast our country or city in a good light to tourists. ˜My wife and I are fortunate to travel throughout the world. ˜We bring phrase books. ˜But for the most part we rely on the kindness and undrstanding (and English) of natives of those foreign countries to help us order food. ˜Not so at Geno's. ˜It just makes you want to take a shower after seeing such a truly racist and ignorant sign. ˜There are many possible reasons that someone does not speak English. ˜It doesn't just mean that someone isn't trying to learn or is an ""illegal alien."" ˜How about a smile and at least trying to help instead of a nasty sign?"
6618,9,1,1,4/19/2014,"Geno's is a tourist attraction, not a true Philly cheesesteak joint. They are tossing meat on a roll and charging $9.50 to out of town folks looking for an ""experience"". The steaks are simply not good. Ride over to Tony Luke's for an authentic Philly cheesesteak. The place is less crowded and the food is so much better. The cheesesteaks are made to order, the rolls have a perfect crust. Just as I remembered when I lived here 20 years ago."
6619,9,4,1,4/19/2014,"Geno's and Pat's both have their fans and critics. ˜Although Geno's Yelp reviews aren't as great as Pat's reviews, I found the cheesesteak at Geno's to have a slight edge due to the more generous helping of Cheez Whiz. ˜Geno's sandwich also seemed to have more meat. Geno's restaurant clearly had friendlier and more personable service. ˜The building itself is also more colorful and eye-catching as it has photos and a whole wall of police patches. When it comes to which place has the better cheesesteak, judge for yourself. ˜Clearly everyone has their preference and favorite."
6620,9,1,1,4/19/2014,The cheesesteak was really gross. Undercooked onions and the meat tasted very bland. ˜This place operates more like a factory than a cheesesteak late night place. ˜ Nothing authentic about Genos steaks. Go to Jim's steaks.
6621,9,2,1,4/18/2014,"I don't consider myself a true philadelphian...i live in nj but work/play in Philadelphia all the time. I've had my fair share of cheesesteaks over the decades!! This place is just not good. Come to Genos for the experience not the food. In fact, buy one for two people... then go to another place to compare (across the street). But then again, they both taste the same anyway... The experience of Geno's is standing in line, talking to other people in line, wonder wit or witout!??! and then ordering. Then eating the sandwich outside while people watching people. depending on what time you go, night being probably more entertaining (or dangerous). Oh i forgot, can't forget about that ""selfie"" picture or picture of the food itself. Gotta let people know you hit up a philly hot spot. I will say, Geno's is a landmark for philadelphia. what that place has done to, oddly enough, ""enhance"" that part of south philadelphia is remarkable. Its brighter at night and draws crowds and helps develop the economy....but i digress..."
6622,9,1,1,4/18/2014,ass steaks
6623,9,3,1,4/17/2014,I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and onions and it was decent. They could put more meat on their sandwiches. I was left wanting more and that isn't a good thing after eating a cheesesteak in my opinion.
6624,9,2,1,4/17/2014,"Pats is better, We got both and tasted side by side. Could not eat the fries, they had a really nasty after taste and were under cooked. I will say that the staff here is friendlier."
6625,9,2,1,4/17/2014,Good cheese steak and a must do for a first time or a middle of the night cheese steak.
6626,9,2,1,4/16/2014,"Tried and true, this place has some friendly people. However, the cheese steak sandwich wasn't really the best. It's slightly (very) bland but the temperature and texture is just right. Worth the trip? Only if you're an enthusiast."
6627,9,1,1,4/16/2014,You've got to be kidding me.
6628,9,4,1,4/16/2014,"The battle of who has the best cheese steak question... I have to say it all depends on how you like your meat! ˜ Geno's has great quality steaks and never chopped up but sliced whole and laid onto the roll. ˜If you don't like big slices of meat, Geno's isn't the place for you. ˜ My tried and true is the American whit."
6629,9,1,1,4/15/2014,"so overrated, and never go after any philly sporting event because that place is full of drunks peeing in the street......there are so many places to get a better cheesesteak that won't give you diarrhea or heartburn"
6630,9,1,1,4/14/2014,PLACE IS FOR TOURIST !!! Rude miserable staff only reason I was even here n not someone else is I had softball across the street .... ˜Not even a good cheesesteak 6-7 pieces of meat if I'm lucky 7 slabs !! Ill give u a tip cut the roll even smaller try and hide ur 7 pieces of meat that way it will at least appear as a full sandwich ...
6631,9,1,1,4/13/2014,"Made the mistake of having my first philly cheesteak here. ˜Terrible, rude service. ˜And I felt like I was chewing through leather. ˜My brother ordered the cheesesteaks so I didn't notice the ""speak english"" sign until later. ˜I'm assuming it;s directed at the hispanic immigrants in the neighborhood? ˜How classy. ˜No thanks. ˜Never again."
6632,9,3,1,4/11/2014,"I reviewed Pat's before Geno's for only one reason: Pat's is better. Not that Geno's is bad but it tasted like the cheesesteak was average. The only part that I like is Geno's onions. It had more flavor than Pat's. The ""speak english"" sign was pretty funny though."
6633,9,4,1,4/11/2014,"I feel that Geno's or Pat's is a personal preference. ˜Geno's steaks to me has more flavor than Pat's steaks . ˜And for god's sake don't try to order anything other than Wiz wit / without, they don't do anything else no matter what you may have seen or heard. ˜It definitely is a bit touristy. ˜But if you're drunk at 2am and want a cheesesteak, Gino's is better than Pat's. ˜But there are much better places at normal hours."
6634,9,2,1,4/11/2014,"Ha. Two offensive things from my ordering process to my digestive process. 1. ""Speak English"" sign is plastered right in the front of their window. Standing near his sign lies a man who looks almost like an Italian Immigrant sticking up for a country that taxes the living crap out of him. And sir, if you are serving ""good"" food, you need to understand that real Good Food does NOT discriminate. 2. I don't know if it was just my batch, but the steak was dry and incredibly chewy. Other than that, the cheesesteak was not bad! I wish they had the option of mushrooms, or had more onions on the thing; but these are just personal preferences. Despite a long (but quick) moving line, I gave Geno's a chance. Disappointed with a distaste for the racial mentality and steak, I give my crown to Philly's Cheesesteak Wit Wiz to the boys across the way."
6635,9,2,1,4/11/2014,"Service was rude and arrogant, which comes with the territory, but I was hoping the cheese steak and fries would make up for it. Unfortunately I was disappointed."
6636,9,2,1,4/10/2014,"The day before I went to Philly, my brother, dad and I tried to decide which legendary cheesesteak shop to visit, Pat's or Geno's? My dad had recently been to Philadelphia and he said we should go to Geno's. We rolled along with his choice and after we watched the Flyers beat the Penguins we drove over to Geno's. So, the most important thing to remember is that there is a whole system to ordering your cheesesteak. I honestly forget how it worked but I bet you 100%, most of Geno's reviews will tell you how. Anyways, the actual cheesesteak itself, was... OK. It wasn't the worst cheesesteak ever. I got the ""provolone without"". That means one provolone cheesesteak without onions. The bread was chewy, and the steak was good. It was also a bit greasy. Also, the neighbourhood in which Geno's is located isn't exactly nice. As we were eating our steaks in the car, some random local guy walks up to every car on the street including ours and asks us to wash our windows! I've never seen that in my life. All the houses looked sort of run down and not so nice. My advice is... If you want to see the best part of Philadelphia, go to Center City. If you want to eat a good cheesesteak, don't go to Geno's."
6637,9,1,1,4/10/2014,"Horrible place, cheese whiz as an option should bring this down to a half star. Only popular because of tourist. Better steak shops in philly."
6638,9,4,1,4/10/2014,When in Philly you have to go to Geno's not only for the delicious cheese steak but also to say you have been to GENO's
6639,9,5,1,4/7/2014,"Much better than Pat's! The bread was tastier and you could feel the cheese and more juicy, not like Pat's where I was eating bread and meat. Geno's guy was all smiling and very friendly while taking the order. I really liked it. I recommend Geno's over Pat's hands down."
6640,9,5,1,4/6/2014,"I do not understand why this place doesn't have AT LEAST 4 stars average. We tried Max's Steaks first since it had a higher rating on YELP. They were good but lacked seasoning if you ask me. I rated them 3 stars. We headed to Geno's second and I must say...Geno's is MUCH more tasty!! I do have to say, Max's helping/serving size was much bigger, but I would choose Geno's ANYTIME over Max's! Geno's serves up a DELICIOUS cheesesteak!!!"
6641,9,3,1,4/5/2014,"Geno's was ok. ˜The best part of the cheesesteak unfortunately was the bread. ˜I used to live in Philly and it was pretty good back in the day (even though I used to like Pat's better). ˜But when I ate here 3 weeks ago, it became too touristy and the food quality went down - not enough meet or cheese. ˜Not sure if I'll go here again if I want to have a great cheesesteak but but I may return if I'm showing someone around philly."
6642,9,3,1,4/4/2014,"Geno's steaks are really good, love their roll and the ""whole steak"". Bright and clean outside and staff members do not intimidate. When we do make the trip we usually have one cheese steak there and one across the street. Love the hot pepper condiment station."
6643,9,1,1,4/4/2014,"Hey does anybody wants the absolute worst Dog shit steak sandwich of their life? Go to Gino's in Philly. Nothing beats a Nerf football consistency bread, with Tendons and grizzle throughout the entire sandwich. Tasteless unflavored meat by-product, with generic cellulose filled government cheese. What a god damn let down, I was going to throw this pile of shit sandwich back through the window but my Bro, and Mike wouldn't let me. Threw the crap out after 2 bites. You want a good cheese steak? go to anywhere but here. Pat's sucks too. Fuck both of them assholes for charging 10 bucks for garbage food that is inedible with 80% tendon/grizzle rubber meat. What a Scam, the're both inedible. I don't have the faintest idea who can give this place more than 1 star, It's absolutely the worst I have ever seen or tasted, Trust all the one star's they are no lying. The 5 star people must be paid to put reviews up. I could never imagine anything more worse than the scraps they serve. TERRIBLE! !! ! !! ˜!"
6644,9,1,1,4/4/2014,"Any true Philadelphian knows that if you want a good cheesesteak you DON""T go to Genos. The steaks are greasy, you're stomach will hate you within an hour of eating there and the people are rude. If you just HAVE to go to one of the two cliche cheesesteak places, go to Pats. The steaks and the people are better. BUT true Philadelphians know the best places to get a cheesesteak are the corner pizza/sandwich shops in the city. I'm a fan of the steaks from LaScala's and Brandywine Pizza on Spring Garden. And Tony Luke's in south philly is good. Outside the city...Dalessandro's Steaks in Roxborough is good. The best in the Montco suburbs are Lou's and Via Veneto's in Norristown. And Pudge's Steaks in Blue Bell."

6647,9,1,1,4/2/2014,"The wurst cheese steak sandwich I've ever had, Denny's makes a better cheese steak. The bread taste like its out of the microwave, very chewy. The meat had no flavor what so ever. Next time I will listen to the Yelp recommendation & not go there."
6648,9,2,1,4/2/2014,"This is a tough place to review because it is a classic but over the years they have just failed to keep me as a customer. My family has been going to Geno's since i can remember and as a rule I was a Geno's man rather than Pats. When i was first going and a cheesesteak only cost $7 i could totally love that. However as the prices have gone up, the lines have gotten longer, and in my opinion the service became more brusque i cannot say that i am any longer a fan. Perhaps when i was a child and still ate cheese whiz i could be a fan of this steak, but quite frankly there is better places in the city to grab a steak, and almost always, the service at those other places is better. Geno's is no longer worth the visit and the $9.50 price tag is just no longer something i am willing to pay for what i consider a steak that has not evolved with time."
6649,9,2,1,4/2/2014,"Tough steak & the best part of it was the bread. ˜I know it's a tourist joint but come on I was at least expecting decent food. ˜Not impressed. ˜Pat's was better. ˜Don't let the lights, glitz and glam fool you. ˜But I encourage you to play in the rivalry and do try both."
6650,9,2,1,3/31/2014,"Tourist trap! Nothing special about their food. Meat portion very low for the price, small portion of cheese, so so bread, sad excuse for grilled onions."
6651,9,1,1,3/31/2014,"I am not sure why people love the place, it's very mediocre. This would not make it on my top worse placed to eat if you understand what I mean."
6652,9,2,1,3/31/2014,"I've eaten here a handful of times, usually only when the line at Pat's is too long. It is okay, just isn't anything special compared to the truly great steak shops in Philly. Steves, Pats, and sometimes Jims are way better than Genos in my opinion. Thousands of neon bulbs make it a tourist trap, but the locals know better"
6653,9,3,1,3/29/2014,"Slightly better than Pat's -- the meat is a little juicier and more flavorful. Probably the tastiest cheesesteak I've ever had, actually, but not nearly enough product for the price. I know this may be deemed irrelevant, but the whole ""freedom fries"" thing IS part of the core customer experience because it's right there on the menu. Anyone who buys into this jingoistic bullshit needs to open up a history book and turn to the year 1776. For those who are still waging the Pat's vs. Geno's war...do yourself a favor and go to a place far outside the city, like Delco's Original or LaSpada's. You'll get nearly the same quality and twice the value, and in a world where budgets are shrinking, value matters."
6654,9,1,1,3/29/2014,"I've never eaten here and I never will because of their racist, xenophobic ""speak English"" sign, which the late Joey Vento admitted was directed at the Mexican immigrants who now live in the neighborhood. Wow. A ""neighborhood"" business insulting the diversity of the neighborhood? What a turn off. I hear their steaks are awful, too. Also, freedom fries. Really, why would you politicize cheesesteaks?! Aren't they something everyone can enjoy?"
6655,9,4,1,3/28/2014,"It all started something like this... Me: ""Hey man, what are you up to today? ˜Want to go ride?"" Buddy: ""Yeah... I'm hungry though want to grab something to eat?"" Me: ""Sure, what are you feeling?"" Buddy: ""Cheesesteaks."" Me: ""Well who has good Cheesesteaks?"" Buddy: ""Philly."" Me: ""Ok? ˜How does that help?"" Buddy"" ""We ride to Philly."" Granted, it was a nice day out -- but the forecast was terrible. ˜We looked at the map and saw it was about 120 miles to Philadelphia PA from Long Island... ˜We looked again at the forecast. ˜Again at the map. ˜ Again at the forecast. Buddy: ""Okay, the storm is due in around 7PM, it's 12:30 now. ˜Two and a half hours there, two and a half hours back, that's six hours. ˜We'll even have a half hour left over to eat."" I knew then and there that this was either going to be a great ride, or an epic failure -- but for now it was sunny and warm... screw it. why not?"" We rode through New York city and down the Jersey Turnpike -- the monotony of the highway and the growl of the motor causing a constant mental struggle between concentration and the visions of thinly sliced ribeye, warm bread, onions, and of course melted cheese. The clouds were rolling in as we arrived in the city and parked the bikes next to the landmark Philadelphia tradition known as Geno's Steaks, and walked to the counter. ˜Undaunted by the light rain that started to fall, we each polished off the sandwich we had been craving. The ordering here is ridiculously fast paced -- the service (while polite and kind) was more interested in efficiency than small-talk, and you can understand why as the line only grew as the clouds rolled in. The sandwich itself, topped with american, provolone, or ""whiz"" was served hot and fast -- the bread still warm, and the steak tender and juicy -- but not greasy. As the sky grew darker we knew it was time to depart, but before we did we packed another two sandwiches into the saddlebags... you know... in case we got hungry again. The only drawback to the trip was the ride home -- ultimately we beat the weather (though literally by seconds). ˜I learned quickly that the combination of empty stomach + copious amounts of hot beef and cheese + the constant vibration of ones abdomen on a bike did not make for the most comfortable trip. ˜(Why that hadn't occurred to me beforehand is a mystery) That having been said, when I do go back (and I will) I'll make a point of staying a little longer for the great steaks, the great people, and to enjoy all this city has to offer."
6656,9,4,1,3/26/2014,"Geno's vs Pat's is a fun American food rivalry everyone should weigh in on if you're a self-proclaimed foodie or a die hard cheese steak fan. What to expect: - Hoards of people in line, but don't worry, the line moves fast. - Know what you want. Read any signs telling you how to order before you get to the window. These guys are no-nonsense, but c'mon, it's Philly. - Cash only. - The first window is for cheese steak ordering only. Then you move to the other for fries, drinks. - If you're taste testing in spirit of the rivalry, order ""Whiz, wit"" (cheese steak with cheese whiz & onions) I ordered the whiz, wit. The roll was delicious and I loved the medium chopped size of the onions."
6657,9,5,1,3/26/2014,"Seriously, how does this place have only 2.5 stars? ˜They must have been trying to pay with a credit card, or got offended with the English only sign. This place and Pats are institutions. ˜The attitude and neighborhood is part of the full package. You have to come here and Pats. ˜Buy one in both places, they are slightly different but both awesome"
6658,9,4,1,3/26/2014,"More of a 3.5 stars, but I'll round up! When I finally visited this place couple years back, I wasn't not amazed by it but at the same time not disappointed. The name definitely hypes it up and that's the reason why I went. I say if you are craving cheesesteaks and never been to Geno's, go."
6659,9,1,1,3/25/2014,"Probably the worst cheesesteaks in Philly. Also the service here sucks, the people are so rude and unhelpful. I wouldn't eat here for free. ˜I wouldn't eat here if you paid me. Go to Tony Luke's Campo's, Ishkabibbles, Sonny's, or even PATS.. or any hole in the wall pizza place for better food and service than this crapfest."
6660,9,3,1,3/23/2014,A decent cheesesteak. ˜Better than Pat's. ˜But I've had better cheesesteaks.
6661,9,3,1,3/23/2014,"I take a lot of out of towners here for the search of the best Philly cheesesteak! This place is alright, good meat, the fries are good. One cheesesteak about $10. The best part though is they are open 24/7!!"
6662,9,4,1,3/22/2014,"Whiz, Wit! Two things you can believe: ˜Geno's is the original Philly Cheesesteak; You could eat off the floor in their kitchen! I love Geno's. I think it's difficult to say who is the BEST. There are as many great cheesesteaks in Philly as there is pizza in NYC. But Geno's really stands out (for me) because of its history. Nostalgia should mean something. And I've been going to Geno's for over 30 years. In all that time, they have never deviated from using great ingredients and keeping a crystal clean kitchen. If you're getting a cheesesteak for the first time, or you're drunk off your ass at 3:00am, Geno's is where I would tell you to go."
6663,9,2,1,3/22/2014,Didn't really see what the big deal was. I did like the cheese wiz though go during the day to avoid long lines
6664,9,5,1,3/22/2014,"Being from San Diego, having the chance to have an authentic Philly Cheesesteak is something I've always wanted to do. Well, that day finally came. Looking at the reviews my wife & I saw that Genos & Pats were right across from each other. Might as well kill two birds with one stone. We'd get a cheesesteak from each and split them in half. Seeing that Genos had an overall lower score, we tried here 1st. This cheesesteak tasted like nothing I've had before. We ordered the Whiz Without. (cheese whiz, no onions). The steak was cut in nice thin slices instead of chopped like most places I've had. Cheese whiz instead of your typical cheese. Nice toasted bun. It was amazing. Pros: Easy to find Price Taste Speedy service Cons: Cash only (ATM across the street) Parking No bathroom Outside seating You know it's good when the cons don't affect the actual products they are selling. Genos (is greater than sign) Pats"
6665,9,1,1,3/22/2014,"Absolute slop, always has been, always will be. Pat's and Geno's serve up some of the worst, toughest ""food"" in Philadelphia."
6666,9,3,1,3/21/2014,"Meh.. was highly thrilled about coming all the way out here to get ""a philly from philly"" but this sandwich left much to be desired. The bread was tough. . Meat was bland and it wasn't hot at all... lukewarm at best... :( it wasn't ""Bad"" but I expected better with all the hype."
6667,9,2,1,3/20/2014,"Having been here once in my life, right after I tried Pat's, it was an absolute disappointment. I live in NY, but everytime I pass by Philly I HAVE to get a cheesesteak. After trying both Pat's and Geno's it was obvious to me there was a clear cut winner AND it wasn't Geno's. Despite all the hype and fanfare, including the number of celebrities who have eaten here and the all-out bright decor, it came down to the cheesesteak. I ordered the ""Cheesesteak Wit"" and there were a number of reasons why it wasn't what I expected. First, the bread is not toasted well enough and a bit hard. It's pretty bland and none of the steak, cheese or juices really soak into it. This leads me to my 2nd criticism and that is the steak and cheese. There was a major lack of steak in my cheesesteak, c'mon! I felt I was ripped off a bit after spending $9.75 on one of these bad boys. How can they not at least fill up the bread with some meat, if they claim to be the best? You can't cheapen the experience for your customers when your competitor is right across the street. Third, besides a lack of steak, the steak was also bland and there just wasn't enough cheese on it. It was just a ""steak"" sandwich. As I said, I was really disappointed and if this is the way they have been operating for decades I really don't know how people think they have the ""best"" cheesesteak."
6668,9,2,1,3/18/2014,This place was a disappointment we took the train from NY to Philly just to eat here. And the bread was old and hard. The cheese not even melted. We ended up going to pats across the street and it was way Bette than Geno's.
6669,9,4,1,3/17/2014,Loved Geno's steaks! It was my first time in Philadelphia and it definitely looked more 'happening' than the place across the street! The lights are definitely a nice touch. Making the long line to order our steaks I really had no idea how to order it since I've never done that before - I listened to the other people and just went with it. You definitely have to be fast or the lady looks at you kinda rudely. Anyway- the steak was great!!!
6670,9,1,1,3/15/2014,"This place did not live up to the hype. The cheesesteak was too simple. It didn't have enough cheese to accompany the steak. ˜There was nothing special about it that made it worth the 30 minute wait. I would not go back due to the fact that they had a sign that said ""This is America, when ordering speak English"" and because the cheesesteaks sucked. Being of Hispanic decent and seeing the Hispanic community right next door to this establishment, I was disgusted to see this blatant bigotry. Two clear reasons why you should not go to Geno's and choose Pat's instead."
6671,9,1,1,3/14/2014,Family of 4. None of us liked it! The Philly cheese steak at Chase Field is better! Haha
6672,9,2,1,3/14/2014,just read my review of Pat's and just swap the name out. same thing.
6673,9,3,1,3/14/2014,"This place is OK. If you're not from Philly and you've never orderd a steak be prepared to be scrutinized. Wit means you want cheese wiz. American means you want American cheese. The lady who works there will give you the eye and make you feel like your'e from another planet if you don't do it correctly. I wonder if she stops to think that without tourist and out of towers, this place wouldn't be open. Even with all that, I've had much better cheesesteaks....outside of Philly. This place looks like it should be in Vegas it's lit up like a christmas tree. If you go in the winter, be prepated to freeze your buns off; it's outside seating only. Go next door to the Yogurt shop and get a coffee and eat your steak in warmth,"
6674,9,1,1,3/12/2014,"This is NOT where Philadelphians satisfy their cheesesteak cravings, and that is no secret. Its a weird kind of joke being played on visitors, the whole ""Cheez Whiz"" factor. It is NOT how a cheesesteak comes anywhere else but these gross little rat infested tourist attractions. Real cheesesteaks come with American, and they arent served by mean ˜spirited bullies, demanding a specific protocol when ordering. I wont advertise another establishment in this review , but if you are a tourist heading to Philly, ˜take this for advice: Be nice to your next server or bartender, give them a nice tip, and then ask where the LOCALS go. Tell em Mama didnt raise no fool, and your're not foolin for this Whiz business, and to point you in the direction of the ˜Roxboro neighborhood. They'll know what yer gettin at. Good, accurate directions will certainly depend on the manners of your above mentioned tip. ˜Happy trails. :)"
6675,9,2,1,3/11/2014,"Tried out Geno's Steaks on Wed 3/5/14 and nobody was there in the Winter so that's the only good thing. ˜We took the bus, I guess the tourist walk a ways or take a cab? ˜It's in a neighborhood far from the Historical District. We got a cheesesteak w/ Whiz & Peppers - B. paid an extra $1 for peppers, onions we got too. To me it was just ok, lots of meat chunky style, bread was ok, not enough Whiz for me. ˜Which they had more stuff in it like mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickle, more, more more. No public bathrooms that I could see."
6676,9,1,1,3/10/2014,Came all the way from Los Angeles to cross off my bucket list of eating a philly cheesesteak in philadelphia. I was actually in NY but decided to drive from NY to Philly to do this. The worst cheesesteak ive ever had! No taste at all. No seasoning. Just crappy carnival type of cheese steak. I also went to Pats too and they are better to go to but still pretty bad. No idea how this place is so famous. And it is CASH ONLY which is bullshit!
6677,9,3,1,3/9/2014,"The steaks here are different than at any other place, in a good way. They lost a star for being rude and for the prices being high."
6678,9,4,1,3/9/2014,"After getting out of a meeting. A buddy said genos was the best philly steak place there is in philly. we headed over to their dining facility, after standing in line for thirty minutes we finally was able to give are order. Biting into the steak was awesome and worth the wait."
6679,9,2,1,3/8/2014,"Just about edible. ˜I live in Philly and am born and raised ˜and I have had a better steak sandwich in a neighborhood place which doesn't claim to be ˜the ""best""."
6680,9,1,1,3/8/2014,"Worst cheesesteak I've ever had! Pat's is the same however so i can't say i favor one over the other. The disgusting steak that probably sat in grease for days was piled on top of a bun that was so extremly hard to chew and so tasteless. Plus the nasty wiz cheese on top. What did I pay $8 for?I couldn't even finish it. I threw it out because it was pointless to dil up on something that was so gross. I went down the street to south street and got a real cheese steak. I've had the best cheese steak of my life from a cart on 19th and walnut from a guy who doesn't have giant bright flashing signs all over the place. He is super friendly and always has the best quality products. He makes great sausages too. But my point is that, I have no idea what the big fuss is about Pat's and Genos. They both suck and i could care less what all those Philly die hard fans could think. Its the truth. Worst $8 I've ever spent."
6681,9,2,1,3/7/2014,"One time I saw Manchester United and F.C. Barcelona play at Lincoln Financial field with my friend Lawley and his Dad. ˜We were all drunk, and you could tell they were getting into their old roles of son and dad. ˜It was like a small dog on leash barking, filled with the confidence and ignorance that comes from being a small dog on a leash."
6682,9,2,1,3/7/2014,"I would say this is the lesser of the ""tourist"" steak attractions. ˜The rolls are good, soft and homebaked, but after that things are less enjoyable. ˜In my numerous experiences eating here, the steak is usually grizzly and tough. ˜I'm a whiz person myself, and even that can't mask the poor quality of the meat. The other major issue I have is that this place, for wanting to be the end-all be-all of the cheesesteak world, is not welcoming, in the least, to outsiders. ˜It's amazing their reputation has managed to keep them open, because their staff is rude and the ""Must Speak English"" signs are simply horrible in the global world we live in today."
6683,9,1,1,3/7/2014,"Going to Geno's is kind of like running up the Art Museum stairs, jumping up and down like Rocky and then getting your photo taken in front of the Rocky statue. ˜At the end of this excursion you feel dissatisfied and left wondering ""why the hell did I do that?"" ˜There's a reason the Rocky statue is hidden off to the side of the Art Museum. ˜It's just not that good. ˜Go inside the museum. ˜It's amazing! ˜Run the eight mile loop around Kelly/West River and finish at the top of the steps soaking in the view and feeling the burn of your quads. ˜Watch the actual Rocky movie to see what Philly used to look like and shed a tear when he wins but don't run up the steps like a tourist because that's what you think you're supposed to do. ˜There are so many other places to get amazing cheesesteaks. ˜Don't settle for a hyped up experience."
6684,9,1,1,3/7/2014,"Worst place ever!! Supper hard buns, 3 bland micro thin slices of ""steak"" save your $$$. The staff are like the ""soup nazi"" of cheese stakes. Let this be a lesson to me, and check the Yelp reviews. Others feel the same way I do. The building and sign is very cool, so our pictures did come out nice."
6685,9,2,1,3/5/2014,All I can say is- Old/ original does not equate to good eats! Skip this one...
6686,9,2,1,3/4/2014,"Cheesesteaks are ok. ˜ Cheese fries are awesome, ˜More about ""being there"" then about eating. ˜THe atmosphere, the pictures, the lights, the d?cor,. ˜It's all cool. ˜But this place is for tourists. ˜No real Philly person actually frequents this place."
6687,9,3,1,3/4/2014,"I stumble over here when Pats is too crowded, it satisfies the cheese steak craving when it is hard to stand up straight."
6688,9,5,1,3/4/2014,Geno's is much better than Pats. Meat has flavor and not chewy. The bread also makes a big difference! ˜Hands down Geno!!
6689,9,4,1,3/4/2014,Yummers!! 'Nuff said! ˜:)
6690,9,5,1,3/3/2014,Tried both Genos and Pats. ˜both are equally good.
6691,9,2,1,3/2/2014,The rolls and cheese fries are excellent. ˜The steaks are a different story. ˜My sandwich had more fat than meat.
6692,9,4,1,3/2/2014,"We wanted the Philly experience so we checked with Yelp and other sites to see what the locals thought was the best. ˜They said it was Johns Roast Pork so that's where we went. Johns is listed as #1 for Cheese steak in Philly even though their signature sandwich is a pork sandwich. All I can say about that is read my review on them and walk the other way. DO NOT BELIEVE IT. OH MY GOD IT WAS HORRIBLE. DO NOT GO THERE. GOD, WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! GROSSNESS. Anyway, we headed across town and since Genos and Pat Kings are literally 50 feet from each other we ordered a sandwich from each. IMPORTANT: CASH ONLY! At Pat Kings we ordered a steak, onion and sharp provolone sandwich. The service was Soup Nazi casual. We wanted fries, but were so intimidated by the guy that opened the window a whole 2 inches wide that we forgot to order them. The place is a little dull with fading pictures of celebrities that had been there over the years. It made us sad to see these iconic photos fading away. From Genos we ordered a steak, onion and ""whiz"". Their place is bright, shiny and flashy with lots of neon. ˜They also have pictures of famous visitors that are well taken care of and they have an impressive display of police patches from all over and a tribute to a local fallen police officer. Their service, while a little cold, was at least amusing. We heard someone ask if they had mustard and someone yelled ""For What?!!!"" I guess they don't think their sandwich needs condiments. They have the ""When ordering speak English"" signs and the freedom fries on the menu. Call it what you want, but we are in America, people, and if you speak another language its hard to get your order right, right? At Genos, it was a little inconvenient to order and pay for our sandwich at one window and then move two windows down to order and pay for our fries at another window. I dont know if the same applies for drinks. First, the fries from Genos were excellent; we loved them. The provolone sandwich from Pat Kings was a little bland and not too exciting. The ""whiz"" sandwich from Genos was better. My husband is, but I am not a ""whiz"" kind of person. I did find ˜the ""whiz"" at least brought out the flavor of the meat and was a better, less dull experience. The meat from both places was about the same. ˜I wish it were more of a grilled meat with some crusty edges instead of a kind of water saturated been sitting in a warmer, waiting for the crowds flavor. The bread used from both restaurants was excellent. It stands up to the juice and maintains its form. The onions......the onions on both sandwiches left a little to be desired. They both seemed to be lightly saut?ed chopped onions. If they had been grilled rings of onion and were just slightly caramelized they would have added so much flavor. ˜I get it about the tried and true recipes handed down from generations before, but come on, if its better, its better. Be a little more open-minded to improvement. Our opinion: Me: Meh, the cheese steak sandwich at Tubby's in Charlottesville, VA is so much better than anything we had in Philly, but if I had to choose, it'll have to be Genos steak, onion and whiz. Dave: Johns- waterlogged in the seediest part of South Philly, we gave one of our sandwiches to a homeless guy downtown. ˜Pat's sandwich was good, but Geno's was a lot better with the whiz."
6693,9,2,1,3/2/2014,Surprisingly lame. They grill then hold in a steam cabinet then regrill. ˜That's high school cafeteria shit.
6694,9,2,1,3/2/2014,It's an average cheesesteak at best (unless you're drunk) ˜since geno's got into the a advertising game the quality of the meat has gone down and the price had gone up. However geno's continues to keep its kitchen spotless which can't be said for the dump across the road. I really like the wiz fries but they aren't cheap and I've had better. Recently went to Phillips Steaks at 2234 west passyunk and it completely destroyed Geno's and Pat's Geno's and Pat's will continue this bs rivalry which could end real quick. ˜ Spend less on advertising and more on your product. ˜ As far as I'm concerned they are both sub par!
6695,9,2,1,3/1/2014,"Not my favorite food, but it's fun to take visitors"
6696,9,2,1,2/27/2014,"I gave Geno's ˜a try and have to say I was not impressed. First off the meat was very gristly on the palette, the bread was dry and tasteless with a load of cheese that I would say was like plaster going down. Look I know this is not fine dining but I was expecting more."
6697,9,5,1,2/26/2014,"If I wanted shoe-leather steak, casual racism and the threat of violence, I would just go to my grandmother's house. This place is mediocre, at best. The best cheesesteak in Philly is at the Subway restaurant at Spring Garden and Broad. This is the original. Get it with American cheese and extra mustard (NICK CANNON STYLE, BAYBAY). Tell the sandwich artist he is a ""buttlicker"" and cry in your Honda Civic for three hours. That's the type of authenticity that someone like old Geno could never understand. That being said, I steal all of my cheese whiz from here which is why I am giving it a five star rating. I must have 9 or 10 gallon jugs of the stuff in the back of the Civ' right now. I put it on everything: eggs, toast, more cheese whiz, a court order for arrest, filet mignon, cronuts, you name it. This is the reason to come to Geno's: petty theft and the worst sushi platter you have ever had in your life."
6698,9,1,1,2/24/2014,"Definitely all hype but can't understand why. ˜They are rude, rushed, can't be bothered to be asked any questions and the food sucks. Hard, huge, cheap rolls, very little meat, canned mushrooms and God help you if you mis-speak or don't want plastic liquid cheese! Oh and forget it if you want lettuce, tomato or mayo. Cheese fries were in a cup and drowned in the liquid cheese. No place to park or to sit inside. Yuck, never ever again. You could take a lesson in good food and manners from Sonny's, they got it going on!"
6699,9,3,1,2/24/2014,"Yeah, there's a rivalry with Pat's. Yeah, they have neon. Yeah, their bread is fresher. However, I think Geno's is average. With so many options in the city, Geno's is popular because that's where the tourists go. Try Chinks or Delassandros, much better experience. If you want the typical Philly cheese steak experience, go to Geno's. If you want a better steak, go somewhere else."
6700,9,1,1,2/24/2014,"I really don't understand how anyone can like their Philly Cheesesteak. I guess I will avoid all food recommendation from those reviewers . Now seriosly, this was the worst cheesesteak I ever tried. No flavor whatsoever. Even the fries were bad. Not to mention they charge way to much. And what's up with the system of ordering steak on one window and fries and soda on another. Doesn't make much sense. This is my first one star review... ˜And the reward goes to... ˜Geno's steaks! ˜Congrats!"
6701,9,1,1,2/22/2014,"I put a star so my review can go up. However, it is completely unacceptable and shameful that such a ""landmark"" with subpar sandwiches (by the way) is still popular despite what is a blatant hateful, offensive, racist, and xenophobia sign that says he wants ""his America back."" Ignorance gives me indigestion."
6702,9,1,1,2/22/2014,"Racist assholes. If it wasn't for tourist these bitches would be broke. I hope they get shutdown rude and obnoxious. I'm sure if these bitches were in NY shit won't be going like that with all these racist signs. Since were best known as the melting pot. I drove from Brooklyn for this shit hole I'm sure fucking eating cat food would of been better worst money I've ever spent. Fuck Gino's these fake Italians and fuck ya weak ass steak. I would've got better steak at ""Home Depot""."
6703,9,4,1,2/22/2014,"we bought one from here and one from Pats, this cheesesteak was far superior! I liked the bread the cheese and the meat better. The meat is cutuch better and more chese is used at Genos!! overall Yum on a Bun !"
6704,9,2,1,2/21/2014,"A huge disappointment. What an expensive sandwich for the lack of quality and amount of steak. Both of them are not worth more than $3 each. I hang my head in shame. 3000 miles for these two bad sandwiches, Pat's and Geno's."
6705,9,1,1,2/21/2014,can't stand the people always in the street and the racist attitude of the owners
6706,9,4,1,2/21/2014,"So, Pat's and Geno's have been going at it for a very long time to claim the crown of King of (Philly) Steaks. Even Food Network has done a special on this topic. To not spoil the fun, I won't disclose the outcome. So, diving right into this I can say that you have to ""understand"" Philly cheesesteak to ""get"" what Geno's is going for. The steaks are shaven, cooked with onions in large batches on a flat top surface. So they steep in their own juices and absorb the onion flavor. For those who have never had Philly cheesesteak, the prospect of topping off your sandwich with cheese wiz can be a sacrilege. Rest assured, this is how Joey Vento has made his sandwich for decades. This is the one time you may excuse yourself for indulging in pseudo-cheese. I guess the reason I'm a fan of this place is more because of its history and its unabashed patriotism. Prominently displayed on their windows is Vento proclaiming ""This is America, when ordering 'speak english'."" If you get turned off by his political stance, then I suppose you would have no reason to eat his sandwiches. In other words, don't expect a gourmet experience here. Instead, this is more of a spot for you to check in on Yelp just so that you can say ""Hey, I've been there."" Yes, it's pretty difficult to review a place that's popular not so much because of its food, but because of its history. Not sure why this place is called ""Geno's"" even though the founder's name is Joey Vento. Maybe Geno is short for his full name?"
6707,9,1,1,2/20/2014,They show this place on the food channel so everyone goes ape shizz. It's gross. Spend your money at Tony Luke's.
6708,9,1,1,2/18/2014,"Absolutely disgusting. I didn't even want to finish the cheesesteak. 'wit cheese' is all you need to say. wit = with onions, cheese = slices of cheese. 1. It smelled like pee somehow 2. It was bland. 3. Not much meat. It was just plain bad!"
6709,9,4,1,2/18/2014,"My first authentic Philly Cheesesteak experience was SO GOOD. We were freezing but so hungry, and we were a little shocked at first to find that the only seating that there was was the benches outside. Mind you, it was like 20 degrees and there were 2 women sitting on the bench eating like it was no big deal - I thought that was awesome. The guy at the second (fry) window was so helpful. I asked what we were supposed to do and he told me just how to order what I wanted so I didn't look like an idiot. He also directed us over to the bar across the street (The Garage) so that we could sit inside and eat our food. Each of our sandwiches were amazing. Perfect little strips of steak, cheese wiz (which I thought I was going to hate, but there's seriously no other way that you should order this sandwich), and onions. Bread was perfectly toasted and didn't get soggy right away - gotta eat it fast! I will likely try the rival place across the street (Pat's?) before I return, just for good measure. But as far as I know, if Geno's was the only PCS place to exist, I'd be in trouble if I lived in South Philly."
6710,9,2,1,2/18/2014,"It was edible, but wasn't out of this world great. The moz didn't even melt and the steak was a little tough. Did go between lunch and evening crowd, so possibly got the ""left overs."" The store front has bling bling, and very toursy feel -which is always good for one time visit. Will I go out of my way to return? Probably not..."
6711,9,1,1,2/18/2014,"racist idiots, terrible food."
6712,9,3,1,2/16/2014,"Genos or Pats?!? Read my review!! Everyone says when visiting Philly you have Togo to Pats and Genos we'll my husband and I couldn't decide so we picked up cheesesteaks from both and ate half of each side by side. We visited in February so we couldn't enjoy the outdoor seating which I'm sure is really cool in the warmer months. In this - Geni and Pats are dueling businesses - directly across from on another!!! Right off the bat Geno's seems more of a commercial spot, down to their packaging and branding which Geno's is definitely better than Pats. ˜But all in all-Genos was okay but not all we thought it was cracked up to be. ˜Genos steak isn't as seasoned as Pats and is kept in whole slices inside the bread. Pats is chopped up, season and saut?ed in the onions, bringing out a way better flavor. Genos bread is also softer and so it doesn't hold up as well. Genos gave more cheese and peppers and mushrooms which at first I appreciated. As soon as we opened them both up we were happier with Genos for that reason but it turns out that it didn't help Genos in our taste test. Genos wasn't bad, which is why I gave it 3 stars but in our opinion Pats was way better!"
6713,9,3,1,2/16/2014,Great steak bread was awesome but wish it had more steak inside. Also cheese is government yellow whiz. It's a philly tradition but be ready you will eat outside.
6714,9,1,1,2/16/2014,I hear the Geico gekko likes it.
6715,9,4,1,2/15/2014,Don't know why such a low review- cheesesteak was awesome the bread sealed the deal and put them ahead of pats for me.. Lost a star due to signage- We notice the racist signs as soon as we got on the premises they definitely are off putting and not necessary the establishment should remove.
6716,9,4,1,2/14/2014,Watched this on a tv network when I was still living in my native country. I didn't let it pass when I got a chance to request where I wanted to it! And It's at Geno's! Their cheese steak is simply tasty. :)
6717,9,4,1,2/13/2014,"Even though theres a lot of hate on here, Genos is still my go to when it comes to cheesesteaks. If you can get past the service, outdoor seating, and take it for the unique experience it is you cant go wrong. Genos serves up my favorite steaks. I love the large chop of the meat, and when you can actually get them, the peppers are bar none the best for a steak. If youve never been, definitely check out Genos!"
6718,9,4,1,2/13/2014,"A bit pricey, but the steak meat used is very good quality and steaks are done very consistently. ˜Menu is limited, but these guys are geared to ""move product"". ˜Get your steak ""whiz - with"", and don't dilly-dally in line."
6719,9,1,1,2/12/2014,"Geno's sucks, so does Pats - go to Steve's Prince of Steaks, or Tony Lukes"
6720,9,4,1,2/10/2014,"Pats or Ginos'? The great cheesesteak debate over which one is better, Gino's or Pats in South Philly has been raging for years. Ever since I first saw these two places featured, well, on just about every travel and food network I can think of, I always wanted to visit south Philadelphia to find out for myself. These places seemed to have so much character, and the cheesesteaks did look awesome. We were on the eve, literally, of opening up Jim's Bar and BBQ the following week when Ruthie said to me, ""Jim, if people find out about your BBQ, you are not going to have a weekend off for a very long time. Between editing Jim Baugh Outdoors, writing the second book ˜""COOKED"" and running a Bar and BBQ six days a week, this might be a good time to get out of town for the weekend. Could be our last chance for a very long time."" We arrived at Pats at around five o clock. I was at first surprised to see how close Pats and Gino's was. They almost mirror each other, each one just across the street from each other. We stood where Sylvester Stallone stood in the movie Rocky and began to figure out how to order our first cheese steak. We had been warned.... that you better have you order ready when you get to the window, or it could be trouble. Ruthie and I had a plan, we would order the same basic sandwich from each place, and spit each one and decided for ourselves which was better. As we found out, there is no looser here. Both where fantastic, however there was some clear differences, that may just end up being up to personal preference. In other words, do you like your onions seen??? Or so small they blend into the sandwich and not even notice they are there. That sort of thing, both are good, just which one would someone prefer. We ordered Pats first and Ruth almost bit my hand off, she was downing that thing fast, I could not get near it. It did look and taste fantastic. We ordered the standard, wiz, wit. Meaning Cheese With and onions. This Cheesesteak was really good. The meat seemed to be both chopped and also sliced. We gave it a 10, thought it was great, and also loved the way Pats had a bin of all fresh peppers. You could really make one awesome sandwich here, however we wanted to keep it simple for comparison, just the basics. Next, we happily walk across the street to Gino's. All the celeb pictures pasted all over the place was really fun. Once again we ordered without any problems, found a seat, and dug in. We both thought right from the start at Gino's, there was a marked difference between the two cheese steaks. Gino's sub roll was better. It was softer, hotter, and had more flavor. I do know a little something about bread baking, and even have two sourdough starters in my fridge. Gino's sub roll was better for sure. Next, the meat. Gino's was better, seemed to have more flavor. It was all sliced cuts of meat, and this may have been the difference. Next, the onions, WAY better at Gino's. They were cooked perfect, tender, and you could actually bite into one. VERY good. As far as the cheese wiz, no secret there, both Pats and Gino's offer the ""Wiz"" and for this sandwich I highly recommend doing the wiz. So, for Ruthie and I, we voted hands down Gino's for the best Philly cheese steak. No doubt both are fantastic. If you go, do what we did. Go to one, and then the other, everybody join in and decide for yourself which one you like best. If you ever go near Philadelphia, don't miss going to Pats and Gino's. These places are legendary and it is quite a treat to go there and experience there ambiance, and of course, world class Philly cheesesteaks. While we were happy to give Gino's our number one spot in our little taste tester, we of course were sad and of course disappointed to hear that Joey Vento passed away only two weeks prior to our trip. We had really looked forward to meeting him and am sure he will be truly missed by his legions of fans worldwide. RIP Joey Vento."
6721,9,1,1,2/8/2014,"In a word - WOOF. If you want to do the tourist thing - this is the cheesesteak for you. It's got wayyy too much gristle on it and it looks like Las Vegas. Plus, they don't even chop their steak correctly. Out of this hole or Pat's- I would go with Pat's. These are just underwhelming and not good at all. I assume their fame came from the giant lights and the rivalry with Pat's, but I don't like it here AT ALL. I also don't like their stance on the whole son of Italian immigrants posting a ""Speak English"" sign. Bottom Line: Go to John's Roast Pork"
6722,9,2,1,2/7/2014,A little overrated. I don't think I will be back. The meat didn't have much flavor and the cheese whiz was messy. The freedom fries were soggy. And it was almost $20 for just 2 sandwiches. Then I paid another $6 for a drink and fries. I feel like I could find a better ˜cheesesteak place or a more reasonable price.
6723,9,4,1,2/6/2014,"While I believe most Philadelphia residents are over the whole Pat's VS Geno's thing, and know very well that they can find similar (or better) cheesesteaks elsewhere, I still have to admit that Geno's (despite their politics) is the better of the two at this particular intersection."
6724,9,5,1,2/6/2014,"i came in from NY and had to stop by Geno's. Putting aside the rude people, the cheesteeak was delicious. i still need to try pat's, but this place was incredible. here's what i got: Cheesteak American Cheese Onions Hot Peppers Side of Cheese Fries It hit the spot. I'll definitely return!"
6725,9,1,1,2/5/2014,"Yuck. This place was so full of racist and ethnically hostile political signs against immigrants that I couldn't even bring myself to buy a cheesesteak from them, but I have tasted their steaks. ˜They're not very goodl. ˜I'm never going back to the place... When I first moved to Philly 5 years ago, a few friends from NYC visited and wanted to try Pat's and Geno's. ˜They're across the street from each other. ˜They seem like mostly tourist places. ˜At that point, I had never tried either. ˜Most of my friends ordered steaks at Geno's first, because it's the first place we encountered on our walk there. ˜So, I waited in line with my friends (prepared to order my own), but was shocked by all the extremely prejudiced and ethnically/racially hostile signs all over the place. ˜Seriously, I'm embarrassed this is a celebrated Philadelphia ""establishment,"" we should all be embarrassed about that type of ""in your face"" prejudice. ˜The people working behind the counter also seemed rude, so I went across the street to Pat's and picked up a cheesesteak. ˜ On the upside, Pat's wasn't full of offensive signs. ˜But both steaks were comparable, and not that great. Now I know that Jim's on South St. and Steve's Prince of Steaks in NorthEast Philly are the best classic cheese steaks in Philly. ˜If you want a good cheesesteak, try Jim's or Steve's: They're much better (delicious) cheesesteaks. ˜Plus, you won't be supporting that kind of blatant prejudice!"
6726,9,1,1,2/5/2014,"Just dont. Why short change yourself into getting two small pieces of unseasoned, frozen meat when you can go across the street and get a cheesesteak with ACTUAL steak in it. ˜ Say no to Geno."
6727,9,2,1,2/5/2014,"Please, this is just another tourist place. There are MANY MANY other steak shops in the area that are much better. Visitors always want to come to this place and they don't realize what they are missing by going to a different place...and not across the street to Pat's."
6728,9,2,1,2/4/2014,"In addition to the steaks being mediocre at best, the people were extremely rude. ˜I will not come here again."
6729,9,2,1,2/3/2014,...like across the street at Pat's. :)
6730,9,3,1,2/3/2014,"Geno's steaks is a typical tourist attraction. As for their steaks, they are alright, yet a little over priced. I would pass on the fries though, they are horrible. Customer service isn't the best either. But at the end of the day the steaks are still good."
6731,9,4,1,2/1/2014,"I haven't been there in a few years, but last time I was there it was good. ˜Could have used a little more meat on the roll, and a few less GD tourists at the window. ˜Kind of pricy, but the ingredients are good."
6732,9,1,1,1/29/2014,"I'd been told to come here by so people that I made the cardinal sin of not checking Yelp first. My bad. My sandwich was awful. In fact, I'd had a tastier, cheaper, and healthier Philly cheesesteak at Charlie's in the Columbus airport before coming here. Z."
6733,9,3,1,1/29/2014,"I liked the cheesesteak and service here better than the place across the street. The people here are NOT annoyingly rude. The place is cleaner and overall, I had a better experience here. Their cheesesteak has juicy beef SLICES, whiz on the bottom of the beef and their cheesesteak is bigger than the one from Pat's across the street. They have cherry soda and freedom fries. Open 24/7. I guess the original owner, Vento was a DB but I would be too if I had a view of the DB's at Pat's everyday I come to work. If you really want good Philly cheesesteaks, stay away from this street and go somewhere else. If you want history but not good food, then by all means come here and Pat's."
6734,9,1,1,1/27/2014,"I only go to Pats King of Steaks, go ahead do a blind taste test, there is no comparison!!"
6735,9,2,1,1/26/2014,"With as much hype as this place it couldn't have been more of a letdown. Pat's is better, Tony Luke's is ions better. Geno's seemed like a spot staying in business from one-time customers who follow the hype, give it a try and then never return. The flavor/bread fell far short of what we all expected."
5128,9,1,1,1/24/2014,"This tourist trap has a sign that says "" Order Only In English"". The Late owner, Tony Vento, was a fan of inflammatory conservative vocal-vomit. He was a darling of the ˜'Merica idiots that think waiting in line for 30 minutes for a tasteless cheesesteak is authentic. You'd think someone with the ˜surname Vento, which wreaks of steerage, would be more sensitive to our countries long history of immigration. But whatever, I digress. Three Things: 1. Getting a cheesesteak from the corner bodega when you are staring at a double shift at your soulless wage job, working for the self-satisfied Tony Ventos of the World is authentic. 2. Scarfing down a cheese steak made from steakums your mom bought on sale from the Acme is authentic. 3. Getting a cheese steak for 4 bucks from a food cart during your too short lunch break from a guy 'Merica idiots think is taking are jobs is authentic. Paying over $7 in line with people from places I've never wanted to visit who put cheezewiz on their steak is Not AUTHENTIC. I grew up in South Philly and have only been here once. Rude subhumans serve the food and Rude subhumans wait in line. I'm ashamed to have gone here."
6736,9,3,1,1/23/2014,A must-go due to the tradition and atmosphere but definitely a mid-tier cheesesteak. ˜Cost is higher for less meat. ˜Pat's is way better and of course Jim's is the best.
6737,9,1,1,1/22/2014,"The only thing I liked about Geno's was the pretzel bun, aside from that, I thought it was ordinary. I didn't like the cut of the meat and the signs were a bit tacky, asking for too much attention to win over customers. I did not like their English-only ordering policy. It really is unnecessary and a complete turn off. It left a bad impression of Philly for me."
6738,9,1,1,1/21/2014,Hype and all flash...no substance...over priced...got bad stomach pains...tourist crap. ˜Hey tourists there are way better places than Pat's or Geno's. ˜They have gotten sloppy.
6739,9,1,1,1/21/2014,"What a disappointment. After hearing and seeing all the hype about this place, I specifically drove two hours to see what all the hype was about. The meat was dry and there was more onions than meat in the sandwich. I've honestly tasted better steak and cheese here in DC! Luckily we tried 2 other steak joints that were a little better so my trip to ˜Philly wasn't a total waste."
6740,9,5,1,1/20/2014,WHAT? Why does this not have higher ratings? Sure Pats has awesome cheesesteaks but I like the way the onions are cooked here and the way they cut their meat. It was easier for me to chew and they add more onions! The cheese wiz tastes great as I expected and the staff is friendly and prompt. Who knew a cheesesteak could be better than sex. I'm kidding. But who wouldn't want both?
6741,9,2,1,1/20/2014,More of a tourist attraction than a trusted local spot. ˜The steaks are greasy and fatty and make me want to gag.
6742,9,2,1,1/19/2014,Over price and over rated. Customer service is not the same as 15 years ago. ˜An employee at geno told me to get a cup from pats since I was holding a pats bag. ˜My friend and I eat from both places and never pats ever blew me off... I think they forgot where they came from.
6743,9,2,1,1/17/2014,It's a cool place to bring a friend who has never been to the city but the quality of the food is pretty bad. ˜Its's a nice tourist spot and I only go when friends are in town. There are so many better places in Philly They do at great job at keeping the line moving
6744,9,4,1,1/17/2014,You gotta try both of 'em once.
6745,9,2,1,1/17/2014,"Why? I mean I can now say I've gotten an actually philly cheesesteak and it's just sadly disappointing. With wiz or without whatever it's really just kind of sad. Particularly for when it's almost 10 bucks and parking is a bitch. I ended up going somewhere else to eat another cheesesteak (not Pat's) in the same night, just to get the taste out of my mouth basically."
6746,9,1,1,1/15/2014,"Slop on a bun. Tourist trap. Genos nd Pats are a disgrace to philly. If you want stakeums with kraft singles, go here. If you want a real cheesesteak, go to the million other places in the city. If you're lucky, many owner Geno will be there and give you a nice racist rant about Illegal immigrants. If you're not from here, AVOID AVOID AVOID."
6747,9,3,1,1/14/2014,both pats and genos would get 5 stars if all of their products were knocked down about 3$ a piece.
6748,9,5,1,1/13/2014,"In war of Pats vs Geno, I choose Geno's. I know that a lot of my Philly peeps are gonna kick me but sorry I like Geno's. The cut of the beef is better at Pats but it's not much different when you are wolfing down a cheesesteak. But the pure difference for me is the taste. Geno's just taste better! My ""Whiz wit 'rooms"" is just juicy and filled with yummy goodness. It makes u lick up your fingers after you are done. My recommendation is go buy both and do your taste test. I do it everytime I come to Philly and I always pick geno's!"
6749,9,2,1,1/12/2014,"It was our first visit to Philly so we just had to do the cheesesteak thing. ˜Since every local will tell you a different spot for their favorite place we said to ourselves, ""Hey, why not try all of them!"" ˜So we had 4 cheesesteaks in a span of 2 days. Felt like shat afterwards, needless to say. Here's my review of Geno's below along with three other famous spots (all wiz wit since we didn't like the provolone): Geno's: The ordering process was pretty quick. ˜Meat was most flavorful according to others in our group. My only complaint but a major one would be the bread. ˜It was pretty chewy. That pretty much ruined the sandwich experience there for me. Pat's: Right down the street from Geno's, we actually ordered the Provolone here but wished I would've tried the wiz. ˜The bread here was much better and meat to onion to bread ratio was perfect. Tony Luke's: The wait here was longer than Pat's and Geno's but worth it. ˜You get free pickles and sweet peppers here which is pretty cool. ˜My only complaint is that they don't put in enough onions or else it could have been more flavorful. Jim's: This place seems to be growing in popularity quickly and I think might be newer out of the four spots. ˜The line was pretty long but you do get to see how they make the sandwiches right through the glass pane in front. ˜It was unorganized when I was there, they forgot to give me my order of sweet peppers and over charged me a sandwich while one guy was throwing me attitude on top of it. ˜The sandwich seemed to be lacking in flavor though. ˜I know this sounds terrible but it was lacking that old school grease! LOL ˜Also, check out their upstairs dining area where you can find autographed photos of celebs that have dined there (who is DeMzel Washington?? haha). Here's my overall rating starting with the best: 1) Pat's 2) Tony Luke's 3) Jim's 4) Geno's There will never be one clear winner for the cheesesteak king title since there are so many differing opinions out there but it's still fun tasting them all to figure out for yourself! Then go run a few miles afterwards."
6750,9,3,1,1/11/2014,Their cheesesteaks are SO delicious. So are Pat's. And they are both rude & snotty as hell. Why can't you just be nice to people? Some of us are not from Philly and did not study your ordering lingo. Get over yourselves.
6751,9,2,1,1/9/2014,NOt much to the sandwich and a lot of grissle in the meat
6752,9,5,1,1/9/2014,oh hell yes.
6753,9,3,1,1/8/2014,"Lets do it! Given all the hype, and that ˜Geno's is in competition with their neighboring Pat's , well, I expected more. ˜Neither blew the other away, and yes, I had both within an hour of the other. ˜It was great to play the ""judging game"", but in the end neither was out of this world. I was a little sad. Y es, this is the same comment I left for Pat's. ˜Make sense?"
6754,9,4,1,1/7/2014,Stopped in while on Vacation. Parking is rough. ˜If you cant parallel park your screwed. ˜ ˜Not a ton of places to sit but just meet some new friends. Sandwiches are amazing and totally worth the trip!!
6755,9,4,1,1/7/2014,"Always Love Geno's steaks!!!! Definatly go there. careful the hot sauce, its HOT and i like spicy."
6756,9,3,1,1/6/2014,Good
6757,9,1,1,1/5/2014,"After driving in PA for an hour, desperately hungry, we swerved off I-95 on the hunt for something to fill our appetites. After driving around in some questionable areas of Philly, we came upon this beacon of light in the freezing rain. We wondered out loud... Isn't this that famous place? All I wanted was warm cheesy goodness but I got tasteless meat with a spritz of cheese between a semi-fresh roll. Maybe the onions we left out are the secret ingredient, but I was appalled at the low quality of meat and low quantity of cheese at one of the most famous places in Philly! This couldn't hold a candle to even the cheesesteaks at Rutgers dining hall.. and that's pretty bad."
6758,9,5,1,1/5/2014,"Best cheesesteak in the world, Great owner, god bless him. Just order and taste for yourself. Enough said."
6759,9,1,1,1/4/2014,"Ordered 1 wiz wid, and 1 wiz widout. The guy at the counter gave me an attitude throughout this whole process. I got my money ready, I placed my order, basically one with wiz and onions and one without the onions for my pal who can't have onions at this time due to recent abdominal surgery. I don't know the details of his operation but doctors told him to stay away from onions and other foods. I think it's because of the acidity or something. I don't know, don't care and I'm not a doctor. With that said, the guy at the counter from Geno's kept busting our chops and mocking us about how you can't have a philly cheesesteak without the onions. He kept going on and on, his mouth didn't stop just like the owner Joey Vento. So I let this jerk finish up our sandwiches, I paid for it and handed him back the cheesesteaks he made and walked away from the window. Verdict - Fuggedaboutit! Where I come from, we don't take shit from nobody! We're American born too but these guys at Geno's tend to discriminate against foreigners and people who they think are foreigners but are not. We're the ones traveling the distance and paying for their product. Show your customers some respect if you want our cold hard cash! Without us, you wouldn't have any dough to pay for your tacky light displays."

6764,9,3,1,1/2/2014,"Pros: Cheese steaks are better here than at Pat's, which is located across the street. Cons: Whiz cheese is default so ask for American or Provolone cheeses for a healthier option. No indoor seating options, but the Satellite Garage Bar across the street offers indoor seating and bring your own cheese steak with purchase of a drink. Long lines, but the wait isn't terrible. Good service is not needed due to the popularity of this place. Cash only."
6765,9,1,1,1/2/2014,"Having once lived in the neighborhood, one comes to hear stories and realizes how disgustingly racist this establishment is. Their steaks are no good and neither are their ethics. If you're looking for an authentic Philly steak, try elsewhere."
6766,9,5,1,1/2/2014,Love this place
6767,9,3,1,1/1/2014,"We drove down to Philly and tried both Pat's and Geno's. ˜ Pat's service is no good. ˜Geno's is better. Pat's steak is OK, but Geno's is softer. Topping ... ˜well Pat's has more choices and I do like Pat's toppings more than Geno's. So Pat's verse Geno's? ˜Each is not super good. ˜:("
6768,9,4,1,1/1/2014,"Yep, great place, classic, what you can come to expect from a solid Philadelphia cheese steak joint"
6769,9,4,1,1/1/2014,Prefer it to Pat's...can't say why.
6770,9,4,1,1/1/2014,Genos over pats everyday all day.....but Steve's prince of steaks in the northeast is still the best
6771,9,3,1,12/31/2013,"Geno's bread is way better than Pat's. That's probably why I'd give them a slight nod. Having said that, there's way better places in Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak than either Pat's or Geno's. Definitely go and sample both if you haven't ever been, get the history out of the way, then go to some of the other spots that are way better (Tony Luke's or Dalesandro's to name a couple)"
6772,9,1,1,12/31/2013,"Small, over-priced cheese steak. The staff is incredibly rude. I mean maybe this is their schtick but I will not go there again. BTW, clean up your trash."
6773,9,2,1,12/30/2013,"Think of a place that was prob once really good, got alot of attention and hype, then became complacent. This is that place. I heard about this place from a friend who said it was deeliiiiicious. And going there, I saw the hype of the place but it didnt match up to its food. I ordered a Philly cheesesteak, everything on it with American cheese. I got a sandwich with cold steak, barely any provolone cheese and way too many onions. ˜ I was with a party of five, three of which did get provolone and two american. but i guess that was too much for them to handle and just decided to give us all provolone. We would've gone back for them to change it but the line was too long And we had already gotten into our car. The only reason they got a second star was because the bread was pretty good. All in all, don't believe the hype."
6774,9,3,1,12/30/2013,"Now that I've been here, I don't need to waste time here on future Philly trips. The best thing about the cheesesteak here was the bread... It was better than Pat's. But the meat and cheese we're not very appetizing. Didn't try the fries so they might be good, but I don't think I'll be back."
6775,9,2,1,12/30/2013,"Just not a good cheesesteak. ˜If you're there, you have to go with Pats. ˜The overall arrogance of the employees and of the buildings appearance itself is enough of a turnoff. ˜Take the challenge yourself. ˜Bring a friend, get a Geno's, get a Pats, split them, and you decide."
6776,9,4,1,12/29/2013,Their bread was soggy but the meat on point delicious better than pats king of steaks ˜did a taste check with celina and Steve between geno and pats king of steaks and geno takes my vote!
6777,9,5,1,12/27/2013,"Geno's is a staple of the community. Throughout all the controversy surrounding this place, Joey Vento, stood his ground and always gave back to the community. The man had an impeccable work ethic and ran an efficient business. It is sad to no longer see him and his smiling face as he greeted customers. The cheesesteak is a staple of Philadelphia. While the sandwich is not the best in the city its the best in neighborhood and I respect the passion of the employees and the business. The service is always friendly and high paced. I've never had a bad experience. Its great at 7am when they are cooking onions and that smell just lofts through the area. Nothing like a cheesesteak for breakfast."
6778,9,2,1,12/27/2013,Another tourist trap. Much better steaks in Philly than Geno's or the competing Pat's.
6779,9,2,1,12/26/2013,"I'm really handsome. Also, this place is highly...traditional, provided you are of the opinion that it is traditionally American to be rude, impatient, and resistant to change. The cheese-steak itself was really nothing outstanding, particularly in light of two things: 1. I was heavily intoxicated when I tried this place, and still was not impressed. Almost any food impresses me while drunk, even the offerings of the honorable Chef Boyardee. 2. I'm convinced that the average person could make more appealing cheese steaks in the comfort of their own homes. This also provides the advantage of avoiding the staff. Although the steak itself was not outstanding, I will admit that the overall dingy and filthy appearance and vibe of this place both made quite an impression. The hot sauce was fairly powerful, as well. Geno's is a fine counter-argument to anyone of the opinion that you must have the..""Experience"" anywhere."
6780,9,4,1,12/26/2013,"Whenever I'm in town it's one of the spots I have to go. Good steaks, good prices and you gotta love being in S. Philly. Lifelong fan!"
6781,9,2,1,12/26/2013,"I went to both Pat's & Geno's based on their reputation. I also saw a show on the travel channel about these 2 places & figured I would give them a chance. My girlfriend & I split 1 Philly from each place so we could try them both. Neither place was good. Both places meat lacked flavor & the breads were soggy. According to several locals, there are much better places to get Phillys in Philly. ** I think Publix in Tampa, FL makes a better Philly than both of these places."
6782,9,5,1,12/25/2013,"For my first blog, I was in Philadelphia for New Years Eve so I went to my favorite cheesesteak place, Geno's. ˜While many debate the best cheesesteaks in Philly, my personal perference is the ultra-American Geno's. One thing that I love about Geno's is the hours of operation. ˜Given that I went on New Years Eve, one might expect Geno's to be closed, especially given the fact that the cross-street rival Pat's was not serving. ˜Instead, the hardworking Geno's staff is open 24/7/365, ensuring that I can always get my favorite cheesesteak and that the neighborhood is always aglow thanks to the massive neon signs adorning the outside of this landmark spot. Although the lines tend to differ depending on when you go, we hit a peak time and the line wrapped partway around the block. ˜However, the system of serving up the cheesesteaks helps the line move along at a rapid pace so it only took us about 25 minutes to get to the window. Upon arriving at the window, you notice the bumper stickers they have posted illustrating their support for police, ordering in English, and contempt for anything un-American. ˜The ˜establishment is cash only and they prefer you to order a specific way, stating simply the type of cheese first and then ""wit"" or ""witout"" onions. ˜Thats it. ˜Don't bother asking for mushrooms, lettuce, or any other silly condiments on a true Philly cheesesteak. ˜You can, however, add a few limited condiments yourself after getting your food. ˜The service is not exceptionally welcoming, but the setup is built to get the customer their food promptly so that is not a major detractor. ˜Geno's is also a cash-only place, so don't expect to come with just a credit card in hand. The variety on the menu is limited to cheesesteaks and roast pork sandwiches with fries, cheese fries and sodas available at a separate window, but come on, when your going to Geno's, everyone is getting a cheesesteak. ˜The prices are not cheap, with a cheesesteak costing $8.50 and a cup of cheese fries putting you back $4.50. ˜ I ordered a cup of cheese fries to eat while waiting in line. ˜Given our hunger and the thick coating of cheese, we downed these in no time. ˜I cannot tell for sure if it was my hunger and anticipation but I felt that the fries were great. ˜We then went on to order our cheesesteaks, her getting a Whiz With, while I ordered a Whiz Without. ˜One thing I love about Geno's Steaks is the fact that they offer whiz, a cheese that too few restaurants offer outside of Philly. ˜The cheese was nice and gooey like whiz should be and though it could have stood to be a little heavier on the cheese, the mixture of cheese, bread, and meat really worked. Although I do not usually like grilled onions, Geno's makes it work well on the cheesesteak. ˜The onions were placed on the grill but hardly grilled giving them a nice crunch that worked well on the cheesesteak. ˜The meat was well prepared using nice, thinly sliced ribeye pieces (not chopped up though) with a little bit of fat on it to give it some juice and flavor. ˜ ˜ The bread was the biggest difference between a Philly cheesesteak and a cheesesteak from elsewhere. ˜Delivered from up the street, the amoroso rolls they use do not overpower the sandwich by being too thick but instead offer a soft roll that is at the same time firm enough to handle the cheesesteak. ˜The sandwich really comes together with a perfect blend of meat, cheese, and a terrific bread roll. ˜Everyone has their favorite cheesesteak place, but mine is definitely Geno's topping its cross-street rival Pat's King of Steaks. ˜That being said, look for blog reports on some of the other well known Philly cheesesteak joints in the future. Ratings: Meat: 7.5 Bread: 10 Cheese: 9 Cost: 6 Overall Combination: 10"
6783,9,1,1,12/24/2013,"I would give them 0 stars if possible!! This place was no good at all... Meat was dry with no flavor. They were so rude and racist... Can't order if you don't speak English!!! This would not fly in LA and quite frankly I wish they would come to LA and see what customer service is all about. They need lessons and take customer service 101. No sense if urgency. Bread is hard and difficult to chew with dry meat, dry customer service!!! STAY AWAY!!"
6784,9,2,1,12/24/2013,I did the steak challenge with my boyfriend. ˜He got a steak from Geno's and I got one from Pat's and we split them and then compared. ˜Pat's won. ˜Geno's was fine and the difference between Pat's was not that significant but with Pat's right there there is no reason to go to Geno's. ˜The steak was not as flavorful or as juicy. ˜i think more people from out of town are attracted to Geno's because of all of the marketing bling they have but if you want a better tasting steak go to Pat's.
6785,9,1,1,12/23/2013,"This place is terrible!! The meat was dry and cutt to thick with no flavor. To top it off they are racist and horrible service-not friendly at all. When we got to the window, there was a sign saying if you don't speak English you can't order.. a little racists.its all good I will never go to this place again and anybody that ask, I will tell them not to go as well.. I'm also going to contact the food networks that advertised this sh!T HOLE and ask them to remove these Jack's.. the food was terrible and the attitudes were as dry as their cheese steaks."
6786,9,3,1,12/23/2013,"I have only had Geno's once. And it was during the Great Steak Off of 2011. What? You don't know about the Great Steak Off? Well, the Great Steak Off was that time I thought it would be brilliant to go to the most popular steak spots in Philly and try all of the variety of steaks (prov, whiz, onions, no onions, peppers, you name it), at once, while washing them all down with a vintage bottle of Perrier Jou?t champagne. Ahem. Well, Geno's was my least favorite. The prov was not prov-y enough. ˜ The bread got too soggy and the meat was cut too large. But the champagne was fabulous. So there's that."
6787,9,1,1,12/22/2013,"Just wrote the same review for Pats, so Genos gets the same, because it's equally as bad... ----- Alright, since no one else will say it, I will: This is the worst cheesesteak anywhere in the world. ˜It skimpy, over priced and barely edible (on a good night). Pats and Genos compete with each other...Yeah, they certainly do.....to see who can charge the most for disgusting inedible food! It's embarassing that our famous (and yummy) chesesteak is so closely related with this place! PR at it's very best. That is all...."
6788,9,2,1,12/20/2013,I am in Philadelphia and the philly steaks in CA are much better than this. BOOOOOOOO. It's really gross and disgusting. I feel like they need to put more love in their sandwiches.. i mean.. they can slow down a bit making them...but don't be serving what looks like a bird crapped cheese whiz all over some meat. Ew. I don't like how they sliced their meats. So many things I don't like about this place. JUST GO NEXT DOOR.
6789,9,5,1,12/20/2013,This place has the very ˜best cheese steaks in philly other then pats either way I can't go wrong!
6790,9,4,1,12/17/2013,Win! we did the taste comparison to Pat's and Geno's wins hands down. The meat taste like it's better quality and the people were super friendly. I was visiting from Cali and the nice guy gave me a pen for a souvenir!
6791,9,1,1,12/17/2013,Pats
6792,9,1,1,12/17/2013,"Pat's is better did it because you have to if your in philly for the first time but will not go back they seem pretty adamant about expressing their political beliefs too, nothing wrong with that but as a costumer, that is a turn-off"
6793,9,2,1,12/17/2013,"I usually think Geno's is a good idea, because it looks cleaner than Pat's. And with the glaring lights and xenophobic signs, you have to admit they put on a good show. But as far as cheesesteaks go, Geno's is just not that good. ˜The meat is pre-cooked and heated up when you order, and it's never actually served hot. If you're going for the tourist thing, try Pat's instead."
6794,9,1,1,12/16/2013,We were so excited to go here. My fiance and another couple were driving to NYC and decided to stop in Philly for a authentic Philly. We tried both Pats and Geno. Both were bland... The meat had no seasoning. We even had the peppers on it... and they bother were disgusting. we were so upset. It is a tourist trap. The disappointing factor is that we have seen this on countless episodes on the food network and when you pull up to these places... it looks awesome with the neon lights... I was so hype to try one. The line was long and the phily came out before my eyes completed one full cycle of blinking. Word of advice to anyone... with the question of Pat or Genos... answer is NEITHER. I think I will try a true local place. I hate peperjack grill but I would prefer the over Pat and Geno. Just as the other posters stated... they were sort of rude.
6795,9,4,1,12/16/2013,"If you are coming to Philly to get a great cheesesteak you have to come here. Are there better ones? Sure. But Geno's is a staple. I actually prefer Geno's over Pat's slightly because I've always found their rolls to be better. Don't get me wrong, these are delicious cheesesteaks! I usually eat them two at a time. But since I drive through Philly relatively often, I go to Tony Luke's to get my steaks now. All in all this is a great cheesesteak and if it's your first time to Philly do it for the tourist factor!"
6796,9,3,1,12/15/2013,Pretty good!!
6797,9,1,1,12/14/2013,"Both Pats and Geno's are not big on customer service. ˜If I return to Philly I wouldn't visit again. ˜Not too much different from others who reviewed. ˜I went to pats first. ˜There wasn't anyone there so the attendant started asking me to order. ˜I was trying to figure out what I wanted and he kept asking so I said Philly wit onions... He said cheese? I said yes. ˜He said shoulda told me that... No worries. ˜I got my sandwich and begin to eat it. ˜I decided to save some for later and try Geno's. ˜mistake... I had the other half of my sandwich in hand and my husband was in line at Geno's to order their sandwich. ˜I went to get a napkin. ˜One of the guys said... Don't use our napkins with that pats sandwich in your hand. ˜Those are for paying customers only. ˜I apologized and tried to clear up the misunderstanding to no avail. ˜Me... I apologize. ˜My husband is in line for one of your sandwiches. ˜We want to compare and take the food challenge. ˜Another geno employee came from the back and says...we paid for those not pats. ˜I said I understand I think their is a misunderstanding. ˜The guy said no their isn't. ˜We don't want your money. ˜Ok....we left. ˜I didnt try the sandwich, the review is for the service. ˜I wouldn't recommend either. ˜We will try tony lukes next time. ˜Have fun and tourist beware"
6798,9,2,1,12/14/2013,"Any trip to Philadelphia would not be complete without at least eating one cheesesteak sandwich so on this occasion had a few hours before my flight I decided why not try both at once. I went with the cheese steak with onions, mushrooms and provolone cheese and have to say that Pats compared to Gino's had the upper hand on multiple levels and I felt as if while Geno's was more friendly and looked nicer on the block the food was not comparable. Starting with steak I felt as if it really had no flavor to it and it almost seemed as if it was like gyro meat cut from a pole and wasn't cooked on the grill didn't have all the flavor. The onions were very undercooked it seemed as if they were just kind of thrown into the mix the mushrooms same exact thing and actually we're not even warm and felt as if they just came out of the can. The bread was rather soggy and really lacking for a cheese steak. The positive side, the people at Gino's were very friendly and the store looks a lot nicer not to mention the line was shorter but the good quality was not worth returning for what I ordered. Oh, and they charged me an extra $.50 for the same item I got across the street Next time in Philly I will do the same thing and see If I get better results, but for now its really only worth 2 stars..."
6799,9,4,1,12/13/2013,"Great steaks, great Philly vibe. I would definitely go there again/recommend to a friend!"
6800,9,5,1,12/13/2013,great
6801,9,1,1,12/12/2013,"The lady rushed me and said next because I took long to order, (wasn't that long). ˜ You get paid by the hour, not by customer. ˜She never smiles and she looks miserable. ˜Even though she was rude, I feel bad for her that she can't understand that she gets paid Hourly and is hurting the business. ˜Who say's NEXT!!!???? ˜I don't even get treated like that when I'm ordering from a hot dog cart"
6802,9,3,1,12/12/2013,"Geno's Steaks-- they're cheesesteaks are just greasy, cheesy, meaty goodness, but honestly not as good as I expected for like an ""authentic original."" I've had both Geno's and Pat's and I honestly prefer Geno's because I think their steak is a little better, but they're very similar. But it was still a great late night meal!"
6803,9,3,1,12/11/2013,"I've been eating these since I was a kid. It's kind of a Philly thing. My dad would every so often tear us away from other better haunts (eg. Chink's, a shady corner deli Germantown that didn't even have a sign, Tony Luke's, Steve's, etc) to go down to South Philly and fight the tourists. I'm not going to bash Pat's and Geno's. You're going here for the experience, not the food. And often you see people there you haven't seen around in a while. [For the record: I always preferred Geno's for steaks (extra o, provolone) and Pat's for waffle fries (extra cheese). ] I took my husband and son to Pat's on their first Philly visit. They were unimpressed. ""Is *this* the famous steak sandwich?"" I just sighed and said ""If I didn't bring you here, everyone would ask why you didn't go. So now next time we visit, I can take you to get a great steak."" LOL"
6804,9,4,1,12/11/2013,"Geno's was not my favorite. I got whiz with onions. My 'complaint' is that they put the whiz on the bun and not on top of the meat. The cheese should be on top so that it sinks down and covers all the meat. Not my favorite, but you have to try both Geno's and Pat's (across the street) per tradition! My Favorite Cheesesteaks in order: 1. Pat's 2. Jim's Steaks 3. Geno's 4. Campo's Slightly far from the rest of historic Philly/regular tourist stuff, but the cab ride was only about $13 from the zoo (far) and it is very easy to catch another cab when leaving Geno's"
6805,9,1,1,12/10/2013,note - geno's and pat's right across the street from each other! among the oldest steak places in philly! con's - not the best cheesesteak - not even close not the cleanest/newest equipment not the highest quality ingredients ratio of badly prepared hoagies are too high expensive pro's - bucket list item open 24/7
6806,9,4,1,12/10/2013,It's good when your hungry after a night out.
6807,9,3,1,12/7/2013,"I would love to say this Philly Icon is absolutely great, but it is just OK. Love the cheese steaks, love the fries, but they are over priced and under sized. Maybe because there are other much better cheese steak places not far away, but Geno's would benefit on living less on the hype and more on the really good steak they started up on."
6808,9,1,1,12/7/2013,"Racist + bad cheesesteaks= giving Philly a bad rep. Don't waste your time here, go to John's Roast Pork or Tony Luke's if you want a real south Philly experience. Or even Jim's on south street is way better."
6809,9,1,1,12/6/2013,Ignorant and racist signs all over the place. Don't support these people.
6810,9,3,1,12/5/2013,Worth checking out but I am a Pat's man myself.
6811,9,4,1,12/4/2013,"Good - and yes, sometimes it's better than Pat's, but Pat's is still better by default at this point."
6812,9,1,1,12/4/2013,"If you have to go to one of the tourist traps, go to Pats. ˜Geno's is overpriced and not nearly as flavorful as some of the other well known spots."
6813,9,2,1,12/2/2013,"Geno's is a solid two stars. I've always found the meat to be a bit grissly. In order, I prefer Tony Luke's, Jim's, Pat's, then Geno's. For a chicken cheesesteak you can't beat Ishkabibble's on South street."
6814,9,4,1,12/2/2013,"My family and I have a slight obsession with philly cheesesteaks. My grandfather lived in Philly for a while and when he moved to California with his kids, he instilled a love for cheesesteaks in them and his grandchildren as well. However, I always love a chance to go to the famous Geno's or Pat's. Though I have no true loyalty having only been to each once, I really enjoyed Geno's a lot. Being a 'foreigner' to Philly, I did not quite know the right lingo to order, and though I'm sure all the employees were laughing at me, they helped me out and got my cheesesteak to me promptly. It's a Philadelphia classic and I definitely recommend it to all. In all honesty, if I didn't think I would get immensely judged by my cousin who was with me, I would have ordered three and devoured them."
6815,9,1,1,12/2/2013,"I'm sorry my fellow yelpers. In my happiness of being in Philly and having my mind occupied by the sights. I forgot to use the trusted reviews of yelp before I visited this hell hole of a place. I felt like processed meat. Place took my order and before my mouth was done articulating what I wanted I was handed a sandwich. A terrible one at that,with what tasted like old bread, non melted cheese, and crappy mushrooms. I get the feelings these guys look at customers like they're the ones doing us the favor. As if, if you're not from Philadelphia and are a tourist, the smugness comes out. The off putting signs are hilarious considering it's the city of brotherly love. Please pass on this place and at the very least take your money and visualization of a good Philly cheesesteak to pats."
6816,9,1,1,12/1/2013,Racist sign on the front window. I'd rather eat at Pat's where the service is friendly and they actually listen to your request.
6817,9,3,1,12/1/2013,"Looking for the best cheesesteak in Philly? Look elsewhere. If you're looking for one of two proud Philadelphia establishments deadlocked in a tense battle for the glory of originality, look no further. Pat's is an experience, and I would recommend trying it...once. After that, look elsewhere for the tastiest cheesesteak."
6818,9,3,1,12/1/2013,"I tried Genos, Jim's, and Pats side by side since there was no line for either. Vs Pats : Genos cost 50c less coming in at $9.50 Genos gave a larger roll and had toasted bread which was better than Pats. However there was much less meat and cheese on Genos, and the meat was not as flavorful. Vs Jims: Better bread but similar taste in meat and cheese. Costs about $1 more than Jims Genos does have the better bread out of all the places but not enough to make up for taste. Rankings #1 Pats #2 Geno's #3 Jim's"
6819,9,1,1,11/30/2013,"This place isn't all it's cracked up to be! I was in town to get passports done for my family and I and since we had a few hours to kill we decided to go to Genos. First off, let me start by saying the people who work here are complete racist a-holes. You can't ask them a question without them jumping down your throat or giving you a dirty look. After dealing with their attitudes,!we got the sandwiches and they were cold and flavorless. I really wish we would have tried Pats across the street. Never again!"
6820,9,2,1,11/30/2013,"I didn't really care for this place. The staff was kinda rude and the cheesesteak wasn't that spectacular. It was not enough meat and it was barely hot. Glad I tried it, but if I'm ever back in philly I will just walk across the street."
6821,9,5,1,11/29/2013,"I was actually shocked at all the negative reviews that Geno's got, maybe its because I'm not from Philly, maybe its because I expected terrible parking or a rough, uncut, no nonsense South Philadelphia approach to service or maybe its because I was just hungry but I found Geno's to be an excellent restaurant with amazing cheesesteaks. A relative who lived in Philly for many years told us that we had to try both Pat's and Geno's when we went up there and the only way we could try them was with cheese whiz. So we did. Ordered up a ""whiz wit"" (the wit is ""with onions"" oh and remember, cash only) and in a matter of second our piping hot pile of meat, onions bread and cheese was presented to us. I was amazing : Course cut steak covered with melted cheese and onions. Nothing elsewhere in the US can compare. Now the question is which was better: Pat's or Geno's? I have to say that while I love Geno's cheese whiz more I'd have to say Pat's has the better meat. So I'm torn. Looks like I'll just have to get one from both places again the next time I'm in Philly."
6822,9,3,1,11/28/2013,"Definitely a good steak place in Philly, but in my opinion pales in comparison to their neighbor."
6823,9,2,1,11/27/2013,"Why go to Geno's? Really, why? Cosmi's is very close to Geno's and is a top 5 cheesesteak. I don't think either Geno's or Pat's is superior, but Pat's isn't bright orange and doesn't have neon all over it."
6824,9,1,1,11/26/2013,"I went to Philly for the day, and I thought to myself ""Why not get a STEAK AND CHEESE... FROM PHILLY"" The parking is horrible in this area, the workers were rude, and on top of that they wanted their patrons to order in such a stupid manner. Something about ""Wit Wiz"" or something stupid like that, and if you didnt order that way you werent served, as the poster says. The sub contained like 6 strips of meat and their special sub was a steak and cheese.. but my friends, not regular american cheese!! I need a drum roll... CHEESE!!! FROM A CAN!!!!!! CANNED CHEESE OMG YES!!!! It was not what I expect from Philadelphia. On top of that this establishment had a sense of a racist vibe as a sign said ""We speak English in America we wont take another language"" While I follow the same logic I find the person who posted this on their glass wall a DISGUSTING PIG, If I ever met you I would tell it like it is you racist SCUM Screw this place, All you Yelpers! Dont let Philly fool you, funny how the BEST Steak and cheese ive ever had in my LIFE is at Carl's Sub in WALTHAM, MASSACHUSETTS."
6825,9,2,1,11/26/2013,i went back in october for the 2nd time in 9 years. back in 2004 my friends and i went to pats and genos and we agreed that pats had better bread and genos had better meat. however when i was there back in october pats was better all around. the meat at genos was too greasy. ˜not a bad sandwich but not as good as the other places.
6826,9,1,1,11/26/2013,"I am so disappointed with this place. I have heard all the hype for years pats vs genos and most people who I trust say genos is better. But come on man this is like a sick joke. I have had better cheese steaks at pizza places and malls from Miami to Baltimore, so I thought Philly would have the best Philly cheese steak. As far as the ""best"" goes that is definitely not anything I saw today. All the hype this place has somehow garnered over the years has created a monster. It is a shame that has been plaguing hotels and restaurants more than ever lately; this place is living off its own legend, riding its own coattails, and doing its customers and previous employees a disservice. It's almost as if they no longer care about what they serve. First off, there is no parking anywhere nearby literally it's a mess in this area if you aren't a local. The steak was ok at best the onions nonexistent the mushrooms rubbery and tasteless on their own. The worst of all, the bun, if you have the audacity to call it that. I would liken it more to a rubber chew toy you find in the tiny pet accessory section in a local food store. The cheese wasn't even melted! I could get over the lack of indoor seating and the fact that even in the 30* weather you have to take your gloves off and roll up your sleeves to avoid getting mystery oil (no way could you call it au jous) and ketchup all over you. Even the attitude from cashier. Three things were truly appalling to me here. 1) everything was premade. Our food was in front of us before we even finished ordering. Ew. Um how long has that been there? What if I was allergic to something in there and needed it custom? 2) The price was outrageous especially for how little food we even were served...in an outdoor restaurant....with no parking lot....and counter service....food cost should at least be mildly related to cost of food, utilities, and staff. $21 for two ""subs"" is insane! And the worst thing about this place: 3) they have the worlds most horrendously racist sign right on the cashier window. ""This is America. Speak English when ordering."" Oh my god. This is Philadelphia, the city of brotherly love. Unless your brother happens to be one of the thousands of tourists who journeys to Philadelphia from another country and never had the luxury of learning English as a second language. A city that very nearby even has multilingual street signs! How dare they! Do yourself a favor and either close down and become a parking lot or maybe find some new management. This is horrendous."
6827,9,1,1,11/25/2013,"Three of us thought it would be fun to conduct a taste test. ˜First we went to Pat's. ˜We ordered a steak and asked them to cut it into three pieces. ˜They complied without hesitation. ˜Then we went to Geno's and made the same request. ˜They said they could only cut it into two pieces. Yeh, well, I can't count past two either. ˜One fucking star. (I preferred Pat's - they didn't leave a bad taste in my mouth.)"
6828,9,2,1,11/25/2013,"Mediocre overprice cheesesteak, cheese fries are good. Stay away from this tourist trap. Go up the street to George's Sandwich Shop. Get a real cheesesteak, with real cheese."
6829,9,1,1,11/25/2013,"I hate this place. Cheesesteak is horrible.. like one of the reviews said, a true philadelphian would not eat here.. The cheesesteak isnt even that good though... The manager is a racist, won't hire anyone that doesn't speak english, it was on the news and radio Only tourist eat here.. GO TO ISHKABIBBLES!! On south street I always tell tourists not to go here when they ask me... I wouldn't recommend this place for anyone..."
6830,9,5,1,11/22/2013,Cool Vibe! Real South Philly Cheesesteaks! This is a fun place with pictures all over the walls of celebrities from the past til now who have been to Gino's!
6831,9,1,1,11/21/2013,"This review is DECADES overdue! There are two groups of people that I hope read this. Tourists who are visiting our city and the directors for Fox Sports. Every time I watch an Eagles game I want to scream from the rafters REAL PHILADELPHIANS DON'T EAT HERE!!!! For reasons that completely escape me, people are led to believe that Philly people frequent this place. It's even mentioned in a few tourist pamphlets that the city puts out. The guy who used to own the place was a blatant racist. ˜The radio spots he'd run were nothing short of hate propaganda and the infamous ""English Only"" sign just screams spend your tourist dollars here. ˜On top of that the food is mediocre ˜at best. So for the love of god dp not patronize this place. Instead send your tourist money to Jim's steaks on South St or just follow the real philly people to Tony Luke's"
6832,9,1,1,11/21/2013,"Philly, Y U no like humans? That's the only reason I can think of why this place exists. We went only because we've heard about the rivalry between Geno and Pat. Husband had tried Pat's before and wasn't impressed, so we decided to test out Geno's. I had the sandwich with provolone, husband had the sandwich with cheez whiz, and we shared the fries with cheez whiz on top. The meat in my sandwich was dry, tasteless, and rubbery and I could barely taste the provolone. Husband's sandwich kept dripping greasy liquid that I guessed was from the cheez whiz. The cheese on the fries had already congealed by the time we brought it over to the table, so it was just a huge clump. Husband and I suffered stomach pains and spent the rest of the night taking turns in the bathroom. I only felt queasy the day after, but husband still had cramps and diarrhea. I assumed it must be the cheez whiz that caused the cramps and diarrhea, because I only ate a few of the fries and I didn't have it as bad. So they either use expired cheez whiz or something of really low quality. Either way, stay far away from this tourist trap. I've never used the words ""cheez whiz"" before so much in my life."
6833,9,4,1,11/20/2013,You can't go wrong with wiz wit and an order of cheese fries! It's a place that anyone living in Philly or visiting Philly should visit at least once.
6834,9,3,1,11/18/2013,I have no idea why people think the cheesesteak is really good there. I went there with my friend who was visiting and heard of the place. Nothing special at all. We wont be back because most places in south jersey they made it better .
6835,9,2,1,11/15/2013,Tried them once and wasn't thrilled. Much better steaks from local pizza joints. Philips and Dan's steaks are FAR better and no BS with the ordering.
6836,9,4,1,11/15/2013,"Cheese Steak challenge. Who's going to win? ˜Geno or Pat? My coworker & I each bought a sandwich from each place. Armed with 1/2 a sandwich from the iconic cheese steak shop, it was time to decide the winner The cheese steak at Geno's was very good. It had a more tender steak & bigger sliced meat. I ordered it with the Whiz. I have to confess, I like Cheez Whiz. Yum!! The winner: GENO's Philly slang to order your cheese steak: Whiz for Cheez whiz (other cheese option are American or Provolone) With or Without = Grilled onions or no onion So if you want a cheese steak w/ Cheez whiz and w/ onion, you say: ""Can I please have a cheese steak whiz with"" lol Don't mess it up or they will give you a hard time (all in fun) Same as at Pat's, they have 2 windows. One for the cheese steak order and one for the beverage. You pay separately for each. They have plenty of picnic tables & chair. Note: Geno's & Pat's are the touristy Philly cheese steak joint. They made the sandwich famous and should be equally recognized for it. Note: if you want a better cheese steak sandwich (per our cabby & others) try Jim's Steak or Tony Luke's. Do your own taste test and decide for yourself. Enjoy!!"
6837,9,2,1,11/14/2013,"Visited for dinner yesterday, and lunch at Pat's. Good portion and nice roll size, but a bit light on the whiz and a little bland, even w/ the onions. ˜Slight edge to Pat's. Cheese fries were decent. ˜Used excess cheese on sandwich."
6838,9,3,1,11/14/2013,I guess it depends on what you are looking for. Personally i am a fan of ishkabibbles on south street.
6839,9,5,1,11/13/2013,It's the classic Philly Cheesesteak! What more can you say. Ya gotta go! I can't decide between here and Pat's they're both damn good and pretty similar. Go to both. You decide!
6840,9,2,1,11/13/2013,"I was here for a couple of hour and had to come to the famous geno's and Pat but at almost $10 a sandwich i was pretty disappointed, it was beefier than Pat's which i liked but no where worth the price. We came here around 5 and there was a pretty big line, longer than pats though it moved fairly fast."
6841,9,3,1,11/13/2013,the energy at the Tourist Trapped corner of Pat's & Geno's is great but unfortunately the sandwiches aren't They are so many better options in and around the city.
6842,9,3,1,11/13/2013,"I think everybody has eaten at Genos at least once. ˜I don't like all the negative reviews I hear about them, because their food is solid. ˜Yes they are overpriced, yes its quick servce, but thats what this place is about; tourists go hear to say they went here and drunk people go here because they could care less. ˜ If i have a choice, I'll go somewhere else but I'll never complain about eating here."
6843,9,3,1,11/12/2013,"So I took the phili cheesesteak challenge and decided to try Geno's and Pat""s both in the same sitting to really see which cheesesteak reigns supreme. ˜Unfortunately Geno's lost the battle. ˜Not as many people have indicated the differences are suttle and you wouldnt really notice unless you ate both at one time. ˜I got the traditional cheesesteak with wiz and onions. Seems like both Pats and Genos uses the same bread company. ˜One place dices the onions while the other slices them. ˜One place slices the steak thiner than the other. ˜One place puts more wiz than the other. ˜What it really came down to for me was the consistency in each and every bite. ˜Just felt that Pats was more uniform. ˜Still both decent sandwiches just felt that Pats was better. Another thing that my have influenced my decision was tht my friend got yelled at by one of the employees. ˜After buying our genos sandwich my friend went to go put ketchup on her half. ˜No big deal. ˜Then when she tried to put ketchup on her half of the pats sandwich all hell broke loose and the employee went ballistic."
6844,9,2,1,11/11/2013,"Food: I ordered an ever so popular cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz. The beef here was leaner and tougher than the ones from their cross street rival. The bread was also very tough. Taste was ok. I mean it's just beef, onion, and cheese. Service: It's the usual... order your cheesesteak at the first window and your drinks at the second one. If you know the process, everything is fine. You get your food in no time and then go find a place to sit. Location: Out of the two places at this street corner, Pat's is better... but not by much. You come to this place just to get it over with and to be able to tell your friends that you've been there. Definitely a tourist trap."
6845,9,1,1,11/10/2013,"My friend Geno, There was a sign in front of your cashier that says, ""you are in America, speak English when you order"". You are damn right about it but read this. Your philly cheese steak sucks. So is the service. Cash only??? No receipt. The meat was of worst quality ever. You charge 6 dollar for fries and soda? I was told if I ever visit Philadelphia, you philly was a must. I am sorry for my bad review but one thing is for sure. It is in English."
6846,9,5,1,11/8/2013,Equally authentic as Pat's! I love it just as much!
6847,9,4,1,11/7/2013,I know it's a tourist trap and I don't like the signs either... but I love love love these cheese steaks and I am not ashamed to yelp it. It's a must have any time I am in Philly.
6848,9,1,1,11/6/2013,"Was 13 miles away at a friend's house when I decided to take a run for a cheesesteak. ˜Did the touristy thing and hit Genos. I totally screwed up the ordering process, but the staff wasn't rude at all. ˜(Didn't see any signs about ordering in English either, but would have shook their hands if I had.). ˜But in the end my steak with onions and provolone wasn't worth the trip. ˜Bread was good and I was happy the meat wasn't that shaved frozen stuff Steak-Uggms. ˜But the short $8.00 thing they handed me wasn't what I would call good. ˜It seemed like a convenience store version of what a cheesesteak is supposed to be. ˜Take heed. ˜The quest for the quintessential steak sandwich continues."
6849,9,2,1,11/6/2013,"Every time someone finds out I am from Philadelphia... I get the question. ""Pat's or Geno's"" My canned answer is neither. See my review for Pagano's. and I go on and on about Pagano's being better and such. I had the pleasure of taking an impromptu trip to Philadelphia from Baltimore at 2 in the morning and unfortunately Pat's and Geno's were the only places that were open at 3:30 when we arrived. I can honestly say that due to the fact that I grew up on the other side of the city it wasn't until I was an adult that I ever ate at Pats' or Geno's. But I digress, I decided to be fair and I got a steak from both Pat's and Geno's and I will attest that I liked the steak from Geno's better. But, that is my opinion. Is this the best in the City though? NOT AT ALL by far. Do yourself a favor and look up Pagano's get yourself a real cheesesteak. Bottom Line: I will not eat here unless I am in a similar situation and my friends and I decide to take a road trip again at 2 in the morning."
6850,9,1,1,11/5/2013,"I am not sure what they did what when this place started but it must have changed. This Philly was hard to take down. ˜Pats has the upper ˜hand, but its not much better. This place is running on reputation.... but you must try it right? Go. Keep them going. It will die sooner or later. No bueno, no good. Oh be sure you speak English because these guys are racist jerks. Some people are a waste of space."
6851,9,1,1,11/3/2013,"The food was mediocre. This place is solely running on reputation, not the taste of the food. You can buy steak-ums and doctor them up with your own fried onions & cheese. Now if you can get past the curt non smiling staff, all the signs telling you not to even bother approaching if you don't speak English and to go back to the s*** country you came from, and the posters blaring kill Mumia Abu-Jamal the cop killer...then give them a whirl. Real American establishment here. Pass. You're not missing anything."
6852,9,1,1,11/3/2013,"Welcome to the land of Transfatia! First I took a look at the crowd that was in line. ˜I counted 30 people out of 37 people, that were overweight. Had no business having a cheese steak sandwich if you ask me. But, hey, this is America. Speaking of which... How disgusting was that ""Speak English"" crap. I'm quite sure they do not want to hear the English words I have in mind for them about it. That's just unnecessary and (thank God), not at reflection of who we are as Americans. The place was filthy. ˜Seems like no one or very few people bother cleaning after themselves (their demographic?), and staff seem too busy ensuring that people speak English so they don't spend time removing leftovers from the benches. Then (surprise!) service was below average. ˜Rude, dismissive people. The sandwich was this overpriced doughy mess with watered down melted cheese. Then there's a decor. ˜The place looks too insisting upon trying to get people's attention. Tacky with that in-your-face showoff diarrhea of stuff around the place, trying to to look like Times Square in the middle of South Philly. ˜Then all that bragging by putting pictures of celebrities or (seemingly) important people having sandwiches... all a big turn off. Feel bad for misguided tourists that see their advertising around the city. If they only knew better."
6853,9,4,1,11/3/2013,"Genos has also tied for my numero uno cheese steak stop in Philly. Located near my old neighborhood, it is a Philly institution. You never know whom you might run in to in line there! This is my type of ˜fast food, just hold the wiz, and dump on the raw onions and hot peppers please!"
6854,9,3,1,11/1/2013,Hundreds of neighborhood cheese steak joints in the city are ˜better than Genos. Geno's and Pat's are for the tourists and political photo ops.
6855,9,2,1,10/31/2013,"Pat's vs Geno's great debate. Not a real fan of cheese-steaks but I went with a bunch of friends when we visited Philly in March earlier this year. I like the bread here better than Pat's but I liked how Pat's meat was chopped. The meat here was more dry as well. In addition, they're pretty rude. I guess they can afford to be. They have a lot of American propaganda with the ""Speak English"" and ""This is America."" That turned me off from this place. I was born in the States and work with immigrants daily, but really?"
6856,9,1,1,10/30/2013,Pats vs. Genos Pats for sure. Genos steaks arent even cut. I feel like I'm chewing on leather. I'm not sure if they use the same bread as Pats or maybe I'm just biased due to their past racial controversy but...it's not good. At all. What.so.ever.
6857,9,1,1,10/29/2013,The worst cheese steak in the city. ˜Never go here.
6858,9,2,1,10/28/2013,i was here over the weekend but i like pat's better - heard that teresea from long island medium was here!
6859,9,2,1,10/28/2013,nothing compared to Pat's!
6860,9,2,1,10/27/2013,"Guy dont use gloves handling my food. ˜Meat was chewy, ˜although it would make decent drunk food."
6861,9,3,1,10/27/2013,"Its not bad, the ribeye kinda tasted bland, the cheese made it flavorful, my buddy gets me Geno's every time he is in town visiting Baltimore, though my personal favorites are Dalessandro's and Tony Luke's when i visit Philly."
6862,9,4,1,10/27/2013,A Philly Original!
6863,9,1,1,10/26/2013,"My first time in Philly, knew I had to try Geno's and Pat's...I don't even understand why there's a competition because Pat's is so superior. My cousin is a born and raised ˜Philly-er, I dont know if that's the proper name for them, but she told me to try Pat's but I wanted to try both. Genos was good but not anything that I couldn't get in New York. Pat's was incredible though! The meat was so fresh and the cheese OH MY GOD THE CHEESEEEEE! I did one traditional and then one cheese mushroom pepper pizza steak, normally I'm all about the toppings but their original was so good I really just couldn't improve upon it. Don't waste your time at Genos, head straight to Pat's!!!!!"
6864,9,4,1,10/26/2013,Great sandwich and cheese fries. ˜Bread is amazing. ˜Will stop there on my next trip. ˜Surprised it has a 2.5 star rating. ˜Deserves better.
6865,9,3,1,10/24/2013,"ive been to both Geno's and Pats... i think Geno's food is okay but the d-bag meter is off the charts as far as the ""English Only"" sign at the window and the huge hummer parked nearby..its a tourist trap plain and simple and the prices reflect it. i prefer Pats...you get your sandwich and you get no overblown BS."
6866,9,2,1,10/24/2013,"Don't waste your time standing in line. You can get better steaks at random restaurants in the same neighborhood. Geno's steaks are sub-par. If you want to wait in line at a ""famous"" steak place you should go to Jim's Steaks instead. At least their steaks are tasty."
6867,9,1,1,10/21/2013,"Simply disappointed! ˜I was looking forward to tasting a true steak sandwich from Philly but this place did not leave a good impression. ˜I was taken back when I found they use Cheese Whiz (oh no, not the Whiz) on their famous sandwiches. ˜Highly overrated! ˜Not worth the trip from New York at all. ˜I must admit the meat was cooked better than Pat's but that's not saying much."
6868,9,5,1,10/20/2013,"We go here consistently every year, its definitely a winner."
6869,9,5,1,10/19/2013,Awesome
6870,9,3,1,10/17/2013,"Seriously good cheesesteaks, long lines though. And bad service. And only outdoor seating. And terrible prices. But... Good?"
6871,9,1,1,10/14/2013,Geno's and Pat's -- Perhaps the worst quality steak you can find in Philly. BUT If you love: -Stomach Pain -Diarrhea -Standing inline with drunk idiots from out of town who don't know any better You will love this place.
6872,9,1,1,10/14/2013,"Well if you really want a cheesesteak in the Italian Market, this is one of two alternatives. ˜Better to hoof it to Center City for numerous better alternatives (Campos, for one)."
6873,9,2,1,10/14/2013,"Growing up in South Philly, 34 years, ˜Geno's steaks were once a great enjoyable sandwich. Now they've gotten cheaper meat which is nothing but fat and charge way too much for a sandwich. They have just become more commercialized. There is nothing special about this sandwich except the name. Sorry Geno's, you're just not the same steak anymore."
6874,9,3,1,10/12/2013,"This place is good-looking and flashy, but if you want better cheese steaks, cross the street at eat at Pat's King of Steaks. We tried both on our trip to Philly, and Pat's is much better, and they have delicious fries."
6875,9,1,1,10/10/2013,"My friend still went to Geno's after I told her not to. So I asked her, ""so was I right?"" Her response, "" You were right"" Nuff said."
6876,9,3,1,10/10/2013,"Cheese fries with Cheese Wiz? Should have gone at midnight instead of noon, drunk instead of sober. They probably would have tasted like 4 stars, but in reality they were much closer to 2.5."
6877,9,4,1,10/7/2013,"Good, not great, Gets 4 stars for the history...."
6878,9,5,1,10/7/2013,"Have not been to Genos in years. Went Saturday night and the place was packed. The place is well let, clean and has plenty of good help. The steaks was fantastic. The ambiance is also the best I have seen. Way better then the dingy looking Pats. The rolls are perfect, the meat was tender and fat free. Great job Genos."
6879,9,1,1,10/7/2013,"I have to take out of town friends here simply because they feel as though it's a necessary stop to their visit to the city. I never minded it so much so I'd take them... it's all been downhill from there. Geno's had rapidly declined so much to the point that I beg my friends to let me take them somewhere else to eat cheesesteaks... The meat is so rubbery, chewy, bland, and dried out.. it's as though you have to get the cheese whiz in order to add some moisture to this desert in your mouth. Bread is stale, service is terrible and the place just looks like a dirty hole where people stupidly stand in line for food to come out of. What a bad way to represent the Philly cheesesteak."
6880,9,1,1,10/7/2013,"Everything about Geno's -- from the service, to their awkward ordering process, to their horrific excuse of a cheesesteak -- makes this one of the worst cheesesteak experiences I've ever had in Philly. I went to undergrad in Philly so trust me, I speak cheesesteak. The locals will tell you (and I agree) that the best cheesesteak shops can be found tucked away in the neighborhoods. To be honest, in my entire four years of college, I never had reason to trek down to Pat's or Geno's. My husband, however, wanted to experience the whole blinking light, mano-a-mano rivalry between Geno's and Pat's. So on our way home after an amazing day trip in Philly, we stopped at Geno's. (We had done Pat's before, and while it wasn't the best I ever had, it was a solid cheesesteak.) For a place that prides itself on being a Philly landmark, you'd think they'd cater to the tourist. Most locals and Philly foodies already avoid this place like the plague. However, Geno's wants the tourist to cater to them. You better learn the rules of ordering before you step to the counter or else you will be shunned. I get that part of the mystique of the place is the rudeness and the whole ""wit or wittout"" lingo, but it's not just a schtick with them. It's really how they are. Beware if you try ordering your fries and drinks from the cheesesteak window. They will yell at you for not knowing or assuming that the window at the far end of the building is where you get your fries and sodas. Now let's talk about what Geno's calls a cheesesteak. They don't chop the meat. It's sliced thick and is very chewy and flavorless. The bread was stale and the fries were rather forgettable. If you find yourself torn Geno's and Pat's, I'd tell you to go across the street to Pat's. They have the better food, and their outdoor decor isn't as fussy and gimmicky as Geno's. If you want the best of the best in Philly cheesesteaks, head down to Tony Luke's on Oregon Ave, or Jim's at 4th and South. I definitely can vouch for Jim's far superior cheesesteak. I spent many a late night and many a work study dollar at Jim's. But back to Geno's. Skip it. Definitely not worth the trip or the hassle to find parking and seating."
6881,9,2,1,10/6/2013,"Not impressed. The meat isn't very good, and the bread was kinda stale. I dont think I would ever eat at this place again. Really underwhelmed with Pats and Geno's."
6882,9,1,1,10/6/2013,"gross! Edit: ˜I should be more specific. ˜ I have been told that the day I went was clearly a bad day; however, the quality was consistent at both Pat's and Geno's. ˜My boyfriend and I went to pick up a cheesesteak from both Pats and Geno's so as to compare. ˜EACH of them was cold!!! ˜the bread was stale and like ripping off a bite of beef Jerky when eating them. ˜The provolone was cold. ˜it was like eating a cold roast beef sandwich with no flavor. ˜Nobody was at either place so i am not sure if we just went on an off day."
6883,9,5,1,10/6/2013,"You definitely can't go wrong with ordering the Wiz Cheesesteak sandwich! It was great!! The down side is that its cash only but there are some ATM's nearby. In my opinion, the place is a bit touristy but it's been open for many decades so that wasn't a shocker. This is definitely a place to try if you're visiting!"
6884,9,4,1,10/5/2013,Definitely gotta hit up Geno's every we come to Philly... Gotta order the philly cheesesteak with onion and cheese wiz :)
6885,9,1,1,10/5/2013,"Vile. Chewy hard steak got stuck in my teeth for hours. Pats is better, but that's like saying being shot in the head is better than being shot in the groin and then shot in the head. Both awful. While I am at it. Every place ever featured on a tv show is a joke now, please don't keep being suckers."
6886,9,1,1,10/5/2013,"I love that the owner died. I really do. He was the one who starred in their borderline racist ""Speak English"" ads. That'll bring the tourist to Philadelphia Geno, well done sir! One day, hopefully, Geno's Steaks dies too - they are cheap on the meat, and the meat, if you get any, tastes and looks very non-cow like. Trivial question: Do you think Geno's distaste for non-English speaking people just stopped at their inability to speak Amerrr'can? Hmmmm, I don't think so...."
6887,9,1,1,10/5/2013,"TOURIST TRAP - Worst cheesesteak I have ever eaten. ˜Boiled beef and onions on a bun, just plain nasty"
6888,9,1,1,10/5/2013,"TOURIST TRAP!!! Please forget everything you have ever seen on a Food Network or Travel Channel TV special. The cheese steaks here are horrible. 1) The meat was thick, hard to chew, and tasteless. 2) I got American instead of Wiz and it was melted onto the bread instead of the meat (and in my opinion that changes the flavor of the sandwich). 3) The onions on top were big pieces that were barely cooked. 4) The bread was too chewy 5) And the price was ridiculous- $9.50! I'm from Jersey and always wanted to try Geno's since it is always raved about but I suggest to try other places. Good alternatives are lot of places on South Street, Tony Luke's and Gaetano's in New Jersey."
6889,9,2,1,10/4/2013,"If you are coming to visit the city and looking for a good cheesesteak....this is NOT your spot. If you want some food after clubbing or being out all night...this is still really not your spot, but it does satisfy if you are drunk and hungry. A plus that some might like is that the meat is very thick. It's not thinly sliced like most cheesesteak places around the area. You know you are getting beef! But it is soooo greasy! Prepare to go home with a heart attack once you are finished! LOL Geno's is a very fast pace spot. You must know what you want upon getting to the window. There's really no asking questions or anything like that. It's pick your cheese then wit or witout. Done!! Oh, and they are pretty expensive too. I don't think they are really worth it!"
6890,9,1,1,10/3/2013,Over rated! Steak meat fatty. Condement area fithy. Employees rude. Tourset trap!
6891,9,1,1,10/3/2013,"If you love your friends, family and your children.. please do not bring them here. Dry sliced beef, chewy roll and a bit overpriced for the quality. I feel sorry for you all who never taste a better cheese steak. Genos or Pat's... get a better cheese steak somewhere else. Or save money and get your cheese steak from your corner Chinese take-out restaurant"
6892,9,1,1,10/2/2013,Pats is the real deal
6893,9,3,1,10/1/2013,"Not bad...just not Pats, but still a good steak."
6894,9,1,1,9/28/2013,"Not impressed. The steak is chewy ,they are stingy with the amount of meat, onions and wiz they put in. Bread is chewy too. It was an ok sandwich and I was starving when I ate it. I noticed after I got my food that they had some really stupid signs up that read ""this is America speak English"". Look at the photos posted by other yelpers, more racism there. Soooo I'll never be going back here again. The cheesesteaks across the street at Pat's ˜look way better for the same price and without the hate & discrimination."
6895,9,2,1,9/27/2013,This ˜place is a landmark in Philadelphia ˜so no matter whether they have 1 Star or 5 stars ˜people will continue traveling out of the way to get one . With that said the thin slices (not chopped) pieces of meat ˜barely fill the bread . The bread is great btw . The workers are arrogant and rude . As if they are doing us a favor by giving us a cheesesteak . Condiments are only available on the ˜side. No thank you .
6896,9,3,1,9/26/2013,"When Pat's is across the street, I see no reason to go to Geno's..."
6897,9,2,1,9/26/2013,"No Philly trip is complete.....yadda yadda yadda.... Come for the experience, I suppose, but the sandwich ˜- wit wiz - is average. ˜Eat here late and drunk like I did. ˜Please, oh please, do not make this your dinner if you are visiting. ˜There are far better places for lunch and dinner than this (e.g. National Mechanics for lunch, Matyson for dinner) if you are in the city. ˜ And for Pete's Sake (or Geno's or Pat's) if you people want a REAL sandwich, go to Jimmy's on Belmont Avenue in good ol' Youngstown, Ohio."
6898,9,3,1,9/26/2013,"Pat's, Geno's, whatever. Pick your poison. Some people side with one versus the other, I really see no difference. They are both average. Tourists who don't know better inevitably wind up here or at Pat's. The drunk crowd does the same. Maybe it's the alcohol. Like Pat's, it's an okay cheese steak. It tastes fine. Now, it's not special. It doesn't represent the best of Philly. I would say Gooey Louie's is my favorite. Jim's, Ishkabibbles, and Tony Lukes are all good as well, but not as special as Gooey Louie's. So, if you really want a good Philly cheese steak, go somewhere else. If you are okay with average and drunk people, Geno's is for you."
6899,9,2,1,9/25/2013,There are much better steaks in Philly....Steve's and Jim's by far better
6900,9,1,1,9/23/2013,"Go to Pat's. This place is not amazing. I also understand you should speak English, but if you are new to the country it is difficult most likely. Having a sign there with american flags and bald eagles saying to Order in English only made me want to bust out my thickest asian accent I can come up with and just F with the worker, but I'm above that. I don't know, I'm American, but my parents are asian. I've been in the US longer than these young kids working there and seeing a sign like that turned me off. I almost walked away, but my friend had already purchased his sandwich. Then we get to the hotel and I come to find out the place is Anti-mumia. Ok i'm never going there again. LOL. I'm a Mumia supporter and if you are against Mumia that is your opinion, but if you feel strongly for the unjust imprisonment of Mumia, why would you go to a place who feels he is a murderer and clearly support the officer? Now I am completely against killing an officer as everyone should be, but I can't support a place where they merely support this man because it's a cop hangout."
6901,9,4,1,9/23/2013,"Soft bread, excellent overall steak and cheese. whiz wit!"
6902,9,1,1,9/22/2013,"While visiting Philly with my girlfriend we decided to get one cheesesteak from Geno's and one from Pat's to share and compare. Geno's, having the longer line, we decided to try first. Upon approaching the ordering window we were faced with inappropriate, racist, political statements sponsored by the founder of Geno's himself. ""This is America, order in English!"" ""I want my country back."" Not only is it offensive, but ignorant as well, as the United States has no official language. While it is an English speaking establishment, and it may be more polite to order in English, they do not have to make such a statement about it. The whole thing made me not want to order from there at all. The most important part, however, is the taste. After picking up a second cheesesteak from Pat's, we sat down across the street and took our first bites. My girlfriend had the Pat's cheesesteak; I had the one from Geno's. Her immediate response was, ""Mmm..."" Mine was, ""eh."" So we traded sandwiches and this bite had flavor. As other reviews had stated, the steak is dry, flavorless, as is the bread itself. Definitely not worth the $9.50 they charge you. The best cheesesteak? I've had better cheesesteaks in Jersey."
6903,9,2,1,9/21/2013,"First of all, the taste was so generic I felt like I could have gotten a better cheesesteak at a Wawa gas station. Secondly they were so incredibly racist, and their signs were so offensive to me (I'm white too, so seriously...) I almost wanted to leave immediately, but I stayed for the hype because I was in Philly, after all. The dudes cursed at my friends and I and we were all pretty pissed by the time we left. Ended up going to Pat's because at least their service was friendly and a lot less offensive. Seriously, just pass this one up. It's not worth your time."
6904,9,2,1,9/21/2013,"Ask yourself the following: Is it 3 am? Are you intoxicated? Do you need to sober up and put something on that rumbling stomach before you drive home? Well if you answered yes to these questions then you find yourself in the right place! Geno's offers the most mediocre steak you can find in the city. The meat is dry, the onions are runny and the cheese wiz is barely distinguishable from the roll. Through Geno's, I've come to learn that great marketing can sometimes make up for a low grade product. Geno's steaks are weeeeeeeak. A great alternative is Steve's Prince of Steaks which opened up recently on 16th and Market in Center City. After that you can drop down a tier to the Jim's cheese steak, which offers a baby cow's worth of meat on each roll. But I digress... You are drunk and you're in South Philly and you're starving... go across the street to Pat's. ""Don't eat a mistake."""
6905,9,1,1,9/21/2013,"If you need to vomit, definately eat here. Both times I ate here I was violently ill afterwards. Its a good thing I spent so much money on it or it wouldnt have been as memorable. go to Jims."
6906,9,3,1,9/19/2013,My friend's from NY wanted to go to Pat's and Gino's to check out their fare. Ordered a cheesesteak from each. Turns out the bread from Pat's is better but the cheesesteak from Gino's is better.. Maybe they shold combine efforts! Both places are reminiscent of a hot dog truck! ˜There is only limited outdoor seating! Cash only and they tell you to be ready to order when it's your turn at the window with cash ready!
6907,9,2,1,9/19/2013,"Hit up Geno's and Pat's at the same time because they're right next to each other. ˜Food wise, Geno's is a bit better because of the bread and the whiz....Pat's cheesesteak looks better but doesn't taste as good. ˜ Additionally, customer service sucks at Genos..the lady that took the orders was very very rude to the customer a couple people ahead of me (so the stereotype is true, just look it up yourself) and bad mouthed him after he left. Overall, they're both overrated and pricey for a cheesesteak and fries."
6908,9,3,1,9/18/2013,i like it but it's no pat's.
6909,9,2,1,9/18/2013,"By all means, go see Geno's and its neighbor Pat's when your in town, however, do everyone a favor and go elsewhere for your cheesesteak. ˜The places are pretty cool to look at and gives a true south philly feel but check out Tony Luke's or JIm's for a better cheesesteak. ˜ I find the meat to be subpar and the bread is just OK. ˜Geno's has decent fries, I'll give them that, but there are much better options all over town. ˜Both Geno's and Pat's are places living off their own legends."
6910,9,1,1,9/17/2013,"I should say it's one thing to be nationalistic, but when its bordering or really, blatenly racist and discriminatory its another. I didn't realize this until my boss and I committed to eating there and we started reading the signs after we paid (him being Moroccan and me being Asian - we kind of were like, uh...I think our kind isn't necessarily wanted here). And the food wasn't great. Bread was too smooshy and the steak drier, not enough wiz either. Go across the street."
6911,9,5,1,9/17/2013,Great steaks!!
6912,9,2,1,9/17/2013,"I'm a Philly chick born and bred, so I know better. ˜But, I was squiring friends from England around town, and of course they wanted to do the pat's/Geno's show down, so who was I to deny them. ˜ Well, what can I say that hasn't already been said? The people here are quite rude, but I know that's their schtick. ˜But in my opinion they are doing nothing to improve the overall opinion of Philadelphia. ˜The older lady in particular is a real bitch...she needs a nice long vacation or something. The cheesesteaks here are nothing special. ˜I actually prefer Pat's if I have to choose between those two."
6913,9,3,1,9/17/2013,"We walked over to Geno's after having Pat's, just because we could. Following the ""when in Rome, do as Roman's do"" credo - we wanted to compare Geno's right after we had Pat's. I will have to duck after saying this, but I liked Pat's a little better. I did like the way that Geno's steaks didn't chop up the steak too much, so that's one small difference between the two legends of cheese and steak. I know that this is a very touchy subject around these parts, so I'm just saying what I think. Having said that though - you really should come down to this street and try it for yourself. While I think it's splitting hairs compared to others, this is a really good cheesesteak!"
6914,9,1,1,9/16/2013,"Bad attitudes, over rated food."
6915,9,3,1,9/14/2013,"When you come to Philly, I think it's a state law (hah) that you have to have a cheesesteak at Geno's (and Pat's for comparison. The service here was quite a bit friendlier than Pat's, but it pays to know what you want BEFORE you get up to the ordering window. Like Pat's, they want your order as soon as you step up, but they aren't as rude when they tell you to step aside to read the menu while they help the next person in line. I enjoyed Geno's much more than Pat's, as the bread wasn't hard, filling portion more generous, and at least in my opinion the steak had a better flavor. The hubby preferred Pat's. Service is very fast, most of the seating is outside, and it's not really a place to linger over your meal. If you've never been to Philly, then this is one stop you really should make. Get one from here, one from Pat's, split each sandwich between you and another person or two and have your own taste test. Like seeing the Rocky steps and statue, coming here is just one more thing to cross off your Philly bucket list."
6916,9,4,1,9/13/2013,"I'm personally a Pat's fan, but it's a cheesesteak so of course it's good! Pro tip: Know your order and have cash at the ready."
6917,9,2,1,9/12/2013,"Any place in Philly with a cheese steak will do, they are not even close to the only, and there are more good than bad places out here. Good: Canned cheese wiz makes everything better. The bread is actually pretty fresh. Bad: Value, your just paying for hype. You really cant go wrong with Cheese wiz, steak and fries.... so nothing is new here. Late night stops here always leave me in worse shape in the stomach (and only at this time), go elsewhere if you have the 2am munchies. The attitude towards the ""English"" is just poor customer service for a greedy impatient shop, in fact their English is flawed too."
6918,9,4,1,9/10/2013,"Visiting my brother out near Philly, so he, my dad and I decided to stop by and try it. The ordering pace is pretty fast so know what you want and have you CASH ready. I got a cheesesteak ""wit"", meaning with onions. The bread was good and chewy, how I like. That's perhaps a personal preference. The meat was good and salty. Cheese wiz is tasty and I'll put onions on darn near anything. I thought the sandwich was delicious, but I don't have a picky pallet. The service was hurried, but I guess that's part of the charm is it's supposed to be a sandwich shop you can grab and go. I think people may mistake that for rude. The seating is all outside. Price was about 12 bucks for sandwich, fries and drink. Which is steep, but not unusual for a typical tourist eatery."
6919,9,4,1,9/9/2013,"I have had cheesesteaks that were equal to or better than Gino's, but their hot sauce cannot be found anywhere else, so I have to give Gino's 4 stars, and probably my favorite place to go when craving a steak sandwich. On the negative side, the people working there make you feel as though it's a privilege for you to eat there, not theirs for having you as a customer. Not cool. Also, a bit pricey; they don't need to be that expensive."
6920,9,1,1,9/9/2013,"save your money - This is probably the worst sandwich I have ever had. They barely give you any meat and they didn't even melt the cheese into the sandwich! seriously, you would be better off at steak and shake."
6921,9,3,1,9/8/2013,"Well after I headed to Pat's I decided to try Geno's. the line was longer and there were some rude teens cursing at each other the whole time. But after the ignorant teens , I got my cheesesteak. I really liked it , the bread had a crisp taste to it. The only thing I did not like and I was kind of shocked when I saw the sign that states ""Speak English"" I think they put that up because if you look around the neighborhood it is a lot of Asians and latinos."
6922,9,2,1,9/8/2013,"I've been here twice, and neither time was I overly impressed with the sandwiches. The service is what I'd expect for this kind of place - gruff, fast paced, and generally unfriendly. They don't like explaining how they do things. You order ONLY your sandwich at the first window (ALL they care about is how many sandwiches, what kind of cheese - american, cheese whiz or provolone - and if you want onions). You pay for your sandwich there. You wait for your sandwich, and then you move down to the second window where you can order drinks and fries. For two sandwiches, 1 order of fries and two waters, it was $29. I realize it's a Philadelphia staple, but for the quality of meat (which is a step below Steak-Ums), it's overpriced. I get better cheesesteaks in NYC, at a Philadelphia-native owned bar. It's fun to go once, but I don't know that I'd go again. Had I read the reviews about how racist they were, I wouldn't have gone at all. I'm shocked that I didn't noticed any of those signs when I was there."
6923,9,3,1,9/8/2013,"when the meat isnt dry, its banger... when they have mushrooms, its banger... otherwise it sucks... overall i feel the same way about genos as i do about pats.. overrated. philly cheesesteak is supposed to be famous... and yeah its pretty damn good... when it wants to be. ˜ive had genos and pats so many times and its either hit or miss. ˜i think out of the 1000x ive went, ive had about 50 good steaks and 950 avg ones. ˜still, when youre drunk at 3am in philly, nothings better than a cheesesteak."
6924,9,1,1,9/7/2013,"Geno's steaks was a huge letdown. With all the big lights and overdone signs I expected the food to really stand out. Unfortunately, all the fanfare must be to help distract customers from stale bread, a couple pieces of mildly warm steak, and a small amount of whiz. Don't waste your time. This place is all about the hype. It does not live up to expectations."
6925,9,1,1,9/6/2013,"I personally will not be returning to Geno's at anytime. ˜Between horrible customer service and lack of a good philly cheesesteak, Geno's just was a total miss for me. ˜ First off, it's cash only. ˜Which is fine as long as you don't wait in a long line just to reach the (rude) cashier where the little sign tells you. ˜The poor gentleman in line behind me was sent away by a rude cashier that obviously has had this happen plenty of times. ˜(Hint: maybe there should be a larger sign somewhere.) ˜I also thought the lady selling the drinks was rude too. They don't have green peppers or mushrooms, their onions aren't cooked and the meat just wasn't good. I definitely wouldn't recommend bothering with Geno's. ˜Period."
6926,9,3,1,9/5/2013,This place is Ok for a late night sandwich after some cocktails. Right down the road a little is Tony Lukes which is much better.
6927,9,1,1,9/5/2013,"Whatever you do, DO NOT GO HERE. These people are racist who straight up tell you that if you don't speak English you are not welcome to order at their counter. in fact, there is a sign right there as you are getting ready to pay that they ""want to take back their country"" DISGUSTING. If you want to support racist idiots who are BIGOTS go for it. the cheese steak SUCKED by the way.limp and flavorless. GO TO PATS."
6928,9,3,1,9/5/2013,oI always feel rushed there. There steaks are ALRIGHT. not worth the hype. I'd go back t Genos if Pats line was out the streets
6929,9,4,1,9/5/2013,"Not necessarily the best, but no complaints!"
6930,9,3,1,9/4/2013,Solid. Not much more to say.
6931,9,1,1,9/4/2013,............racists...
6932,9,4,1,9/4/2013,It's not as good as Jim's but good enough to be famous.
6933,9,3,1,9/1/2013,"CASH ONLY! Be prepared. The kitchen staff is really nice, but the counter workers can be rude. Food is quick to order and fast to receive, unlike the long line. $9.50 for a (cheese? I didn't taste the cheese, they be skimpin) steak sub. $5 for the cheese fries which were delicious! $4 for the freedom fries. Cheesesteak was bland and i had to add a lot of condiments for more flavor. Would only come back for the cheese fries. Tables were clean and tidy though. In all honesty, I wanted to go to Pats..."
6934,9,4,1,8/31/2013,"I used to denigrate Geno's, buying into this ""tourist trap"" argument, but the truth is that Jim's, Pat's and Geno's are all tourist traps. ˜Another argument -- Geno's is a rip-off. ˜Yes, true, but all three are rip offs. ˜I enjoy the thicker cut of Geno's to the odor-of-death ambience of Jim's and the overcooked steak scraps of Pat's. ˜Plus, Pat's is a shithole, decor-wise. ˜Not expecting the Ritz, but c'mon, they must be gazillionaires; trying putting some money into the place."
6935,9,2,1,8/30/2013,"It's a must-experience kind of place, but the cheesesteak quality is quite sub par"
6936,9,2,1,8/30/2013,Let's face it. ˜You're not here for the cheesesteak. ˜You're here because you saw some special on TV about amazing cheesesteaks in Philadelphia and the presented contention between Pat's and Geno's piqued your interest. ˜Know this: ˜Pat's (right on the opposing corner) is [slightly] better. ˜Also know that there are a hundred other places in which to get a cheesesteak that's better than either of these.
6937,9,4,1,8/29/2013,Neither one (Pats/Genos) is perfect (for my favorite steak in Philly I choose Jims) but if I'm in the area and have to choose I choose Geno's. They are cleaner and they have better meat.
6938,9,2,1,8/29/2013,"More pomp than anything. ˜Deuchey owner (deceased). ˜If I want a ""fast food"" cheesesteak, I'll stick to Pat's."
6939,9,5,1,8/28/2013,This Place is the Best! It has the Best Philly Chesesteaks I've ever had. No Visit to Philly is complete without visiting Geno's!!! ;)
6940,9,4,1,8/27/2013,"I just noticed I never wrote a review for Geno's when I was in Philly in April... ˜I don't know how I missed this one! I did the touristy thing in Philly... a cheese steak from Pats... and a cheese steak from Geno's. Side by side... ready... go. I realize this is a touchy subject in this area... when you like your cheese steak... you LOVE your cheese steak... and I think I like Geno's better. I'm ready for the hate mail... Pat's is good. ˜Don't get me wrong. ˜It's better than anything I would get in Northern Virginia ˜- pretending to be a sub... but I like the meat, and the bread better at Geno's. As far as most of the complaints about the rude staff.... I was at the window a total of about 3 seconds... wiz wit... and onward. ˜I didn't have a chance for them to be nasty... but I can't say they went out of the way to be nice."
6941,9,4,1,8/27/2013,"Best cheese steak! I prefer this place over Pats any day. I ordered a ""whiz, witout"", which means cheese whiz without onions. The bread is a little crunchier and the whiz is nice and cheesy! Even with a huge line this place is quick. Eating here is like eating a piece of history. Ben Franklin would be proud."
6942,9,2,1,8/27/2013,"Pat's is better (I'm no fanboy). The bread was fantastic, but the sandwich itself was lacking. I am glad I tried it, but it was very overrated. Their pork is terrible too. I will NEVER go to here or Pat's again. I can get a better cheesesteak in Florida."
6943,9,4,1,8/25/2013,I usually like Pat's better than Geno's bc Pat's is greasier. ˜If I'm watching my diet I go with Geno's but if I'm watching my diet I shouldn't be in this area of town now should I? ˜lol. ˜If you are new to Philly order one from both places and decide which one is better for yourself!
6944,9,3,1,8/25/2013,"Similarly to Pats, you come here because it's a landmark. Geno's is also not the best cheesesteak in Philly. The two restaurants are destination spots and are worth seeing once. I would recommend getting one cheesesteak from Pats, and one cheesesteak at Ginos and splitting them both with a friend. That way, you can say that you've tried both, check it off the list, and move on to better cheesesteaks in the city."
6945,9,3,1,8/23/2013,"The experience is what counts, not the food. Mediocre steaks, but there's nothing like it anywhere. Except across the street. Where there's something exactly like it."
6946,9,3,1,8/23/2013,It's hard to give a 3 star review when these cheesesteaks are the greatest sandwiches EVER! I literally fly in once a year for these. The people are sooooooo rude. I've never seen such rudeness in a place of buries ness in my life but I pretty much let it be just to eat the best
6947,9,5,1,8/23/2013,"Delicious! A little out of the way to get here, but definitely a good try :)"
6948,9,1,1,8/22/2013,"Read my review for Pats. Same thing applies here, the steaks are gross"
6949,9,1,1,8/22/2013,"It was pretty much the same as Pat's except I didn't get the ""soup nazi"" treatment. Won't be going to either again unless one of my tourist friends really really really want to go there. But I'll do my best to convince them that Philly has more to offer than Pat and Geno's."
6950,9,1,1,8/19/2013,"Ignorant, racist scumbags that make a half-assed steak and do almost as much to denigrate the image of Philadelphia as the asshole sports fans... I can't believe the goofy, schlocky appeal hasn't worn off for people yet...maybe the tourists haven't ever seen the Geno's cooks come out and gang-beat a Pat's customer before...like a lot of locals have. I myself have seen this everal times while eating at La Lupe 50 feet away. The only silver lining is that they actively manipulate the Deleware Ave wannabe-guido nightclub-tourists into shelling out $8.50 for a terrible steak. Tony Luke's or Delassandro's have far better steaks. Screw both of those festering neon distractions. They are a psychic tumor on the city."
6951,9,3,1,8/18/2013,"No mushrooms, no peppers, lower quality meat, but sharper, better whiz than Pats. ˜Not really sure how they can compete. ˜Same price, same location, and same hours. ˜Not bad, but nothing special."
6952,9,5,1,8/18/2013,Best steak in town - it's all I want when I am traveling to Philly. Wiz on the steak and Wiz on the fries. #1 in Philly. Hands down!
6953,9,3,1,8/18/2013,"Came on a sunny Saturday afternoon at 2PM, and the line was still piling on to the street, and so we chose Geno's over Pat's precisely for this reason (long lines = more popular, no?). Plus, they are efficient and the cheese steak line moves fast. This was my first Philly cheese steak experience since moving to Philadelphia, and I knew I would have to try the cheese steak with the cheese whiz. To sound like a local, you would order a ""wiz wit"", essentially, a cheese whiz cheese steak with grilled onions. The cheese steak itself was so-so. Tasty (mostly because of the whiz) during consumption, it leaves you with a full stomach and potentially clogged arteries after. Myopic behavior. The steak itself was too tough and much too greasy. My favorite part would probably have to be the bread - just the right amount of chew for a sandwich like this. We also ordered fries with cheese whiz on the side. Drinks and fries are a separate line, which took much longer than the actual cheese steak line. The cheese whiz quickly became congealed, and served as a constant reminder of what was happening with the cheese whiz that we'd just consumed in our bodies at that very moment. All-in-all, this is an experience not to be missed. I'll be back again soon to try out Pat's."
6954,9,3,1,8/17/2013,"Not bad, probably one of the better cheesesteak places out of the most well known three."
6955,9,3,1,8/16/2013,"Descriptive phrase: gaudy cheesesteak joint. It's fluorescent orange, you're not going to miss it. Geno's is one half of the historic rivalry with Pat's across the street. $9.50 for a Whiz wit (that's a cheesesteak with Cheese Whiz and onions, for you noobies). Expensive, but it is about a foot long. Long strips of steak on a fresh Italian-bread hoagie. Plenty of cheese and onions. I ate it while walking around the park and neighborhood. I thought it was pretty tasty, but more of a drunk-food. Geno's isn't gonna win any awards, but it gets the job done. And, it's an institution."
6956,9,1,1,8/15/2013,"Yes yelp, I have been here, and I don't like it so stop pressuring me to review it! I don't like Geno's. Why? Because the meat is fatty and is in big chunks instead of chopped up. I hate that when I walk past this place to get to work, I have to manuever around all the cars that are illegally parked in the walk ways. I hate that I really can't drive past this place because the lines reach out into the street and tourists don't quite seem to get that they are standing in a city street. I hate the neon lights. I hate how much they charge. I hate their cheesesteaks. I like that there are napkins available outside so I can grab one on my way to work when it's cold out and I need to wipe my nose."
6957,9,3,1,8/15/2013,"So I was really disappointed with Pats and was praying that Geno's salvaged my Philly cheesesteak experience. ˜Geno's steak was way better than Pat's. It was juicy, thicker, and seasoned. ˜However, with the cheese whiz, it made the steak a little salty. ˜It still wasn't as good as most people rant and rave about. ˜I can honestly get a better cheesesteak in NYC. ˜So out of Pat's and Geno's, Geno's wins. ˜But if you can get a cheesesteak in the city center, don't bother making the trip, it's not worth it."
6958,9,4,1,8/13/2013,Good Stuff but its a definitely a tourist cheese steak
6959,9,3,1,8/13/2013,"I have been eating here for a really long time. And I have changed my allegiance between Pat's and Geno's probably 5 times. Unfortunately, it is because they can be inconsistent. Not from order to order, but from month to month. Sometimes Geno's steak is tender and juicy, sometimes it is fatty and dry. This is certainly not the best steak in the city and it is kind of a touristy spot, but I don't understand all the Philadelphians saying it is garbage or not even average. An average cheesesteak is one you get at a pizza place. This is better. And yes, my review of Pat's is very similar to this, because they really are very similar. The prices are ridiculous now (close to $10!), but I admit it is still a guilty pleasure. A sloppy wiz wit' at 3 am after a night of drinks is tough to beat."
6960,9,1,1,8/12/2013,"Of the two, I prefer Pat's to Geno's. ˜There are many reasons for this choice, but here are a few. 1) Meat seems tougher and not as warm as other places. 2) Ambiance is a bit too much to stomach with all that orange. 3) Staff isn't as friendly. I'm not a fan of price, but Pat's is the same so whatever. If you want to avoid touristy places, check out any number of places featured here. ˜One of my favorites is Gooey Louie's."
6961,9,4,1,8/11/2013,"I love going here after a concert or a ball game in the city. I've heard the staff can have an attitude, but I have yet to experience that. Tasty cheesesteaks from Gino's are the perfect late night meal!"
6962,9,3,1,8/10/2013,"Con Whiz Por Favor! Second stop of the day for cheeseteaks and even though the reviews were bad and there is a rumour that they are racist, we did want to give it a try and we were not disappointed. This time we chose a cheesesteak with onions and cheez whiz and it was very good. The bread was tasty, the meat was not as chopped up but more in thin slices (which was a nice change), and the onions were good (but not as good as Pat's). Only thing though was that the Whiz made this sandwich a bit watery and messy. Still very good, but next time I would go with American or Provolone instead. Yum!"
6963,9,1,1,8/9/2013,"With the impressive display I was expecting an extremely delicious sandwich. Instead, I ended up calling the whole thing overrated. My sandwich was bland, and the service so-so. I heard that friends who went across the way to Pat's had a better experience, which is saying a lot since Geno's has the more attractive display. Hate to say I found much to be desire at this one. Oh well, hopefully better luck next time."
6964,9,3,1,8/9/2013,"I can't really speak to the xenophobia accusations, I had a perfectly good interaction in terms of service personally. On the sandwich side of things, I guess I rate this place a 3.5. ˜It has a pretty different style steak than Pat's, but overall I prefer Pat's better and if I'm gonna make the trek out here I probably would return to Geno's because of this. ˜I'm glad that I can say I've tried both of these famous joints though. The meat is in thicker, fuller slices unlike Pat's style, which is thiner, smaller chopped up meat. ˜This unfortunately leads to the meat being dryer. ˜I prefer Pat's because it's juicier and tender. ˜Bread and onions were good though. ˜I tried American when I was here, but I have since become a whiz convert so maybe I'll come again to try a whiz with."
6965,9,5,1,8/9/2013,geno the owner is fantastic! he is not a nazi and he's a great tipper! learn how to order your cheesesteaks before you come in!!!!!! they move fast... that's their tradition!!!!! give them some love!!!!!
6966,9,2,1,8/7/2013,"There is so much better in South Philadelphia. ˜Geno's is simply established and its competition with Pat's makes it a destination for out of towners and others who appreciate it. ˜If you love a good cheese steak this in not the place to go. ˜Personally, I also find their ˜English-only ordering policy, ""This Is AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING `SPEAK ENGLISH.""' intolerant, especially as they are located in an immigrant neighborhood."
6967,9,2,1,8/7/2013,"Overrated, over priced tourist trap!! ˜The food is ok at best."
6968,9,1,1,8/6/2013,I've have better cheesesteaks in suburban Boston. How disappointing. BTW this is the 21st century: take credit cards!
6969,9,4,1,8/4/2013,Oh come on. Most of the 1 and 2 star reviews are a little harsh. Its 3.5 star food and a bonus .5 for the 'check-the-box'.
6970,9,3,1,8/2/2013,I still prefer their steaks over Pat's for several reasons. Pieces of steak as opposed to chopped up steak sitting on a grill and one of the cleanest restaurants you will find. Not as tasty as I remember it from years ago but still the place I take out-of-towners when they want the South Philly experience. Then of couse I tell them Chinks/Joe's is the best.
6971,9,2,1,8/2/2013,Not a fan. I like my steak chopped up and with condiments on them when i go to sit down and eat.
6972,9,3,1,8/1/2013,"It's and OK place. Cheesesteak sandwichs are good but a bit on the oil side. More a Tourist Trap and Kitsch type of a joint but still a fun place to visit. (the place is lit up with neon like a Las Vegas Casino) Here's what I suggest. Buy a classic Cheesesteak sandwich or two from BOTH Geno's and Pats just down the block behind you and take both of them home to the wife and kids. Cut them into 3"" bite-size pieces and have them on a Friday or Saturday night for dinner while watching the Phillies, the Flyers or the Eagles. I've found in my wife and son like Pat's while I and my daughter preffer Geno's. This way everyone is happy. Enjoy!"
6973,9,1,1,8/1/2013,"Gross food. Gross people. Gross attitude. I wouldn't feed that ""Philly"" to a trash can. I wish I could have thrown it in the Skinny-Pete-wannabe's face. And the kid with the bowl cut (cool, bro) at the fry window was too busy screaming at a suspected hot pepper thief (gasp) to get our order in. Just to clarify, she had indeed purchased a Philly from Geno's, but had taken it out of the wrapper already. Our first and HOPE TO GOD ONLY visit to the laughably self proclaimed ""city of brotherly love"" was miserable all-around, with Geno's being the ultimate low. The only time I've ever wanted to cry while ordering food. Good riddance."
6974,9,1,1,8/1/2013,ew gross. jims on south.
6975,9,3,1,8/1/2013,Always come here for a cheesesteak since it's the famous place to go. ˜Quick service and always a pleasure to deal with the guys here. ˜Next time I'm around I may need to try a more local less touristy place to compare but overall I always enjoy my food from them.
6976,9,1,1,8/1/2013,"This place is a tourist trap! I took my brother and sister here for a ""taste of Philly"". We got two cheeses steaks with onions and provolone, (note I am saying this wrong and if I ordered it this way id probably be refused service) with cheese fries. All Of this cost 24 dollars. After biting into the ""steak"" I thought I was eating leather. The meat, or so they call it, has zero flavor and was tough. The onions were not cooked and seemed to come from a bag, not fresh at all. The fries were the saving grace of this meal although they tasted like they came from McDonalds. If you wanna pay for terrible food, go here, but there are many other places in Philly, such as reading terminal or Jimmy's Steaks on south street, that have a tourist appeal and actually serve edible food! How disappointing!!"
6977,9,3,1,7/31/2013,"Personally, I liked my first time at Geno's. ˜Not overly flavored or spiced, just simple ingredients. ˜Food ain't political, it's either good or it's not. ˜This is good food! ˜Now. ˜Let's keep eating. ˜Lot of city to go! ˜LOL"
6978,9,2,1,7/31/2013,"Obviously if you have made a trip to Philly and not eaten a ""real"" Philly Cheese Steak, going to a place like Geno's is almost considered a rite of passage. It was a fun experience, but it wasn't anything magical or mouth watering. The woman who takes the orders was very impatient with people who didn't know the ""ordering protocol."" I particularly felt uncomfortable when she tried to rush 2 tourists whose accents were Eastern European. I get the whole ""We live in America"" vibe, but being rude to customers is never a good idea if you intend on keeping them. As far as the cheese steak, I ordered ""One American wit"" or American with onions. It had too many onions for my taste, so I took half of them off. The cheese and steak tasted good, but nothing exceptional. I think my cousin put it best when he explained that the reason people enjoy it so much is the grease and flavors that have been absorbed into the grill for so many years that it would make anything taste good. In short, I am glad I tried it to say I've been there, but will definitely go somewhere else next time I want a cheese steak."
6979,9,5,1,7/31/2013,"great , first time ever , came from puerto rico and did the taste test , both genos and pat have their unique style and both taste awesome"
6980,9,1,1,7/30/2013,"tourist trap, tastes like you're eating rubber on a bun"
6981,9,2,1,7/29/2013,"Geno's is nothing more than a walk up window, but it's a colorful place to say the least. During our short visit, we saw a variety of tourists, locals, and biker dudes. We approached the window and were asked (not in the most pleasant way) what we wanted. There are three options for cheese - American, Cheese Whiz, and Provolone. He told us Whiz was the most popular, but American was the traditional. P and I decided to get one of each. To read the rest of my review and see pictures, check out my blog - City Lights & Tasty Bites citylightsandtastybites.?"
6982,9,2,1,7/28/2013,"We tried this place out just to compare to Pat's (across the street ""original"" cheesesteak place). Similar crazy pricing (cash only too). Compared to Pat's the steak was definitely much better. The fries were not as good, nor the bun. Oh well. Hopefully if you are visiting Philadelphia, then you are doing it for another reason. Cause if it is for the cheesesteaks...at least here and Pat's, we found it to be a big dissapointment. We can get better cheesesteaks in Denver!"
6983,9,2,1,7/27/2013,Not a fan of Genos or Pat's. They were both either rubbery or dry and the amt of stk used is very little.
6984,9,2,1,7/27/2013,"I've been to all the heavyweights that Philly has to offer in the steak sandwich market. ˜Geno's ranks near the bottom among them. ˜Apart from its curbside tourist appeal and experiencing a side-by-side comparison with the rival Pat's, my advice is to skip this mediocre steak and indulge in some Jim's or Dalessandro's."
6985,9,1,1,7/26/2013,"I ordered online from grubhub and when I went to pay for my food they tried to charge me an extra $1.08 from the price I had on the website. After showing the manager that the tax was included and refusing to pay extra he still ended up with .32 cents and said we would call it even. My salad was dry and old, my garlic bread was garlic crust, there was no bread to it. I had to close my eyes and imagine garlic to even taste it. My first experience I asked if I could substitute onions for another toppings. The response was sure and at the end of the meal is when I found out I was charged $3.00 for the topping. I thought substitute meant an equal exchange. I ordered 2 groupons and both experiences were not good. This has taught me a lesson about buying more than 1 groupon at a time. There is a reason they are selling them as in lack of business. The place was empty on a Saturday afternoon. If you go here check your bill. There was one positive, they were nice, while that is great, I would prefer good food."
6986,9,2,1,7/26/2013,Hit Pat's across the street. Geno's is all flash... 2 best words to describe this place: Tourist attraction.
6987,9,1,1,7/26/2013,"I've gotten better cheesesteaks at Jersey Mikes. ˜Even as a tourist (I'm new to Philly; from the South), this is disgusting. Generic, bland, possibly stale bread, dry chopped bland steak, and for what you get it is way over-priced."
6988,9,1,1,7/26/2013,"The so-called ""food"" they serve here is hospital food quality. ˜I don't understand how this place (as well as the other place across the street from it) stays in business, when there so many GENUINE cheese steak places in Philly. For a proper cheese steak, you are much better off going to Pastificio's or, even better, Steaks N Shakes, where the prices are very reasonable without cutting back on quality of ingredients. Basically, Geno's is an incredibly over rated tourist trap."
6989,9,5,1,7/26/2013,"A Philly icon, what else to say? ˜A true taste of ""The Philadelphia Cheesesteak"". ˜ If you can get through fluorescent-light attack on your soul, endless wall of celebrity/employee photos, strict and succinct ordering process, then you are rewarded with a thing of pure unadulterated greasy beauty, the Cheesesteak! ˜ ˜As a personal fan of the steak sheets or slabs of meat, rather then the chopped up and shredded kind of cheesesteak serving method you may find in a generic food court faux-steak, Geno's steps up to bat with an MVP in the late-night artery-clogging games. ˜Geno's vs Pat's, the rival of the century in South Philly. ˜Everyone has there preference, and while your group of friends may split up on Passyunk Ave and choose to pray upon their respective altars of the greasy-god, know that your both shortening your life-span together. ˜But oh, what a way to go!"
6990,9,1,1,7/25/2013,Late night drunk food. Fights in line while waiting? No Thanks! The steaks aren't that great either.
6991,9,1,1,7/25/2013,"Worst steaks in Philly. Save your money, save your waste-line, and try eating from a real cheesesteak place."
6992,9,1,1,7/25/2013,"I've unfortunately stopped here several times at the insistence of friends visiting from out of town and have never had a cheesesteak that didn't immediately cause my stomach to rebel against me. I'm sure they've got some good things going for them, but the stringy meat and gaudy signage are enough that I would not voluntarily eat here. If you're in this neighborhood and can live without a cheesesteak, check out the nearby Rim Cafe: it's not at all similar to this fare since it's a chocolate shop, but the owner is unbelievably hospitable and borderline insane (in the best way possible)."
6993,9,1,1,7/24/2013,I wish this place would just shut down and save electricity.
6994,9,2,1,7/24/2013,"pat's is better, and i only give pat's 3 stars"
6995,9,1,1,7/23/2013,"The guy behind the counter is clearly exercising his psychic powers because when I walked up he just stared at me, obviously, to see if I was a telepath as well. ˜I'm sure in his mind he had given me a warm welcome and asked me what I'd like to order. ˜Unfortunately, I'm not a telepath so this came off as rude which is probably so far from the truth. ˜After I placed my order for 5 cheese steaks, I watched a guy take meat WITH HIS UNGLOVED HANDS and drop it onto the griddle. At that point, certain of rhinovirus or some other pathogen, he scooped it up with a spatula as he held the roll with the other hand. ˜In his defense, the roll-hand wasn't the one he used for meat--just the one he used to rub his face. ˜The food didn't get me sick so I guess, that's where the one star really shines. ˜By the way, the place across the street--worse."
6996,9,5,1,7/22/2013,awesome
6997,9,2,1,7/21/2013,"I am a Pat's girl...sorry, folks :) The steak is too thick and it looks like the steak you get of out of the freezer."
6998,9,1,1,7/19/2013,"This place only survives because of tourists. No locals in their right mind would eat here or at the competitors across the street. The only item that is actually edible are the cheese fries with melted American, but I still wouldn't wait in line for them. The service is rude and rushed, steaks are overpriced, meat is cold, cheese not melted, rolls soggy, outside condiments are unsanitary and completely nauseating... I could go on, but you should get the point by now. Go to John's Roast Pork, Tony Luke's, Chink's (now known as Joe's) in the NE, Gooey Louie's, pretty much anywhere but here. I know the bright lights can be mesmerizing, but as always, go AWAY from the light!"
6999,9,3,1,7/19/2013,"When you've had the best steak & cheese, everything else is just normal. Pretty cool how they use cheese whiz, melts fast. The taste wasn't anything extraorDinary but it was good. If I'm in Philly soon I'll see myself here again."
7000,9,1,1,7/16/2013,"I avoided this place like the plague, but I just had to check it out when a friend was visiting because of god knows why. I'm going to go back to avoiding this place like the plague. It's crap. don't go here. Yes, I'm going to use this same review for the place across the street, because they both suck."
7001,9,1,1,7/14/2013,"The cheesesteak was not good, rather dry and flavorless. The business is also pretty racist and goes beyond patriotism to something quite offensive. Not worth waiting in line for, and there's not much space to enjoy your food once you've gotten it."
7002,9,1,1,7/12/2013,"This place survives because of its name, not its awful food or racist business practices Food: 1/5 Service: 1/5 Atmosphere: 1/5 Parking: 1/5 Cleanliness: 1/5 ˜ ˜ Geno's will receive the worst review I have made on yelp to date. Absolutely dreadful. ˜ ˜Philadelphia is certainly not famous for being a ""clean"" city and the surrounding neighborhood of this restaurant is testament to this fact, almost third world actually. However, this famous Philly restaurant surely does NOT live up to its name. ˜ ˜To begin, the whole restaurant is surrounded by bumper stickers saying ""speak English to order"" or ""Press 1 to speak English, press 2 to get deported"" Wow, way to live in the legal gray area we call being a rude, bigoted business owner. Not to mention the outdoor area was absolutely filthy with trash literally in the streets, dirty unwiped tables, the whole nine. Looking indoors, the food prep area looks aged, dirty, and overall unsanitary. ˜ Service is rushed, rude, and very gruff. Perhaps coming from the suit-and-tie culture of DC and landing in the blue collar world of Philly is the real culture shock for me but more likely, the employees here just behave rudely and rush people through. ˜Parking is non-existent, good luck. Otherwise, I've had better cheesesteaks at diners in rural Virginia...I'd rather eat at subway in fact. Maybe I'll order in Spanish just to spite this terrible restaurant we call Geno's."
7003,9,1,1,7/11/2013,Gross... its a tourist attraction. But they do not make good cheeseteaks.
7004,9,3,1,7/10/2013,"My friend and I ordered a Wiz Wit from both here and their neighbor Pats when visiting Philly from NYC. It was a great cheesesteak, but I gotta say I liked Pats better. I gotta say this place has the stand-out personality though. Bright orange colors and motorcycles everywhere. While ordering some guy at the window yells ""hey that's a pats steak you cant put that on here"". He somehow caught a guy through a line of customers loading up his pat's steak with peppers. Classic."
7005,9,2,1,7/10/2013,"This may be the birthplace of the cheesesteak, but the food is pretty mediocre. For $9.50, you get a sizeable sandwich with/without onions, and your choice of cheese. The bread was chewy, and the onions tasted like they were boiled and had no taste whatsoever. It may be a (rather gaudy) food landmark, but the food isn't anything to write home about. You can honestly get a better cheesesteak anywhere else in the city"
7006,9,2,1,7/9/2013,"Sadly, this place was a let down. Took a detour on our roadtrip to NYC and was really excited to taste an authentic Philly Cheesesteak sandwich. Unfortunately, Geno's was not the place. I got it with provolone and it was dry. The fries were soggy. The whole experience was blah. The place itself was a joint where you order from a window. One window for the sandwiches and another window for fries and drinks, so that's two lines you have to wait in. As far as service goes, there's not much. The people working there were not that helpful or friendly for a restaurant that has a lot of tourists coming through. They were just there doing their job of passing out food and collecting money. If you're like me and looking for a sandwich dripping with sauce and cheese, this is not the place to get it from. I don't even remember tasting cheese. The best part was the soft bread. I think I've had a better Philly cheeststeak from the D&B's in California."
7007,9,3,1,7/9/2013,I have only been to Geno's Steaks once so its hard for me to judge.
7008,9,3,1,7/9/2013,Tourist spot. ˜Sub-par steaks. ˜Not enough meat on the bun. ˜Many other better places to go to. ˜It is open late night. ˜Good for an after drunk Cheese Steak when everyone else is closed..
7009,9,1,1,7/8/2013,"So we drove to Philly over the weekend and wanted to experience what all the rave was about at both Pat's and Geno's (you can find my review for Pat's on their page). Well where do I begin? The location is horrible, such an unsafe neighborhood in an unsafe city, parking was horrendous (we had to park nearly 3 blocks away) and I for one felt really uncomfortable leaving my nice car parked in such a torn down neighborhood. So, we walk over to the stands (they're not restaurants.. just stands where you order food) get in line at Geno's (which for some odd reason stretches into the middle of the street; the line that is) the wait was about the same as it was at Pat's approx 10 minutes which wasn't bad for a ""tourist trap"" food stand. The service was here was somewhat better, the yelling was kept to a minimun. Once we ordered we stood on the counter space and ate there. We got a ""wit american"" sandwich which was pretty bad... the meat was under seasoned (i see a pattern between the two places) the cheese was ok (at least it was melted), the bread was hard unpleasant. So what makes this a one star and the place across the street a two star? Well for one, we didn't see ROACHES crawling up and down the wall of Pat's like we did here, nor was the other stand littered with trash up and down it's sides. Overall, the whole experience was very disappointing, after all the talk and hoopla about this place it truly wasn't anything special. People say ""well you go there for the experience"" what experience are they talking about? horrible parking, bad smells, rude people, mediocre food & ROACHES?"
7010,9,1,1,7/8/2013,"Only give this one star cause I have to. ˜IT IS A BIG FAT ZERO IN MY BOOK. ˜My wife and I had to try both Pat's and Geno's to compare for ourselves which is the best. ˜I reviewed Pat's also. ˜You can read that review as well. ˜We ordered one ""wit whiz and wit"" from each place. Honestly, I don't know why this place continues to exist except for the hype TV gives it. ˜There is nothing about this place that would make me want to come back. ˜Even if they gave me a lifetime free pass for food I would go elsewhere......PASS. So the truth about the feud....Pat's is much better than Geno's. ˜The meat was flavorless....no spices.......the hoagie roll was cold......the Whiz was one small squirt and only on one end of the sandwich. ˜The onions were not even cooked through. ˜Talk about hype.......Pat's blows Geno's out of the swimming pool. Truth be told this would be the last place in Philly I would come for a decent sandwich. ˜We have a local chain called: Big John's Steak and Onion that makes a better sandwich that either of these two. ˜ As for getting there.....these two establishments are in a bad part of town. ˜Parking is terrible. ˜We parked about a block away, right in front of a storefront where they were raising chickens. ˜The stench was overwhelming. ˜Garbage was everywhere. ˜These Philadephians need to learn to throw their garbage away like the rest of the world. ˜The entire city needs a bath. ˜We had to work our way around all types of litter and garbage. ˜Nice way to eat a meal. ˜The smell of chicken crap and rotting garbage just enhances the meal so much (sarcasm Sheldon). My advice, go to Reading Terminal Market if you want to experience a Philly Cheese Steak. ˜At least you have a seat and dessert is but a few steps away, and when I say dessert I don't mean some type of crunchy cookie but excellent desserts. Sorry Geno's you don't even rate a one in my book. Time to find another line of work."
7011,9,2,1,7/7/2013,Purely for the Pat's v. Geno's debate. I prefer Jim's on South
7012,9,1,1,7/7/2013,"LIsten to me fellow Yelpers! I am SORRY!...I didn't believe or heed your reviews! This was seriously one of the worst cheesesteaks I have ever had. It really is over-hyped. Why did I go here? I am stationed in Maryland (Go AIr Force!) and my family and I were driving on I-95 here in town and at around 3PM i had a vision of an amazing dinner! For some reason Philly popped into my head. So I told the family, ""Hold on; we are going to Philly; I want a cheesesteak...from that famous place!"". So, I stayed on 95 going North and braced for the 2 hour drive. Got to Philly...never been; very nice! Drove straight to Geno's and was amazed how cool the environment was. Its a cross between Ghetto and Suburban...Pretty sure the cops and the mafia have told the thieves, murderers and gang bangers to STAY away from the tourist and white people! lol....because there were alot of white people and oddly enough kids and stuff in that area. Anyway...it was inviting but yet made you stay on your toes about where you actually were...in a big city! So the line to get the sandwich was quick ($9...cash only!) then another line to get drinks and fries! All and all its about $30 for 2 cheesesteaks and 2 sodas and fry. Enough about the dumb stuff, here is the down low: Pros: environment culture lively experience Cons: expensive crowded no exceptional taste to sandwich dry bread was chewy So all and all, the place was cool, lights definately made a difference in my choice of places (Genos or Pats), but it really did suck! Seriously...there was nothing special about it! Enjoy the post!"
7013,9,1,1,7/6/2013,"Wasn't impressed, seemed like a great idea to make the trip on my Hayabusa with my fellow riders from DC for a steak but I can honestly say I've had better outside of Philly than Geno's so I'm confused about the whole thing. ˜Overpriced, very little meat, cheese whiz was ridiculously runny...so disappointed I didn't even get into the SECOND line after waiting in the long first line for steaks only to get fries. ˜Excuse me, ""American Fries""...which by the way unlike many that work there I've served in the military 23 years and can call them whatever kind of fries I want."
7014,9,4,1,7/5/2013,"I had the cheesesteak and the pork. ˜not a big fan of the pork but the cheesesteak is definitely8 better than pat's. ˜if you like hot spicy food, make sure you use their x sauce. ˜ it's spicy as hell and will kick your ass if you don't repsect it."
7015,9,3,1,7/4/2013,Always consistent ˜ ˜ A Philadelphia tradition. ˜ ˜ Usually better than their competition (Pat's Steaks)
7016,9,1,1,7/3/2013,"I grew up around the corner from here and pretty much everything about Geno's is awful. The neon, the steaks, and the absurd politics of South Philly's racist Italian Uncle, Joey Vento.. this place has no redeeming qualities. If you want to support the legacy of a white supremacist, homophobic bigot and eat the most overrated, grisly, rough cheesesteaks known to man by all means, go to Geno's. But if you have any respect for human dignity and want to eat something that taste goods, try literally *any* South Philly corner store and you'll find a better steak. edit: ok, so Vento is undoubtedly burning in neon faux-vegas hell as we speak, and i hear his family is less ridiculous, but still, the jingoism and fascist reaction that adorn the place... na vergogna."
7017,9,3,1,7/3/2013,"Geno's is a popular tourist attraction in South Philly that also sells cheesesteaks. I say this because the most frequent argument regarding the iconic sandwich is ""Pat's or Geno's""? The answer, as anyone who lives here knows, is neither. Better steaks can be had in other local chains as well as on many Philly street corners, but Geno's is fine for what it is. It has a walk-up window where customers can order their food (in ENGLISH, dammit! They make a point of letting you know that to help rid the line of pesky foreigners and their ""biftecks du fromage"" or whatever), a window to pick it up, and some outdoor seating to enjoy your food in whatever language you want. Service is about what you'd expect at a stationary food cart. Make your order, get your food and go away. If you want bottle service or valet parking, you've come to the wrong cheesesteak spot. The actual food is fine as well. The steaks are smallish but tasty, the fries are made fresh and hot with enough salt, and they didn't screw up the fountain soda either. Nothing to rave about for veterans, but newcomers to the cheesesteak experience will likely enjoy it. Overall, Geno's is a solid representation of cheesesteaks for anyone who hasn't had one. I imagine Geno's is to Philly what the Statue of Liberty is to New York...go if you come here, but not if you live here."
7018,9,3,1,7/1/2013,What I don't like is when they slice the frozen bull meat you get so much gristle which make it chewy. The fry are good considering the come in pellet form. just ass water lol Sorry but since Bobby left God rest his soul DOWNHILL
7019,9,1,1,7/1/2013,"Cold meat, unmelted cheese, rude staff-- ˜there are probably a thousand better cheesesteak ˜places in the city. ˜I have no reason to ever return to this place."
7020,9,2,1,7/1/2013,"So, I was just in Philly this weekend and decided to try a different cheesteak place other than my regular in North Philly. ˜When we came up on Geno's we noticed that Pat's was right across the street. ˜Shame on us for picking Geno's based solely upon the presentation of the venue. ˜Passing by Pat's looked a lil shabby, but the cheesteaks looked more appealing. The line at Geno's was long,but moved quickly..why? because they were shelling out already made sandwhiches. ˜The cashier was cool but when the person in front of us pushed the window back to hear the cashier, another coworker snatched the window back closed, which the cashier pushed right back open, THAT WAS RUDE. The steak on the cheesesteak had no flavor, and the only thing that made mine edible was dousing it in the juice from the cherry pepper. ˜ Needless to say before gettting back on the road to VA, we retracked our steps back to NORTH PHILLY, and got a damn good cheesteak!!"
7021,9,3,1,6/30/2013,"I've been here once about two summers ago, and to be completely honest, I was more than disappointed. Why come here for a Philly Cheesesteak when food carts all over Philadelphia offer equally authentic cheesesteak sandwiches? The magic cheese whiz was a little unappetizing, but people don't come here for the food, but more for the ""been-there, done-that experience."" To my disappointment, the cashier shouted at me for seemingly to have taken my time to order, and corrected me for incorrectly calling the fries ""French Fries"" instead of ""American Fries."" Sorry but not sorry, I didn't have the time to finish reading the menu before I was yelled at. I think being Asian-American here made the situation worse (based on the way I was treated by the cashier), and the Italian Market up the street past 6pm made me feel out of place and uncomfortable. To be fair, that was one of my first experiences anywhere outside of UCity. I heart Pat's across the street is nicer, but I haven't been there personally. Aside from the bad treatment, I'm just glad I've made a trip down there, and whenever asked the ""Pat's or Geno's"" question, I always gladly pick Pat's even though I haven't been. At least I don't think I'll be yelled at my the cashier there."
7022,9,2,1,6/30/2013,"Sure, it's famous, but it's far from the best in town. I know that the angry guy behind the counter yelling at you to ""Hurry up and order"" is supposed to be part of the experience or whatever, but I'd rather go to a nice, family run place and get some much better food without the hassle."
7023,9,2,1,6/29/2013,"I wish it was the case that the conversation about the best cheesesteaks in Philly came down to Pat's versus Geno's. ˜The reality is that both places are more hype than substance. ˜If you are looking for a fun, touristy experience, by all means go to either of these establishments. ˜Either restaurant is a great way to end a bachelor party or a guys' night out. ˜However, as a guy who is more interested in a great sandwich than a social scene, I wouldn't waste my time. ˜If you are swayed by food quality and taste and want to have the best cheesesteak (as opposed to social experience), go to Jim's on South Street, Dellasandro's on Ridge, or Mama's in Bala Cynwyd."
7024,9,4,1,6/29/2013,"Quick service, sliced steak with American cheese, nice bun, very filling, liked this better than Pat's!"
7025,9,3,1,6/29/2013,"its a good philly cheesesteak, but it's a little pricey. they don't offer water, which to me is just weird. the cheese fries were delicious but also too much."
7026,9,4,1,6/29/2013,"You're either a Pat's guy or a Geno's guy. I am a Geno's guy, all the way. It's a classic Philly establishment, with a Philly attitude and I love it. It's a staple of the community and it's got great food to boot. I love the hearty cheesesteaks, and they're probably my favorite in-city joint. Only thing that is disappointing is the lack of seating once it gets crowded."
7027,9,1,1,6/28/2013,"Food was ok, employees friendly but they are racist and generalize which was disrespectful, for them to be an attraction of PA( Big NO NO)"
7028,9,1,1,6/28/2013,"This is a definite tourist trap. And locals really only hit it up late night when they are extremely drunk and nothing else is open. I have had better cheese steaks around town. Overpriced, greasy, and gross."
7029,9,3,1,6/28/2013,"I like Geno's. ˜I like Pats. ˜I like them all. ˜But Geno's makes me feel a little more ""Philly"" !!! ˜I like the attitude, I can't help it. ˜And frankly, compared to Pat's they are a LOT cleaner. ˜I sort of skev Pats. ˜Jim's on South and Tony Luke's, as well as Delissandro's are still my very favorites, but late night grub from Geno's RULES."
7030,9,2,1,6/27/2013,"Always great people watching, especially late night. The drunker you are the better the steaks. Still, even S*&%faced, not that great. Whatever, do it once and make your own opinion, it's worth the experience at least."
7031,9,3,1,6/27/2013,Too hyped up. Definately prefer Pat's
7032,9,2,1,6/27/2013,"Tourist trap, plenty of better options elsewhere."
7033,9,4,1,6/27/2013,"Whats a trip to Philadelphia without stoping here? Its a large sandwich full of meat, and toppings. You can not feel hungry after eating one of his world famous Cheese-Steak sandwiches. It very clean inside and out and you get what you pay for a nice big sandwich. You can not go wrong trying a world famous Geno's cheese-steak.."
7034,9,2,1,6/26/2013,"When it comes to the rivalry Pat's vs Geno's; Pats wins. Geno's just has some weird taste to each part of their product. The bread just seems off, the whiz is just congealed, and steak as a whole is a good concept, but it gets really stringy. I avoid Geno's and tell any person visiting Philadelphia to also avoid."
7035,9,3,1,6/25/2013,"Pats and Genos are the same --- tourist trap cheesesteaks but with lots of character. Take out-of-towners here, but you know the real locals go to John's Roast Pork, Tony Lukes, Dalessandro's, etc. The pluses are the convenient location to the Italian Market and that its open like 24/7. Whiz wit is the way to go. Get the peppers from the pepper bar."
7036,9,2,1,6/21/2013,"Pats and Genos are Philadelphia institutions.....terrible, terrible institutions. Save the calories. If you are a tourist, go here for the experience, then promptly go somewhere else for your cheesesteak."
5320,9,4,1,6/21/2013,"Philly classic, made even more famous by the late Joey Vento's insistance on ordering in English only. ˜ This is a late night Philly tradition, if you're drunk and need to soak up some of the alcohol, you'll find yourself here 9 out of 10 times. ˜I If you're going to go out for a cheesesteak for lunch or dinner and are looking for a gourmet version, this isn't it. ˜What you get here is a large and hearty sandwich at the first window, average fries and drinks at the second. I guess if you're a local (as in you live walking distance from it), you will try some of the other things on the menu, but if you drove or took a cab here like 99% of the other people, you're here for the cheesesteak. The strict rules for ordering are mostly tongue in cheek, you'll see every other person in line ignore the sign and order it in their own way so don't be intimidated. ˜The staff here realize their livelihood depends on the tourist dollars, don't let their attitude fool you."
7037,9,3,1,6/20/2013,"Wanted to try the original cheesesteaks so I went to both Pat's and Geno's. The only difference was I got Whiz at Pat's and provolone at Geno's. Overall, they're both about the same though it seemed like the bread was better at Pat's. Overall I give the nod to Pat's but honestly, you can get better cheesesteak than you'll find at either one."
7038,9,3,1,6/19/2013,"Great Philly Cheesesteaks, just like Pat's across the street but they suffer the same problem. ˜Miserable staff. ˜It is kind of a running joke with these places that if you order wrong they get mad. ˜Sometimes, I think it is a good idea to move on and find a new job if you are miserable because it show's in your work. ˜Again, great food, but terrible attitudes."
7039,9,3,1,6/19/2013,"A famous and flamboyant part of South Philly, Geno's is an experience unique to Philadelphia. The cheesesteaks (and fries and drinks) are a bit overpriced, the rudeness and bigotry (""English speakers only"") are off-putting, and the huge collection of law-enforcement patches are, with the most cynical interpretation, a disturbing ode to authoritarian establishment such as is rarely seen. A possible plus is that, while Geno's aways seems somewhat busy, I didn't have to wait in a long line to eat (unlike Jim's, where I had to wait an hour). The cheesesteak itself, while enjoyable, was not as otherworldly as some might claim, and others might expect. ˜ Despite all of that, I have to admit that I enjoy the gaudiness of the neon and the bright-as-day lights that come on at night. There is a certain ""fun"" quality to this place, and it attracts all sorts of people (the locals, the tourists, the young, the old, the panhandlers; I even saw ""Santa"" here once during the Christmas season, eating a cheesesteak after a hard day's work, still in full costume). Geno's is not a place to come if you want a good value, or great food. It doesn't earn the amount of business it gets through taste, quality, or service. The draw of Geno's (somewhat tenuous) claims to history or authenticity are largely countered by its Disneyland-esque fakeness. But I would say it's worth visiting once, seeing the lights at night, trying a cheesesteak ""wit provolone and onions,"" comparing it to the one found across the street at Pat's and enjoying the uniquely Philadelphian experience."
7040,9,2,1,6/17/2013,Geno's used to be great. The last time I went there the meat in the sandwich had a lot of fat in it. I won't go back.
7041,9,2,1,6/16/2013,Tourist trap....on to the next one.
7042,9,3,1,6/14/2013,"Leg 2 and second place winner of our unofficial cheesesteak throw down. ˜ Tony Luke's just blew this out of the water. ˜ Bread had a more prefab taste and texture but don't get me wrong, it is till a fairly tasty cheesesteak"
7043,9,1,1,6/14/2013,Nothing but a tourist trap. ˜First time in Philly and felt we needed to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak. ˜I've had FAR better ones in MD. ˜Bread was good but very little meat and cheese. ˜It's a pain to find parking too on these little narrow streets. Don't waste your time. ˜Seriously....you reading this....skip it!
7044,9,3,1,6/14/2013,"Perfectly fine cheesesteaks, but the line for Geno's (and Pat's) are always so long because of tourists. If you want to go to one of the ""famous"" places, check it out, it probably won't disappoint. Of the two down there, I generally prefer Pat's, mostly because of some of the racial issues and less glitz and lights than Geno's. I'd go to Cosmi's over either of the two big ones though."
7045,9,5,1,6/13/2013,"You come to Pat's and Geno's for the history more than the food quality. While they still argue over who was first, I'll let you be the judge as to whose tastes better. And since they are literally across the street from each other, I encourage you to do what we've always done and try them both for that real Philly experience. Besides, dinging either one of these places for taste would be like giving the Liberty Bell a bad rating because it has a crack in it and doesn't ring pure anymore. These places are historic institutions and the heart of some of Philly's heritage. With that said, I've been coming here since the 80's and for my money right now have a slight leaning towards Geno's. Here's my breakdown: Pat's: * dryer bread and meat * crunchy onions * cheaper wiz * harsher service Geno's: * juicy meat * carmelized onions * steamed roll * gooey cheese * friendlier staff While they are both institutions, I prefer to have that greasy, juicy flavor dripping off my cheesteak. A couple final recommendations before stepping up to the window: read the instructions and learn the lingo. It's rather simple and broken down into but three steps. And bring cash, they don't take plastic. This will definitely make your experience a more memorable one. Both of these places are famous for a reason and one of those ""must-see-stops"" on a tour of Philadelphia."
7046,9,3,1,6/13/2013,"Good but definitely not the best, in the battle of Cheesesteaks this places around 4th in my book. ˜Pats which is across the street is better but even then there is still two more that are better 1) Stever Princes and 2.) Jims Steaks."
7047,9,1,1,6/10/2013,Highly Over rated! Both Ginos and Pats.
7048,9,2,1,6/10/2013,It's fine. Bread was good. Steak was okay though difficult to eat due to the size of the pieces. Fried onions were fine. I can't understand the cheese whiz thing to save my life so I skipped that and did provolone. I am new to the area and will try them all until I find the one that makes me understand why this city famous for cheese steak.
7049,9,1,1,6/10/2013,"Business brought me to Philly and I had to try this place since I've heard about it from friends and on various Food network shout outs. ˜Well, it was not anything I expected. ˜The steak was extremely bland with a severe lack of flavor. ˜The bread was absolute 'meh.' ˜I will say Geno's is clean and bright and the folks seemed a tad on the friendlier side (compared to Pat's King of Steaks) ...but the sandwich itself wasn't any good. ˜Oh...and it's pricey too. ˜$8 for an overrated steak and cheese sandwich is nuts."
7050,9,1,1,6/9/2013,"I just moved to Philly and thought I should try the Geno's vs. Pat's thing. I happened to order from Geno's first simply because it was closer. I ordered a ""provolone with"", but what I got was a mediocre cheesesteak with a side of racism. The bread was good, but the steak was overcooked and the onions were too big and had too little flavor. Even the provolone was flavorless and just kind of became indistinguishable from the bread. I didn't try the ""freedom fries,"" but I assume they would be just as bland as the steaks, albeit with more freedom. Whatever that means. The ""speak English"" signs were delightfully ironic; as there were only a handful of white people eating at Geno's while Pat's was bustling with a much more multi-ethnic crowd. Anyway, for the best cheesesteaks made in ""Murika,"" give Geno's a try. For the best cheesesteak in Philly, you'd be better off pretty much anywhere else."
7051,9,1,1,6/9/2013,"I'm a Philly girl. Therefore, I've tried out countless cheesesteaks from different places. This place is by far, one of the worst cheesesteaks I've ever eaten. For the prices they charge, I would think that the quality would be a little better. I still can't figure out what the hype is all about. Til this day, I still don't know. The meat is dry, big, and chunky. It's like they just chop the meat up, toss it on the grill, and leave the juices to drain for hours. I shouldn't feel like I will be choking everytime I bite and chew the darn thing. As for the cheese and mushrooms, tastes like it is straight from the can. The reasons why I'm giving it a 1 star is because: 1) there's no 0s and 2) the only thing that is yummy is the pickled peppers that sits on the outside part of Geno's with the condiments. Do yourself a favor and save your time and money. Definitely not worth it, this goes for tourists as well as the locals."
7052,9,4,1,6/7/2013,Steves Prince of Steaks is actually the best and now that there is a center city location i am ecstatic. ˜they both lack in meat but the taste makes up for it.
7053,9,4,1,6/7/2013,"I am personally choose Pat's over Geno's, but you really can't go wrong with either."
7054,9,1,1,6/7/2013,"Most disgusting Cheesesteak in Philadelphia. It is for Tourist, I have no reason to go there unless I want to go to the bathroom afterwards. TMI I know but this is true Tourist beware this is not what a Philly cheesesteak is supposed to taste like. Try Joe's formerly known as Chinks the best cheesesteak in the city!"
7055,9,2,1,6/6/2013,"Having tried both places, Geno's is definitely much better than Pat's. Compared to what else the city has to offer however, Geno's just doesn't cut it."
7056,9,4,1,6/4/2013,"It's funny how Geno's is directly across the street from Pat's. ˜Actually, quite smart bc people are bound to go try both at least to compare....well, that's what I did. ˜After having a philly cheese steak at Pats, bf and I walked over to Geno's. ˜I must say, we both preferred Geno's. ˜We ordered it with. ˜(That means with onions.) ˜The bread roll had a egg wash gloss on the top and had a chewy texture which I liked. ˜The steak itself was in thick slices and really had that beef flavor. ˜We also ordered it with provolone. ˜ Geno's sammich was also quite huge. ˜Good thing I shared that one too!"
7057,9,3,1,6/4/2013,"Ate at Geno's on a recent trip to Philadelphia. The sandwich was good, but I liked Pat s best. Everyone in my group seemed to have a different take on the Pat's vs Geno's debate, so I guess it's just a matter of personal preference. Try em both and decide for yourself!"
7058,9,1,1,6/4/2013,"Dissapointing! My wife and I were in town visiting from San Francisco and wanted to ""eat a Philly Cheesesteak in Philly"". ˜We heard alot about Geno's and decided to try them out. It literally took 30 seconds from the time we ordered until receiving our food. The meat was pre cooked, onions already grilled and bread was cold. It was all slapped together in seconds. We were extremely dissapointed!"
7059,9,1,1,6/4/2013,"noone goes here but friends, family, and tourists"
7060,9,2,1,6/3/2013,"Sorry, but I'd have to say Pat's had the better of the cheesesteak between the two. It just wasn't good. It might have been that we got Geno's whiz wit and Pat's whiz witout (chose provolone instead) (not a true competition anymore, I know) and I soon found out I wasn't a fan of the whiz. Onions were also more raw than cooked just like at Pat's. Didn't enjoy."
7061,9,1,1,6/3/2013,"Geno's has one of the worst steaks in Philly and the owner seems like a xenophobic jerk to boot, so, yeah, don't go here."
7062,9,2,1,6/3/2013,"Come bye to take a photo, then go and get a better cheese steak somewhere else. ˜There is nothing special about these steaks and they are 9 bucks!! Not worth the trip"
7063,9,3,1,6/3/2013,"Okay cheese steak. I gave Pat's a 2, and liked Geno's better so Geno's gets a 3. I would say the service or people who work at Geno's is much more friendly compared to Pat's. Luckily, when I was in the area there was not a huge line at both places so I got to try both and compare. Overall, both places = ehh.. Geno's is better in terms of flavor and the bread/roll. The meat at Pat's was more juicy compared to Geno's which was a little bit on the drier side. I would probably not go to either places again given that I can find better cheese steaks (or just the same) in NYC. The ones I make at home also taste just as good... and of course, I get more meat. If you're in Philly and have never tried Pats or Geno's, I would recommend that you try for the experience, but do not have any expectations as far as food/taste. ˜You will be rather disappointed."
7064,9,1,1,6/3/2013,"Eek! Methinks not. If you are a true Philadelphian, you know that the best cheesesteaks can only be found at your local corner store and you'd never wait in line for a 10 dollars steaks. Nuff said."
7065,9,2,1,6/2/2013,chewy bread. tough steak. not enough cheese whiz.
7066,9,3,1,6/2/2013,The cheese-steak was okay. ˜The onions they added were good but they were chintzy with the provolone. ˜The hot sauce was very hot.
7067,9,3,1,6/1/2013,"geno's was better than pat's but the sandwich was just a bit better. Service was good but did not get the whole ordering the sandwich separate from the soda and french fries. I would have thought if its that busy, just having multiple windows? either way was ok one and done kind of place. as i said for Pat's, dont know if the quality was because I came at 330am"
7068,9,3,1,5/31/2013,"I appreciated the quality of the bread and the proper proportioning and composition of the sandwich- it was perfectly balanced, not overpowered by wiz for example. The only faults I found was that the meat wasn't seasoned (but this might be a plus for cheesesteak purists) and the onions were served raw on the sandwich (and again it is possible that this is how the cheesesteak is intended to be served)."
7069,9,3,1,5/31/2013,"I really like their bread! The meat isn't chopped up so it doesn't come off as a normal cheesesteak. It reminds me of a steak-um but doesn't taste store bought. Not a lot of cheese, not a lot of onions, just kinda blah. I normally don't take people here, from out of town, because I have better cheesesteak places but the Geno's vs Pat's challenge is classic. Cheese fries were alright. The signs around Geno's are disturbing. I don't know much of the back story but they do annoy me and that is probably half of the reason I don't frequent this place."
7070,9,1,1,5/30/2013,"Bland, dry steak is seldom better when you serve it up with a side of racism. Pat's .... by far. And, if you're local, try Jim's or Tony Luke's."
7071,9,3,1,5/27/2013,Good street food and an authentic Philly experience. However overpriced and standard. Still a fun outing!
7072,9,2,1,5/26/2013,"First time in Philly, so we did the touristy thing and went to Geno's. We were gonna split one there and one at Pat's for comparison, but the lines were so insane that we decided to just stick with Geno's and try Pat's another time. In fairness, the line moved pretty well. It was wrapped pretty far around the building and we made it to the window in about 20 minutes. I had brushed up on the ordering process before hand, so the actual transactions went smoothly. The food itself was pretty unremarkable. The fries were decent, but it was all way overpriced and the cheesesteak was disappointing. Not much meat, especially for $9. As far as the vibe of the place, I gotta say that late owner Joey Vento must have been one of the world's great assholes. Dumb, racist stickers on the windows demanding people ""SPEAK ENGLISH."" Behind me in line were several groups of Asian students and tourists, many of them seeming to have a fairly shaky grasp on the English language. And why wouldn't they? So don't worry, Joey Vento, wherever you are, I was embarrassed enough for both of us. I doubt I'll ever be patronizing your place again, and I'll make sure to steer others away as well."
7073,9,2,1,5/26/2013,"I got to admit we were drawn by the long lines. The wait was not that bad since there were almost no options. Service aside, which was below average, the food itself was also sub par. We had one provolone and one American both with onions. The cheesesteak was plain and the bread was dry. The cheese fries was wet and undercooked. This place does not deserve the hype and long lines. You can get better cheesesteak from places with no line. Don't let all the celebrity pictures fool you!!"
7074,9,1,1,5/26/2013,"Philadelphia institution of bull****. Racist signs everywhere (against mexicans, asians, African Americans, you pick one...) and according to my friends who were visiting Philly (yes, I would not even touch that crap they serve even if I ate meat) the cheesesteak was dry and definitely not worth the trip. Not sure if I being from Philadelphia I would be proud of having this horrible place as a local attraction."
7075,9,2,1,5/24/2013,"Mass produced and just whatever. I'm not from Philadelphia and everyone I talk to from Philly say Geno's and Pat's are tourist traps and there are plenty of places to find a better cheesesteak. The only positive it it's open late and if you're impatient, they'll have your sandwich ready within seconds."
7076,9,4,1,5/23/2013,"Great stop after a concert or event in south Philly. ˜Gotta learn the lingo so they get the order right! Nonstop battle with their neighbor ""Pat's"" for the crown of Best Philly Cheesesteak."
7077,9,2,1,5/16/2013,Worse than Pat's.
7078,9,1,1,5/16/2013,"Geno's has the big name, but after living in Philly and exploring the cheese-steak market in great detail...there are MUCH better places to go. One plus is that this place is ALWAYS open. You want a cheesesteak at 5am? You got it! The ambiance is cool if you are a tourist. There is always a big crowd and the blinding neon lights are definitely a sight to see. Drive or walk by and then go somewhere else to eat! The sandwich is just OK, with a good amount of fatty pieces left on the meat. Pretty expensive and nothing special compared to many other places I've been. The worst part of this place is the service. When you get to the window and see a sticker that says, ""This is America, when ordering SPEAK ENGLISH"" above another sticker that says, ""Management reserves the right to refuse service"" --- That sort of sums it up. They pride themselves on being the tough, South Philly folk who will tell you off if you don't order the way they want you to. You will definitely get an eye roll if you ask for ""Cheese Whiz and Fried Onions"" instead of ""Wiz Wit."" If you want a cheese-steak served by a bunch of people who think it's ok to be racist and offensive and serve crappy food...go to Geno's. If you're looking for a late-late night cheese-steak after a night of heavy drinking...I'd suggest Pat's across the street. If you actually want a good sandwich, go to Jim's on South Street or John's Roast Pork off of Columbus Blvd."
7079,9,1,1,5/16/2013,A bunch of racist bigots that sell sloppy cheese steaks. ˜Tourists only.
7080,9,1,1,5/15/2013,Overrated!!! Jim's Steaks in West Philly and Tony Luke's are waaaaaaay better.
7081,9,2,1,5/14/2013,"Interesting ambiance, but the food quality is like the customer service-- ˜rough! Steak was dry and mystery meat-like. Provolone was paltry. The bread was ok."
7082,9,3,1,5/14/2013,"It was an okay steak and cheese, but nothing special. ˜A tad dry. Steak was dry, flat, very steak'um like. Provolone was a super small thin slice. I much prefer when the meat is chopped up and has a decent amount of cheese. Roll was okay. ˜ Flair was pretty cool, seems like they have every single police/sheriff badge in the U.S. It's probably worth it to go once just for the experience. *** I am from New Haven, CT and there were many places with way better subs. While its now closed, Geno's comes no where near the ol' Frank and Mary's place in Worcester Square."
7083,9,1,1,5/14/2013,"It's an overhyped & overpriced tourist trap. I lived in Philly for years before heading to Seattle. I've had a few cheesesteaks in those days but never hit Geno's. So, this time when we were back with the kids we thought we'd give it a go. Wow, what a mistake. The sandwiches had virtually no meat yet cost 9 bucks each. The staff was typical South Philly...short and impersonal. There was nothing ""special"" at all. There is way better available out there. I won't recommend Pats across the street because we didn't eat there. But, we did walk by. I saw that their sandwiches were way meatier. I don't know how they taste or what they cost but they looked a a whole lot better."
7084,9,1,1,5/12/2013,"You know what's real American? Capitalism. Freedom to decide what business I give a dollar to. Geno's is gung-ho about ""freedom fries"", making sure I'm aware that white people originated in the America's, and that I should glorify a police officer who was slain in 1981 when there is MUCH more to that story. I'm spending more time discussing the politics and marketing of Genos over their cheesesteaks because their cheesesteaks are not worth talking about. Maybe at one time 30 or 40 years ago they might have had more flavor, used higher grade cheese, and the ""cute"" rivalry with Pat's across the street for who's best was relevant. Times have changed and the area is more diverse now. The blend of cultures is apparent ˜and in 2013, with ways to learn of a business through social media, its not all about you (the company) anymore. I shall take my American dollar and mouth elsewhere. Oh, and I'll put my American middle finger in the air facing Geno's while I'm at it."
7085,9,3,1,5/10/2013,I am a philly cheese steak fan so the sandwich was good but overpriced. I will give them one star for being ignorant with the 'Speak English sign'. So if a German tourist orders in broken English will you send him to Pat's ?
7086,9,1,1,5/9/2013,"rude, gross, done."
7087,9,1,1,5/9/2013,"Bad steaks, bad ingredients, bad decor, bad customer service (I don't care if you post ""rules""), bad manners, bad politics--and ironically bad English (English shouldn't be the official language of the U.S. and remember if it were, ""wiz"" and ""wit"" aren't English words). I'd rather starve than patronize this place. Tourists, go to Pat's if you really want the experience, but seriously get a steak from John's Roast Pork if you really want one."
7088,9,1,1,5/8/2013,"If you care more about neon signs than what you put on your taste-buds, this is the steak place for you! ˜It looks good on TV, which explains why out of state tourists know all about how good it really is. I couldn't even finish the steak I got from here it was so gross. I'd rather go hungry. One star for the color orange."
7089,9,3,1,5/8/2013,"The cheesesteak and cheese fries are awesome but they're a bit overpriced. ˜Plus it's difficult to go here without being surrounded by drunks or wackos (at basically any time of day), but that's okay, I'm usually drunk upon arrival as well. It's a little nervewracking to have to specifically order ""wit wiz"" or however they want you to do it, and they look at you like you have three heads if you fail to recall that drinks are sold at the ""next"" window. So if you're okay being a drunk idiot who'll pay top dollar for a pretty good cheesesteak, check it out."
7090,9,5,1,5/7/2013,I prefer Pat's but I won't ever turn down the chance to come here if someone wants to go. ˜Always wiz wit. Good For: Breakfast Brunch Lunch Dinner Late Night Dessert
7091,9,1,1,5/5/2013,"Im ˜a philly kid, so I knew going into this which was better, but the wife and kids have never been down to the old cheesesteak block in South Philly, so for fun we all did the ole blind taste test, with the family, between Pats (the dirty looking place across the street from Genos) and Genos, which looks like Las Vegas threw up in south Philly. ˜ Unamimously we all chose Pats.. their steaks just tasted better, although steak was slightly greasier (if thats a word) attitudes at both places BLOW, youre not gonna wanna go there for the friggin ambiance !....trust me nothng like wanting to punch the guy taking your order. ˜ Genos looks ALOT cleaner than Pats, Pats tastes ALOT better than Genos ... simple as that. ˜ Thats not saying, that Pats is great either..trust me there are MANY better steaks around Philly, but in the showdown between the 2 we felt Pats was clearly better tasting Both have better steaks than Tony Lukes (get the roast pork at Lukes, Im telling you) Its a tourist thing at best just like the locals say there ARE WAAAY better steaks out there"
7092,9,1,1,5/4/2013,"While visiting Geno's on June 13th I was subjected to the front cashiers' racist attitude. She made it very clear she was not serving my wife (a black caribbean woman) by twice ignoring her and asking the gentleman behind her (White) what he was having. The cashier's behavior was very clear and because of that I would never visit this establishment again. Do not to go to Geno's for their Freedom Fries because evidently we are not as of yet free. The owners should take that cashier off the window and remind her in what country she lives and works. More to the point however, the entire ""sandwich"" - mushy and bland, other then the overwhelming SALTINESS. Salt is not a substitute for flavor, despite what your Freedom Fries might believe."
7093,9,2,1,5/4/2013,"I was in Philly a few years back and decided to stop by this place because I saw it on the food network. The thing that stuck out the most to me was not the taste of the sandwich, but how overpriced it was and how under-sized it was. If I remember correctly, it was more than 8 bucks for a small ""Hoagie"" with cheese.(it's now 9 bucks) It was a good tasting sandwich but after what you pay for a cheese-steak and a drink, you are still hungry afterwards and hence - unsatisfied. A ripoff tourist trap. In NYC we make better sandwiches in our sleep...and for much better prices. Hey Geno's..go F*ck yourselves."
7094,9,1,1,5/3/2013,"Big lights! Tourist Trap! Cheap ingredients, not fresh and there is plenty of bread...if that is your thing. I think that only people in Philly know that if they want a good Philly cheesesteak, there are plenty of other places to go...let alone from ignorant folk at Geno's who don't serve people who may have trouble speaking English. HoHum, many Americans need to travel more...I mean beyond Jersey shore."
7095,9,1,1,5/3/2013,"Not good at all. I don't know why ppl go there, no taste no salt no pepper no dressing nothing just the meat and the cheese"
7096,9,2,1,5/2/2013,"Touristy, average quality, long lines and wait time."
7097,9,1,1,5/2/2013,"Geno's (and Pat's, for that matter) is just the Philly posterboy for cheesesteaks. There are 8 million places that are infinitely better all over the city."
7098,9,2,1,4/30/2013,"So this place is very bittersweet... Having never had a philly cheesesteak from Philly before it was delicious, nonetheless! But the service and staff was beyond unpleasant. They were rude about their ordering procedures, and rude to other patrons, to top it off parking is ridiculously hard to find."
7099,9,2,1,4/28/2013,"2.5 stars is my review for Geno cheesesteak. ˜I ordered the cheesesteak with onion cost $9. ˜I don't like how my meat is so thick and it's a bit chewy. ˜The sandwich has too much juice dripping making it pretty messy to eat. ˜Geno's place is nicer than Pat, and they have more seating but I still think Pat is better."
7100,9,1,1,4/27/2013,"If you have friends or family from out of town and they want to experience ""the Philly cheesesteak,"" bring them here. BUT, do not park; in fact, do not even let them get out of your car. Just drive by. Let them see it. Let them see the lines (make sure you take them during the 2am-post-bars-closed time period, to give them the full effect). Then, when they had their fill of watching people wait in line for 30+ minutes for a terrible cheesesteak, take them somewhere else. Anywhere else. I've had cheesesteaks from food trucks (and not the big, fancy food trucks that are becoming popular in this city, but from the ""roach coaches"") that were 100% better than Geno's (or the closely-related, possibly even run by the same people, cheesesteaks at Pat's). To find where I think you should get a great cheesesteak, you'll have to check out more of my reviews."
7101,9,3,1,4/25/2013,"Definitely a tourist trap, but who hasn't heard of the Hatfield's and McCoy's of the Philly Cheesesteak? I have only had Geno's, because my friend living in Philly told me that is where we go. ˜It was after a Rangers/Fliers game (NYR kicked some ice that night!) so I had already tied one on already. ˜ Wiz wit. The bread was bready and absorbed some of the booze flowing through my system that night. The meat was salty and also helped absorb some of my booze. The cheese was cheesy and was the perfect compliment to the rest of the sandwich. I think I mentioned that I was drunk, but that made this sandwich that much more heavenly. ˜ Why the three stars? ˜I came back sober on another day, and tried the cheesesteak again. It was just meh. ˜It was good because I was hungry, but it was nothing spectacular. ˜Definitely more hype than quality, but I was part of the legend!"
7102,9,3,1,4/25/2013,"A must for any foodie in the Phialdelphia area is to compare the Titan's of Phialdlephia cheesesteaks. Here goes: For a purely objective taste test, I ate a Pat's steak and Gino's steak side by side simultaneously for direct comparison. Pat''s came out on top primarily because the meat is better and chopped vs. layered, and beats Gino's's by at least a full star. Did it again two years later and came to the same conclusion. For you non-believers, bring a friend and order one cheesesteak from both steak joints, split them so you have half from both. Try a bite of one then try the other, then do it again . If you still think Ginos is better you may need to have your taste buds examined. It makes sense that Gino's needs the glitz in a desperate attempt to pull people away from Pat's."
7103,9,1,1,4/25/2013,"Let me start this review off by stating the ONLY thing Genos does better than Pat's: being friendly. That aside, Pat's is superior in every way conceivable. The steaks at Genos are super dry, the meat is poorly cooked and cut, and the place is just as dirty (Yet again, we're talking about South Philly). Genos sucks. Enough said."
7104,9,2,1,4/24/2013,This is the epitome of a tourist trap. Try Tony Luke's instead.
7105,9,2,1,4/23/2013,"I've lived in Philly long enough to know that Geno's is a low quality, overly greasy cheesesteak. ˜Unless you're starving and walking by it, don't bother. ˜There are a ton better places for a cheesesteak in the city."
7106,9,3,1,4/23/2013,"Nothing to add that hasn't already been said before. I tried the taste test of both Geno's and Pat's with a ""wit with whiz"", aka with onions and cheese whiz. I preferred Pat's. Geno's roll was a bit spongy rather than toasted. The meat was whole slices rather than shredded. Plenty of Whiz. Onions were nicely done. Seating was a challenge but that's the same at both places. It was A-OK. I'll take Pat's."
7107,9,4,1,4/21/2013,"The lines are outrageous, but the cheesesteak makes that OK. Have your CASH ready and be willing to answer the million-dollar question: ""Wid?"" See ""South Philly Accent"" for more information on that. Good sandwich for about $8."
7108,9,2,1,4/20/2013,"Disappointing. ˜Meat didn't taste great and wasn't chopped enough. ˜Pat's (across the triangle) was better, but both were disappointing. ˜Save your ""wit/witout, wiz, onions and peppers"" requests for Jim's steaks or one of fifty+ other places around. ˜These tourists traps are simply for tourists."
7109,9,2,1,4/19/2013,"On par w/ Pat's. Slightly different experience but same overall result. It's below Jim's Steaks. For those not from Philly, if you want to experience the philly cheese steak, start w/ the best one. Neither Pat's or Geno's have quality steaks. Think about it, it's open 24 hours, and the steaks are pretty much pre-made."
7110,9,1,1,4/19/2013,"It's gross and they're prejudiced people. If you have to get a cheesesteak, go to Jims."
7111,9,2,1,4/17/2013,"If you're reading this review, this is a comparison (and the same review for Pat's Steaks, Ishkabibbles, Jim's Steaks, and Geno's). ˜ I came to Philly with, what I believe are, pretty realistic expectations regarding cheesesteaks. ˜Yes, I knew coming into it that Genos and Pats were tourist traps and that their might be better cheesesteaks elsewhere throughout Philadelphia. ˜But at the end of the day, after trying four different places, a cheesesteak is a cheesesteak and it didn't really live up to the hype at all. ˜With that said, and amongst the 4 places, I would have to rank these in the following order: 1) Jim's Steaks (3 stars): ˜Best place to sit and eat. They had the largest dining area with an upstairs area. ˜It was not air conditioned though. ˜As for the cheesesteaks, it was the best in terms of flavor, service, bread consistency. Bread wasn't too chewy or hard.I had it prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions) and mushrooms. ˜Better service than Geno's and Pats. 2) ˜Ishkabibbles (solid 2.5 stars, maybe 3): ˜Very comparable to Jim's but there's absolutely no where to sit with the exception of 6 barstools. ˜ The gremlin drink is overrated too...but I had to try it. ˜I had it wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and mushrooms. ˜Better service than Geno's and Pats. 3) ˜Geno's (1.5 stars due to lack of smiles/service, but I'll round up to 2 for the hype and flourescent lights): ˜I like the bread but the meat was pretty flavorless. ˜Meat was in big slices and not chopped up. ˜I had it both with wiz/wit (cheese wiz and onions) and prov/wit (provolone chesse and onions). ˜This was, by the way, the first place I tried. ˜They have outdoor seating so if it's cold, it's not the best place to eat there. ˜ 4) ˜Pat's (solid 1.5 stars. ˜I won't round up to 2 since it's the least favorite of the four places): ˜The bread is softer and the meat definitely had more flavor than Geno's. The meat was chopped up. ˜BUT it was sooooo greasy that it gave me an upset stomach. ˜I had it with prov/wit (provolone cheese and onions). ˜They also have outdoor seating only. ˜ All in all, and if I'm in Philly again, I'm going to try Tony Luke's, Campos, Dalessandro's, and maybe a street vendor next time. ˜ BOTTOM LINE: ˜Skip the hype at Genos and Pats. ˜One of them may have started the cheesesteak craze, but the other establishments have made it better. It's time for Genos and Pats to catch up to the 21st century. ˜Word of advice to Genos and Pats: ˜SMILE and appreciate your customers!"
7112,9,1,1,4/16/2013,crap steaks and worse service all because they're over-hyped. ˜Never again.
7113,9,4,1,4/15/2013,"Here's the deal. ˜Is it the best Philly cheese steak that I have ever had? Prolly not, but is it worth a visit and be part of the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's? Absolutely. ˜ It's a good sandwich with lots of flavor and it packs a lot of history and tradition into their sandwich. I prolly wouldn't eat here everyday if I were a local but as a tourist, it was a novel experience to wait in line and experience what the fuss was all about. The hype was definitely part of the enjoyment. So if you're in town, go for it. ˜Yeah, you're gonna wait in a long line and pay $9 for a sandwich, but it'll be worth it. At the very least, it'll be a good Facebook check in."
7114,9,2,1,4/14/2013,Food: 3.5 Service: 1.5 Value: 2
5771,9,3,1,4/12/2013,Since I was in Philly I couldn't leave without trying both Pat's and Geno's Steaks. So I got the cheesesteak with Provlone but I should have gotten the cheese whiz one. It was ok I liked the roll it was on. The staff is real serious like no smiles and all about business. The service was fast. They take cash only. Sorry but I have to say Pat's was better. But I say try both and see for yourself. So now I have to try Jim's and Tony Luke's on my next visit to Philly.
7115,9,2,1,4/11/2013,"I came here and then tried Pat's afterwards for a taste test. Both are about the same price for a cheese steak, $9. It is a good size here, about 9 inches. However, the sandwich was a disappointment. The meat itself was very bland. The bread was also too thick. I threw away a piece of the sandwich before I finished it. A couple other observations that are not necessarily good or bad: They put more onions here than Pat's and the cheese whiz is more watery."
7116,9,1,1,4/10/2013,"You have got to be kidding me! How in GOD' s name did this place end up on ""Philly's best cheese steak list""? Both Pat's and Geno's steaks are AVERAGE at best! I've found PLENTLY of better cheese steaks spots around the city. Go looking...you'll be suprised. These places are hanging on to a historic reputation that draws a crowd of tourist. Do yourself a favor...go to Max's in north philly...or even Jim's on south street if you want a REAL good cheese steak! Thank me later :)"
7117,9,1,1,4/9/2013,"When I was a medical student in the city of brotherly love. ˜My friends and I would debate whether Pat's or Geno's had better cheese steaks. ˜For me it was not even a contest. ˜ I really had a problem ˜with Geno's. ˜I didn't care how good people say it was.....

""This is America, order in English,"" ""This country is being ruined by those who could not have built it."" "" I am mad as hell I want my country back."" Get real! ˜ This is the 21st century.

7121,9,3,1,4/3/2013,"This is the same review as what I gave for Pat's. We stopped by and got one from each Pat's and Geno's. Long story short: If you gave me sliced beef, cheese, and some long bread, I can make a cheesesteak as good as Geno's. I'm not kidding at all. There are some basic, simple foods that various restaurants have proclaimed to have the ""best"" or ""original"" and, whenever I have tried, I have responded with a big ""meh"". The reality is the gap between ""good"" and ""world's best"" for relatively simple foods like burgers, cheesesteaks, ramen, grilled cheese sandwich, mac and cheese, etc. is just not that huge. Sure, someone can use USDA prime aged ribeye for the sliced meat in their cheesesteak and it would be better, but why would you slice $15-20/lb prime aged ribeye to use in a cheesesteak? Why wouldn't you eat it as a ribeye steak? Likewise, you can use prime aged ribeye ground up for a burger, but what kind of nutbag would you be to do that? As another reviewer noted, the generic cheesesteak chain you see in the food courts offer cheesesteak that's as good as Geno's, and maybe better in many cases. Don't buy the hype."
7122,9,2,1,4/2/2013,"Over-rated, no seasoning, and the bread was oily and stale. ˜This place is just hyped up by the food shows and tourists flock over here."
7123,9,4,1,4/2/2013,I was certainly worth the wait. ˜Even though the line was wrapped around the block it went very quickly. ˜Certainly representative of a real Philly cheesesteak. ˜If you're in the area it is definitely worth a look see.
7124,9,3,1,3/31/2013,"Good sandwich. Enjoyed the bread more than at Pat's, but the diced meat was not as good. More provolone from Geno's. Loses a star for ˜having near racist warnings posted by window, though."
7125,9,2,1,3/31/2013,"If one place could ruin my love of cheesesteaks, Geno's would be it. There was minimal meat, cheese, and onions. Geno's bread was slightly better than Pat's, but overall, it was lackluster. I also don't understand why you need to order fries at a separate window."
7126,9,1,1,3/30/2013,"At least I can say I ate here, but it was a waste of money. This place is a ˜tourist trap, ˜There was more bread than meat, nothing tasted seasoned. If I ever visit Philly Geno's would never get my money again."
7127,9,1,1,3/30/2013,"Making the decision to go here to eat instead of the adjacent Pat's (simply because of the ""we go to Pat's all the time so lets do Geno's this time"" syndrome) was a big mistake. The bread was super cold and tasteless as also was the meat. I think to pull off a super uncomfortable and inconvenient culinary experience for your customers and have them come again - you really have to have exceptionally/out of the world - knock it out of the park - quality. Geno's is no where near - expecially with a much better alternative nearby (Pat's). Going there was a big mistake - not gonna do it again - stickin to Pat's."
7128,9,3,1,3/28/2013,"First time in Philly and went to this place based on the reviews on Yelp. Pat's is right across the street. The sandwich was very good - I had the wiz and onions. ˜But you had to make a separate line for drinks and fries, it's cash only and by the time I got my drink and sat doen the sandwich was cool. ˜I'm sure piping hot would have been a lot better. ˜Overall, worth the trip."
7129,9,2,1,3/27/2013,"I was in Philly over the weekend for the NCAA tournament. Let me start by saying that Philadelphia is a beautiful city with so much to see, and do, and eat! However, I DO NOT understand why anyone in their right mind would send me to Pat's or Geno's to pay for a 9 dollar nasty, low quality, meat and cheese wiz sandwich. YUCK! The workers were pretty rude for a thursday night at 11pm with absolutely no one else around. Maybe they just have a sort of 'soup nazi' thing going on that ironically draws people in. Either way, it would work better if their sandwiches weren't dry with fat-tastic meat. I couldn't tell you which place was worse. Geno's was lit up like a neon cracked out Christmas tree that was obviously a gimmick to lure people in like moths to a flame. However, I should have looked at it more along the lines of deadly dart frogs whose bright colors mean, ""Beware, I'm poisonous"". I'm not a snooty foodie type of person, but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that if you receive your food wrapped up and ready to go WHILE you're still paying for it, than it's most likely going to be disgusting and painful the next day. This same post is on both Pat's and Geno's Yelp pages since they both are equally gross. I lost my faith in the so-called famous ""Philly Cheesesteak"" until we decided to try Jim's on South Street for our last night in town. I actually opted out and got a slice of pizza instead since my experience with cheesesteaks was so horrible. However, my friend from Reading, PA INSISTED that I take half of her sandwich, and I was really glad I did. Turns out there is such thing as a decent Philly Cheesesteak in the City of Brotherly Love. Thanks Jim's! Next time i'll steer clear of the tourist traps, and open my own trap at your restaurant instead."
7130,9,3,1,3/26/2013,I liked the bread better than Pat's but I didn't think the steak was all that flavorful and it was also tough. The staff was very friendly though!
7131,9,1,1,3/24/2013,"The joint seems more like a tourist attraction rather then a sandwich shop. The mushroom on my sandwich tasted like they came out of the can which was gross, the fries were similar to McDonald french fries just thin, but not as crispy. ""Hey! Be a Man! Do the right thing! Go across the street to Pat's!"""
7132,9,3,1,3/24/2013,"Pretty good, looked better than Pat's... But, Pat's stil won taste wise. Outdoor seating only. Kinda sucked during a cold night and your phillycheese getting cooled down quickly by the weather."
7133,9,2,1,3/24/2013,"PHILLY CHEESESTEAK CHALLENGE: PAT'S VS. GENO'S, PART II The Cheese: They recommend Provolone (less creamy and cheesy than Cheez Whiz). To keep it matched against Pat's I also ordered one with Cheez Whiz too and found their Wiz to be thinner and runnier. The Meat: Less meat, sliced thicker, lacked flavor even with the onions The Bread: Softer, believe it to be steamed. A little tough and chewy after steaming because it's Italian bread. The Service: Staff was very friendly and seemed to care. However, Geno's website offers the warning: ""Be prepared and know how to order, because the service is fast and the line keeps moving."" The Presentation: Sandwich is presented tightly wrapped - easy to carry around. The wrapper is bigger and non-porous. The Aesthetics: Their colors and neon signage was bold and inviting. Reminiscent of food vendors at a carnival. General appearance is cleaner and brighter The Slogan: Geno's says Pat's invented the steak sandwich but they perfected it! Which one won?

7134,9,3,1,3/23/2013,I enjoy geno's steaks. Where they stand out above the rest is there late hours. Living in south philly all my life I have bulit it in to my late late night routine. There is something about a 3am cheesesteak that always seems to hit the spot but during regular restaurant hours there are so many other better options available.
7135,9,2,1,3/23/2013,"For all the hype, just pretty average."
7136,9,2,1,3/9/2013,"ALL SHOW AND NO GO. perfect example of a place that is overly done up (las vegas lights & everything) & the food does not deliver. steak is super dry & not juicy at all. i only tried this place because my friend said it was on the food network or something. i'm from california & was so excited to have my first authentic philly cheesesteak & was sad to be so disappointed =( i liked the place across the street better, btw. also, that hot sauce definitely needed that caution sticker because they are not kidding hahaa. luckily i didn't wait in a line; i basically walked right to the window & ordered. if i did, i would have been pissed because the food is definitely not worth a wait. i give it two stars vs. one star because it could probably make a good meal after a drunken night at the club. everything tastes good when you're drunk."
7137,9,3,1,3/8/2013,The cheesesteaks here aren't bad but I'd rather go down the street to Pats. I felt like the steak here is a little too salty and also the political signs are kinda uncomfortable to look at. The signs are a little obnoxious. Its a good place to try but not somewhere I would eat at regularly.
7138,9,3,1,3/7/2013,"For Geno's Steaks 1177 review I will simply say it's a good cheesesteak but not worth the wait and there is really no place to sit and eat. My homemade cheesesteak is better and the couch very comfortable, more importantly I will not be assaulted for wearing my Rangers Jersey like this poor guy in the video nbcnewyork.com/news/loca? It's just a game!"
7139,9,2,1,3/6/2013,"When it comes to cheese steaks in the city, this place does not compete with some of the others. ˜Granted yes they are known world wide, but I would be if I dumped thousands of dollars into gaudy neon lights that can be seen from the international space station, and just happen to be directly across the street from another very well know cheese steak spot. ˜When you hear ""Pat's"" it's almost always followed by a ""Geno's."" ˜I feel as though there is a reason as to why Pat's is always mentioned first! ˜If you want a greasy slab of unchopped meat thrown on a roll, & dressed up with onions and cheese then go here. ˜There are so many other places in the city that put out a higher quality product. ˜This is a prime example of location being key!"
7140,9,2,1,3/5/2013,"Geno's has all the hype, but not all of the quality. ˜One of the fattier steaks in Philly, and I've had nicer service. Obviously, they still make a great philly cheesesteak but with all of the competition in the area, that is what brought them down to 2 stars. ˜Do yourself a favor and go to Pat's... or better yet, Jim's on South Street!"
7141,9,4,1,3/4/2013,"Geno's is good, but Pat's is definitely better. But try both and judge for yourself!!"
7142,9,3,1,3/4/2013,"I have been a loyal Geno's guy my whole life, but I have never had his competitor's product until yesterday. Yesterday I had a half of each a Geno's & a Pat's cheese steak, and split it with my brother. We ordered a Wiz without at both places. Geno's is not chopped and had more fat on it. It was also not as meaty! It was also kind of blah! ˜Price of a Geno's Wiz Without $9.00 Pat's was chopped up and I could taste the flavor! The rolls and the whiz were both a wash, both tasting just as good. Pat's Wiz without cost $9.50, I ˜guess the 50 cents was worth the flavor, when in the area the next time I am gonna go to Pat's King of Steak's to try a whole Wiz with and then I will make my final decision, but after yesterday I must say my loyalty is leaning towards Pat's. I must add that John's Roast Pork makes a far superior cheese steak, and that you should try theirs instead. Both Pat's & Geno's are riding on their reputation and is really just a big tourist trap. Seating is outside so make sure to dress accordingly, and to bring cash cause neither of the establishments accept plastic. ˜Also you order your sandwich at one window and drinks and fries at the other. I will give Geno's 3 stars and Pat's a 4! As do most yelpers."
7143,9,4,1,3/3/2013,"Ah, the famous who does it best. I definitely liked the cheesesteak here. I really wish they could have an enclosed awning during the winter, when i went it was FREEZING!"
7144,9,5,1,3/3/2013,"Geno's steaks is simply awesome. Every time I'm at pat's steaks, I go to geno's as well. Just like both spots, they know how to do cheese steaks right! Quick and speedy service, and the best time to go is on a cloudy day so their is absolutely no wait. A little on the pricier side for cheesesteaks, but totally worth every penny!"
7145,9,4,1,3/2/2013,"If you've not been to Philly--shame on you. You MUST visit this corner of Philly, as it's a piece of history that time forgot; one of the last in the US and in the world. This IS a BUCKET list place FOR ALL THE WORLD!! Even if your a veggie. ˜(See below) Yea 4 stars. Go at 1 AM. You'll get the best beef, best rolls and super clean place. And a seat. Go in the day and you get almost half the meat. So it'll seem bready. This is THE CLEANEST STEAK PLACE IN THE WORLD.........Joey RIP. VEGGIE ALERT!!!!! Hey if you're a veggie; Philly has always been nice to the meatless; Order the peppers, cheese, fried onions,sauce-- nice."
7146,9,5,1,3/1/2013,I'm a vegetarian and I liked it because they made me the best veggie sandwich
7147,9,3,1,2/26/2013,"Geno's get a 3rd star, only because Pat's was so bad. ˜ The meat actually had flavor, these was a good balance of cheese, meat, bread, and onions, a great big vat of cherry peppers and some seriously good cheese fries. ˜ Still nothing close the amount of hype for these two places, but Geno's was decidedly a step above the very so-so Pat's."
7148,9,2,1,2/25/2013,"Pat's was not that great, but man... Geno's was slightly worse. I honestly don't know what to really say here. If you're a noob to cheesesteaks, then by all means, come here and get a small piece of Philadelphia culture, otherwise, you know better than to avoid this parking hellhole, with overpriced (and comparably small) cheesesteak sandwiches. Precooked meat. There, that should be enough for you to avoid this place. Parking: Same as Pat's. Sucks balls. Price: Not worth it, plus cash only Wait: Still not worth it"
7149,9,2,1,2/25/2013,"1st off, don't review a place based on the establishment's political views. It's decidedly NOT racist to ask someone to order in English. That's a political statement. You may not agree w/ it, but that's not racist. Racist would be refusing to serve someone based on race, creed, etc. Go overseas & try not speaking the native tongue. Good luck. Down to business. Geno's used to be good, but for $9 for a freakin' cheesesteak, there should be about a 1/2 lb of steak on it. And since all the tourists come here, maybe the owner should put a better ""face"" on their product. Took my son here recently to have one (& we're Philly born & bred) just to do the whole Geno's vs Pat's thing......VERY disappointed. You want a premier Philly cheesesteak, go to Chubby's."
7150,9,3,1,2/24/2013,Good cheese steak. Kinda over-rated. Probably because I'm not a fan of cheese steak at all.
7151,9,3,1,2/24/2013,"Tasted good with cheese whiz, my date got provolone, so not good. Skip the fries. Poor service."
7152,9,1,1,2/22/2013,"The greatest thing about America is that you have the freedom to choose not to eat at a racist restaurant. I was excited about going to this place after seing it featured on TV, but now I can't because their Cheesesteak Sandwiches will taste too much like disgusting racism."
7153,9,2,1,2/20/2013,"Between Geno's and Pat's (right across the street from each other), Geno's is definitely our fav, but they weren't anything to write home about either. I'm really not sure what all the hype is about, honestly. We drove from Virginia out to Philly specifically to try authentic Philly cheesesteaks; I have to say, my next visit will not have anything to do with the cheesesteaks - I've gotten better locally. And DONT try to park out there - it's best to just take a cab and save yourself the hassle. If you're planning to eat there, go during warmer weather - the wind and cold are NO JOKE, BUNDLE UP!"
7154,9,2,1,2/20/2013,"I'm giving Geno's two stars because the description is spot on! Yes, I've had better! I had better from directly across the street at Pat's. Geno's steak is thinly sliced where as Pat's is chopped. They dont chop their onions as finely either. And my onions were barely grilled from there. All in all I would recommend Pat's over Geno's but if you're doing the tourist thing, you should try both just because...."
7155,9,4,1,2/19/2013,Had Pat's and walked across the street to try Geno's. They're both equally delicious with a softly toasted warm bread spread with cheese whiz and steak. I opted for onions but the onions at Geno's was cut thicker. Geno's steak is cut in thin slices where as Pat's is chopped up. So it's up to personal preference. (Posted Pics) Tip: Bring Cash
7156,9,4,1,2/18/2013,"I went here two years ago when I first visited Philly. We must have waited an hour or more that day, but it was totally worth it. So, my gf mentioned wanting to get a cheesesteak from Philly, and I knew a return visit was soon in order. With it being President's Day weekend, we both had Monday off, and since Sunday is a feast day in the Western church, I was allowed to eat meat. It was very cold and windy, which meant that the line was much shorter this time. I decided to get the provolone this time, but she went with a traditional philly and had it with whiz: trust me, go with the whiz (I mean, you are eating a cheesesteak, how much worse is adding whiz for you?). It was very cold, and there is no indoor seating, so we had to walk back to the car to eat. I've not had a cheesesteak from anywhere else in Philly, but Genos always has a bigger crowd and is freaking delicious. This is a must visit to anyone in the area."
7157,9,4,1,2/17/2013,"I've become determined to travel the US with my husband and do all the things they do on Food Fueds (except Barberton chicken because it's nasty and I can't stomach it.) Philly cheesesteaks has been high on the list and was the main reason we decided to get to Philly. We tried Geno's first, not looking up which one won mind you, because it had the longer line. As it started to snow, we waited outside, staring at tons of police badges from across the US as we waited. It is strange - these places do make you feel like an outsider once you get to the window with the whole 'wit or witout' (both places do this by the way) and barking the orders. The whole thing seems like a gimmick - the racism, the big boy attitude - and it's a part of the experience. If you don't like it, I say don't come here, it's part of who and what they are. And both this place and Pat's do it, just in different ways. Ordering is fine,food comes quick. You have to eat outside. We chose a cheesesteak with American and Provolone and onions (I wimped out on cheez wiz) and cheese fries. Both were pretty damn yummy - meat was easy to eat, flavorful, and well cooked. The cheeses were melted and yummy, and I quite loved the onions. The cheese fries were addicting - really crispy and the cheez wiz sauce was actually pretty good. I was a bit cold as I ate, but it was an easy meal to eat quickly. Overall, a good experience. But, it's true. Others have mastered the Philly cheesesteak elsewhere, and while good, it's probably not the best. But certainly, it's better than Pat's. I literally didn't even eat that. I brought it home to my dogs."
7158,9,4,1,2/17/2013,Genos was better than Pats Wouldn't drive to do it again but coming from DC made for an interesting trip.
7159,9,1,1,2/12/2013,"Last time I was here was 30 years ago or so, I'm a Jim's Steaks guy, but I wanted to try the Big 3 head to head over a few days. ˜I'll just say that Geno's came in a distant third and there are places in Seattle I would go for a cheese steak before returning to Geno's."
7160,9,3,1,2/11/2013,"I love the cheesesteaks here. The reason I like this better than pats is the bread. I think the bread at Geno's is much better. The cheese fries are delicious as well. Very crispy. The atmosphere at Geno's is nice, displaying a lot of pictures with celebrities and help out the locals. However, it is taken way too far at some points, especially when it comes to their personal immigrant agenda. Food is good; Owners not so much"
7161,9,1,1,2/10/2013,I'm born and raised in Philly so I have had my fair share of Philly steaks in my years. Personally a lot of true native Philadelphians are not big fans of Geno's (nor Pats) its a tourist area really. The steaks are way over greasy and not the best tasting. Not to mention you only get a few pieces of steak and get this big roll. They should add more meat to the steak. ˜Now since Geno's is on some food (tourist) channels you would think that some of the rude comments like speak English would be taken down. For heaven shake 70% of your patrons are tourist and from other countries (that think your steaks are good but NOT). It comes across as if the place is very racist. There is a way to show your honor and love for this country without disrespecting other countries. But needless to say locals typically go to Jim's (I prefer the original store in West Philly) or Max's Steaks in North Philly. Geno's will always be a tourist trap. Overall the food.....not so good.
7162,9,1,1,2/8/2013,"If I could zero star this I would. What was I thinking going there in the first place??? I got into a cab to eat there as it was a tourist hotspot against the advice of every local I know. Ordered only to realize it was the worst sandwich I have had in Philly. Then I started noticing the racism. Unreal. ""This is America, order in English"" ""Press 1 for English; Press 2 for deportation"" ""This country is being ruined by those who could not have built it"" Had I seen these before I would have saved myself the worst steak sandwich and not given them my money. The sandwich is sooo bad. And yes this review was written in English."
7163,9,3,1,2/5/2013,"The cheese steak is definitely good in its own way. ˜The meat, cheese, and onions were delicious. ˜The only thing separating this place from Pat's is the bread. ˜The bread here is like eating a cloud. ˜For my fatty taste buds I needed something more substantial. ˜My vote goes to Pats. ˜pwned!"
7164,9,3,1,2/5/2013,"Genos has a good sandwich, a sandwich I'd sit down and eat, enjoying every bite slowly. ˜The bread is a little firmer versus Pats, however Genos steak is better than Pats. ˜Over all good sandwich."
7165,9,2,1,2/3/2013,"Not impressed with this place!!! Don't even know why they feature it on tv really, that hungry for business. Not friendly at all first of all guess all the publicity gettin to their heads. The sandwich was greasy, cut of meat was horrible. The only thing I tasted was the cheez whiz cuddos to that which they don't make (store bought). I will pass on this one consider my $9 bucks a donation."
7166,9,1,1,1/31/2013,"I would just like to say Philly Cheesesteaks in PHILLY are not all they crack up to be (well at least at Geno's, I guess). The reputation precedes them, so I was expecting miracles. We tried Geno's, but our experience was less than satisfying. First you had to get your sandwich from one window and your fries from another. Even though the wait was extremely short, those precious seconds detract from the heat of your cheesesteak. What if the lines were long? What then? I may just not be familiar with the system. And then, the sandwich was a whopping $9. That seems like a bit much for what it was. It took me like one minute to consume my half (that could have been my extreme hunger or eagerness...doubtful). And finally, the quality was just not great. It was a measly sandwich with a tiny bit of meat, barely perceptible cheese, and rubbery soft bread. ˜This sandwich tasted like it was thawed from the freezer and just cooked. It was a true disappointment. Not worth the money or the hype."
7167,9,1,1,1/28/2013,"What a disappointment. In taste, quality, visual-appeal, hygiene, and customer service Pat's was dramatically better in every category as we tried them at the same time. ˜Why this place is famous at all completely confuses me."
7168,9,2,1,1/27/2013,"I trudged through snow-covered streets on my last day in Philadelphia to get to this place and as soon as I took a bite into my cheesesteak, I was disappointed. The meat is not of great quality and there was not a lot of it for the price tag ($9). ˜I also had a birch beer, which tasted fine. Note to those who have never been there: ˜the seating is only outdoors so if you are going in the wintertime, like myself (what was I thinking?), you must brave the cold while eating a sub-par sandwich. I really wanted to like this place, I made it a point to get there before I left but I was not that impressed. I've had better cheesesteaks from northern NJ pizzerias."
7169,9,1,1,1/23/2013,"We tried Genos and Pats at the same time. And Geno is not even close. It is needlessly overly greasy and their cut and quality ˜of meat is more skimpy and less tasty. It is overall nowhere near as tasty as Pats. Now I understand why they need a huge Neon sign to attract business. Not only that, but the owners are a bunch of racists and fear mongers. There are signs on the window that say ""This is America, speak English"", and there is also a poster that shows a police officer killed by -El Shabab hazul whatever, some Arabic sounding name is boldly displayed. I understand supporting cops killed in action but why the need to prominently display the killer's obviously Muslim-sounding name. To me, the reason was obvious, especially in conjunction with the other sign. So not only does their cheese-steak suck. But their morals do as well. I'll pass."
7170,9,2,1,1/21/2013,"I had to go through Philly bc I missed my flight to NYC so i decided to try this place out. Dont know what the hype is about, the meat was dry and not much flavor."
7171,9,2,1,1/19/2013,"Tried Pat's across the street and was so disappointed. Geno's had a line out to the street so I definitely thought it was ten times better than Pat's. I was annoyed that you have to order your cheese steak at a separate window than your fries and drink. I ordered a steak with provolone and onions, which was dry and no flavor at all. ˜I at least thought that I could get full from the fries but my 5 year old daughter said they taste yucky! My husband and I tried them and agreed with our daughter. I really looked forward to trying the 2 most popular cheese steak joints when I came to visit Philly but neither are worth the wait or money."
7172,9,1,1,1/18/2013,"I've always thought Gino's had the best steak sandwiches in Philly. (anywhere for that matter, other than my own kitchen).........BUT, and there's always a but......... they've really gone out of control with their prices. ˜$9 is totally rridiculous. ˜Not to mention, they put less meat than in the past. ˜I stopped going!!~!"
7173,9,2,1,1/17/2013,"Of all of the places in Philly to get a cheesesteak, Geno's ranks at the bottom of the totem pole. Sure they guys behind the counter can be assholes and soup nazi-ish, but that really doesn't phase me - that's just how it's always been. ˜I just don't think the food lives up to any of the hype whatsoever. Why not? ˜It's just not that great. ˜The rolls aren't half bad, I will give them that, but really, the thick slabs of beef just don't do it for me. ˜When I think of a classic cheesesteak it's got that chopped beef. ˜That's the whole schtick to the cheesesteak, so when you throw on those onions & cheese on the wok, they all just caramelize and infuse together, enveloping the meat. ˜This just doesn't happen to the meat with the thick slices of beef. Go ahead and do the tourist comparison with Geno's cross street competitor, but I'd recommend heading elsewhere for a better made and tasting cheesesteak."
7174,9,1,1,1/17/2013,"There are so many other good cheesesteak places in Philadelphia. One of my favorites is Saad's Halal Palace in West Philadelphia. They have great steaks, falafal, and phenomenal curly fries. Like many other reviewers have sait. GENO'S IS RACIST. It's not hard to see when they have stickers on their windows that say ""Press 1 for English, Press 2 for deportation"". Their food is meh. Their service is incredibly poor. The biggest thing about this place is their feud with Pat's across the street. Tons of other good small businesses to support in Philly with better food and better service. This place gives Philly a bad name in so many ways."
7175,9,2,1,1/13/2013,Very Little meat and not much flavor. The frys were bland as well. I rather go to Pat's.
7176,9,1,1,1/13/2013,This establishment is PROUD of being racist. Need I say more? Last time I checked this was the city of brotherly love...
7177,9,2,1,1/12/2013,"Wow, that was marginal. Was not worth the attitude or money. A true food factory though. From the time to order and get our subs three minutes. Great ""Philly"" cheesesteaks... the kiosks in front of Home Depot."
7178,9,2,1,1/12/2013,"Run of the mill, cheap steak sandwich is all I found at this tourist trap. I can't help but wonder what the hype is with this place. You can get a better cheese-steak in Providence, RI. I don't care if you go to Pat's or Geno's they are both terrible. Go to Tommy DiNic's and save yourself the disappointment of a poor quality meal."
7179,9,1,1,1/12/2013,"Geno's is for tourists. ""But Matt, I AM a tourist!"" you may say. ˜STILL, do not go there. Take a trip to the infamous corner where Geno's and Pat's square off if you must but do not give them your business. Go to Jim's on South Street for better quality or hit Steve's in the Northeast. They have guaranteed business from tourist saps and they know it. ˜Don't waste your time with them or Pat's."
7180,9,2,1,1/10/2013,"Pat's beat Geno's hands down! How is this even a competition?? Pat's is more flavorful, more moist, and I feel like it's got more meat to bread ratio. I had to add a bunch of hot sauce to Geno's sandwich just to finish it."
7181,9,4,1,1/10/2013,"As in all reviews, this review only reveals the observations of quality and conditions related to the dated visit. Observations may not be a full reflection of the establishments' day to day business, but comments should be taken into serious consideration when evaluating a business's ability to perform consistently which is paramount. They won the Best cheese-steak competition for a reason.....they are the best ""period""!"
7182,9,2,1,1/4/2013,"I'm paying for a ""meh"" cheesesteak, not obnoxious, small-minded, ethnocentric propaganda."
7183,9,2,1,1/4/2013,"its historical and all, but if you want a real steak go to Tony Lukes. Thats where it is at to get a philly steak"
7184,9,3,1,1/3/2013,"This place was far, far from what things happens. Ive herad that this was the best Philly Cheesesteake, so I had to try it. The terrible thing is that is winter, windy and huge lines. The pice was very expecive for the lack of cheese ( just 1 slice). I wouldnt go back there. ANd the sandwich was good, but wasnt as great as I was expecting, so...."
7185,9,5,1,1/3/2013,You have to stand in line and try this Philadelphia landmark...the sandwich was great and it was worth the wait...do yourself a favor and stop by...
7186,9,1,1,12/28/2012,"Tough, tasteless meat, stale bread, rude service and xenophobes... oh, and grossly overpriced. ˜Just stay away."
7187,9,4,1,12/27/2012,Loved them! I thought they were way better than pats! Everyone was friendlier and the cheesesteak tasted awesome! The bread was soft and delcious and plenty of great steak in the sandwich. I will be back when im back in town. Only reason 4 stars is the places in philly overcharge for cheese steaks in my opinion. 40 bucks for 3 cheesesteaks 2 fries and 3 drinks just seemed alittle pricey.
7188,9,3,1,12/27/2012,"We ordered Cheez Whiz Wit and a drink with fries. The fries were excellent, hot and crisp on the outside and mildly soft on the inside. Compared to Pat's', Geno's cheese steak was a bit oilier, toastier, and had a whole lot more onions. Let's just say Geno's redeemed the city for its cheese steaks."
7189,9,1,1,12/26/2012,"Back in the day, Geno's could teach Pat's & Jim's a thing or two, but no longer. Meager serving of meat, and not enough cheese to fill a recently-fed mouse. Skip it. There are two ways to say ""Tourist trap with Cheese Whiz and grilled onions"" the way the locals do. You can say ˜""Tourist trap, whiz wit."" Or you can simply say ˜""Geno's."" And a sandwich, drink and cheese fries is gonna set you back almost ˜twenty bucks. Barnum was right."
7190,9,2,1,12/26/2012,I was craving a good cheese steak so I went to Geno's and got a sandwich fries and drink. It was okay but not good. It was not as good as I had hoped and I love Cheese steaks. If you are in Philly try it out because it is a tourist destination. But I wouldn't come here again
7191,9,1,1,12/17/2012,"The service is horrible, the lady that took our order at the window was incredibly rude, I would never go back based on this. As far as the sandwich goes I thought it was overpriced for what it was and not very tasty. ˜The steak was extremely greasy and not very flavorful, the bread seamed almost stale, the only good part was the cheese. ˜This place is just a tourist trap, they don't make the sandwiches fresh they simply scoop the meat from a pile of precooked meat and put it on your roll. I would recommend skipping this place and going somewhere where the food is good and the servers are not incredibly rude."
7192,9,1,1,12/17/2012,"What a waste of time and money. ˜I'm 50yrs old and my friends from Philadelphia had told me all my life; hey we shold go to Geno's yadda yadda for years whenever I would visit. over the last 30years whenever the Grateful Dead would play the spectrum or other bands in nearby venues. ˜ I went yesterday with my girlfriend for the first time and it was the worst experience for food I have ever had. ˜I can make a better steak sandwich myself. ˜To be fair, the bread was ok. ˜But the grease bomb they serve is nothing but a long stay in the bathroom awaiting you several hours later. ˜Hey; I'm all for belly bombs (White Castle comes to mind) but it should be when expected not a result of hype and tasteless ""meat"" and a slop of carmalized onions. ˜Their frys, while proclaiming ""freedom"" are nothing but the cheapest frozen fry they can find and dump into uninspired oil. ˜I would never reccomend this place to anyone. ˜I'd rather go to Nathan's in coney island. ˜At least what they sell tastes good! (one last thing... what is up with that hot sauce? - it is not for the weak kneed - but man, ya gotta give warning on that - that is a present that re-presents itself upon expulsion as well)"
7193,9,2,1,12/17/2012,- ˜1 for rude staff - ˜1 because I've had better in NYC - ˜1 for ignorant signs + 1 for the bread + 1 because of Pat's across the street ( which is marginally better) Enough said.
7194,9,2,1,12/15/2012,"The cheapest white bread roll, poisonous cheese wiz, and apathetic, expectant employees. ˜ I'm eating a cheesesteak in the airport right now that is 100 times better!!!! Don't waste your time. Only redeeming value is that Geno supports the troops."
7195,9,3,1,12/15/2012,"Pretty good cheesesteak, way better than Pats across the street, I just don't like all the signs about you're in America speak English, and the fact that the workers aren't very polite and barely have a smile on their face, it's as if they hate their job and can't wait for you to get out of their face."
7196,9,5,1,12/13/2012,"Whenever we're hungry and its late, we hope in the car and head to Philly. Genos is open late and its delicious. Slabs of meat, whiz wit', a birch beer, and cheese fries. Can't get much better than that. Plus its a great go to place with the guys. I highly suggest it especially for first timers. Its a cool atmosphere to have your first Philly Cheesesteak. It has always kept me coming back for more. Sometimes theres a line, but it doesn't matter, the foods good enough in my mind."
7197,9,3,1,12/12/2012,I live kinda close... They know me when they see me and I know them. It's good for a once in a while fix.
7198,9,3,1,12/12/2012,"My brother decided that he wan'ted to drive to Philly and get a Philly cheese steak for his birthday. So we ended up at this place. I am not a native philly person, so I am not sure where the best philly steaks are. The one I ordered was good to me. They use cheese whiz and it was yummy."
7199,9,2,1,12/11/2012,"I'm not a huge fan of cheesesteaks to begin with. I'll steal a bite or two from a friend every once in awhile, but I eat one of my own probably once a year. On those rare occasions that I do want one, this is not where I go. It's a tourist attraction, and thats about it. Your local pizza shop probably has better cheesesteaks. Geno's is okay to try once, for the experience. Honestly, its been so long since I've actually eaten here that a barely remember the cheesesteak, but I do recall there was a significant amount of gristle. Also, the place is an eyesore. Neon lights, obnoxious orange, a cluttered mess of photos....not to mention the blatantly racist stickers near the ordering window. ""Press 1 for English, 2 for deportation."" Even if they had the best sandwiches on earth, I would not eat here again."
7200,9,3,1,12/11/2012,"Not as good as Pats. The bread was a little dry but ample cheese. Great carmelized onions. Short line on a rainy Friday night, worth the trip for a legit philly cheesesteak though!"
7201,9,2,1,12/9/2012,"Walked from 1628 Chestnut street, all the way down 9th just so I could experience the two rivals. The walk was interesting, started with nice brick apartments, and gradually into the Hispanic section, with shops extended to the streets. Ghetto woodwork shelving, dirtyish streets with a hint of ghetto aesthetics. ˜Reminded me of Chinatown, NY with a twist. I saw a taco/fajita place right before Genos and I wish I stopped there, it looked good. Genos looks great with all the lights changing color and pictures all over. Clean, big windows and great view of the inside where all the tatted up guys worked. I asked the lady if they took cards and the guy next to her chuckled. Darn, could not expense it. That was not going to stop me because it was Genos and Pats back to back night. I waited for around 5-8 minutes and several people walked up to order. Then an Asian family with kids rolled up ready to munch. I got the provolone, steak and onions. Large amount of steak and onions. It was nothing crazy but it was good to say the least. The bread was a bit stiff, seemed pretty generic. Towards the end of the cheesesteak, my mouth was a bit tired from the munching. Tell you the truth, I was a bit intimated to take pictures of the kitchen. Felt like I was going to get wacked. I did anyway! Time for Pats"
7202,9,5,1,12/7/2012,"Best Philly Cheesesteak ever!!!! Went here & my family's friend took us here. We stood in a crazy line, but it took us only like 10 minutes to get the cheese steaks.... Greasy but SOOOO damn good!!!! We wanted to come back for more"
7203,9,2,1,12/4/2012,"***TOURIST TRAP*** I was a tourist, saw the familiar sign, and HAD to see what all the fuss was about. After about 45 minutes of waiting in a line around the corner I order my cheesesteak with whiz. Immediately I think ""Thats all?"". Kinda small, not much meat, a little bland. Theres an hour of my life I'll never get back... YOU OWE ME GENO!!! I know Pat's across the street may be a trap too, but their sandwich is bigger, about $.50 cheaper, looks better, and the line is shorter. Just saying..."
7204,9,3,1,12/4/2012,"It was okay. ˜It wasn't as good as I thought it'd be, especially for $9. ˜I really liked the cheese fries, but they were slightly odd. ˜This place is pretty over-priced, but seems like a great place for a late-night snack. ˜I would've definitely loved to try another place."
7205,9,1,1,12/4/2012,"First off, i'm glad to see the reviews have come down on this place. ˜I remember looking a few years ago when i was first going to do the philly cheesesteak thing and being pretty excited. ˜Same review below as for Pat's, since they are just the same sh*t, different toilet. Complete trash. ˜If you've ever eaten a cheesesteak in your life, avoid this place. ˜Just a tourist trap and hype machine. ˜Quizno's makes a much better cheesesteak. ˜In the question of pat's vs geno's, the answer is, who f*cking cares? ˜They both suck. ˜Went here 2 years ago with my brother. ˜Needless to say, i was excited, cuz i love food and heard so much about these two places. ˜I took a bite, looked at him, and started laughing. ˜Same with geno's, though. ˜I figured maybe i was mistaken, so i have gone back every time i've gone to philly for a concert or something (live in DC). ˜Nope. ˜Eaten here three or four times. ˜Wish i had my $30 back, so i could buy a grenade and blow the two places up. Maybe if i was blackout drunk."
7206,9,1,1,12/3/2012,Tourist trap. small greasy steaks
7207,9,2,1,11/28/2012,Really not that great. Staff isn't rude... But not nice. Steaks are ok. And the neon racism is just un called for.
7208,9,1,1,11/28/2012,"What the what?!?! This place is horrible, they cant even be bothered to saut? onions correctly! I've seen leather on shoes that looked more appealing than the beef on this steak was.. Also, what the hell is up with all the attitude?!?! You didn't invent the wheel; you're making a glorified sandwich that you're selling out of a window on a street corner, ACT LIKE IT! Once the buzz dies down and the TV crews stop coming, I predict this place will go the way of the dodo bird.."
7209,9,2,1,11/27/2012,"I was so excited to visit Philly and experience an amazing Philly Cheese steak. But Geno's didn't do it for me. It was just OK, but I'm sure their are other cheese steak places that are way better. I added a bunch of hot sauce and hot peppers on top of my cheese steak to give it flavor. Either way I was excited to visit Philly for the first time and watch my first eagles game; so I had a good time at Genos. There wasn't any lines and enough seats to sit and enjoy my cheese steak. Next visit I might go across the street to Pats and see that all the fuss is about other there. Until next time Philly!"
7210,9,1,1,11/27/2012,Would rather rate this place a zero!! One word - TASTELESS!! Don't waste your time and money coming here .. Pat's is by far a better place hands down.
7211,9,1,1,11/27/2012,"If you want an overpriced, blend and most of all sh!tty cheese steak this is the place to go. Also RACIST, XENOPHOBIC and HOMOPHOBIC. Sorry for the all caps, just wanted to give everyone a fair warning. Wooohoo!"
7212,9,3,1,11/26/2012,"Geno's was good. ˜Not the best that I had but pretty decent. ˜I've tried Jim's already and on my next Philly trip, I look forward to sample Pat's, Max's, Tony Luke's, Philip's, Nick's, Steve's, Dalessandro's, etc, etc.... So many guys, so little time....(sigh)"
7213,9,3,1,11/26/2012,"Well I went to have a Cheese Steak Sub at the Infamous Geno's. It was OK. I'm not a fan of the Cheese Whiz on my sandwich but it was not bad but it was not something to write home about either. To me it was more the factor of "" Yeah I'm""m eating a Cheese Steak in South Philly at Geno's""!!! I have had better Cheese Steak Subs in the Northeast that where bigger, cheaper, & fresher."
7214,9,4,1,11/23/2012,"Tried the original cheesesteak with wiz. Meat was less tough and juicier than Pats. Genos, you win. ˜Eh, 4 stars is still being generous though. 3.5."
7215,9,2,1,11/23/2012,"There was no line here when I went around 9PM on a Friday night. I thought there would be a crowd, but the tables were busy. I ordered a Wiz wit.. The cashier (an old lady) seemed nice. The steak sandwich was given to me quite quickly. The steak sandwich was ehh good and bad. The good was the onions and wiz. I mean i ˜guess you can't go wrong with wiz, but the onions were cooked to perfection. They were diced, but not minced to small, and they had a great white hue to them with a hint of translucency,. They were not overcooked at all, so they still packed a nice onion flavor and a nice bite for texture. The steak was pretty dry though. They are thin slices (not chopped). I mean the cheesy wiz could not help keep the sandwich moist as the meat was pretty dry; Overall the sandwich was yummy, and the onions were great but I've had better."
7216,9,4,1,11/22/2012,"My first trip to Philadelphia, came here to get the cheese steak. One of the best sandwiches I had, even though it was rather greasy."
7217,9,1,1,11/21/2012,Pass on this one. Find a street vendor.
7218,9,3,1,11/21/2012,It was ok. Definitely better with the wiz instead of provolone.... the cheese melts into gooey goodness. Pat's & Geno's are ok but way over-hyped.
7219,9,2,1,11/20/2012,"Yes, Philadelphia is the home of the cheese steak. And cheese steaks can frankly be delicious. But I've been here several times and the cheese steaks really just aren't that great. The bread, fantastic. But the meat has been dry and flavorless. I walked across the street and to the other restaurant, you know, Pat's. And it's not any better. In fact they taste almost exactly the same. You can find better cheese steaks elsewhere. Now I'm not saying it needs to be made from filet mignon with Gruyere. But if you get the combination of fresh bread, flavorful meat, and real cheese, you'll have a good product, it doesn't need to be from South Philly. Now where to find that..."
7220,9,2,1,11/19/2012,"I first heard of Geno's through a travel channel special that was on while I was working out at the gym. I know, it really doesn't make much sense to be working out and then watching something that makes you feel like you just gained some weight and clogged your arteries, even from just watching it on tv. Nothing says, ""eat me"" like a perfect combination of grease, cheese, and steak on toasted bread! It was then I decided that the next time I set foot in Philly, I needed to come see this place firsthand. Throughout the television special, I was intrigued by the rivalry that is Geno's vs Pat's. After my workout, I knew that I needed to decide for myself, which cheese steak place reigns supreme?! Since I was in town for the weekend to visit my best friend and I just recently saw this special on tv, I knew this was something I could finally cross off my Philly bucket list. This cheese steak joint is a hard sight to miss because it looks like something that escaped from fabulous Las Vegas with all the neon lit signs that remind you that you're at Geno's. With Pat's just a few feet away, it just makes it more fun to experience this Philly rivalry. As you walk up to the window to place your order, you become overwhelmed with a sense of pride for the police and fire departments all over with the wall of PD / FD patches decorating one of the walls. That's pretty awesome because these people deserve a lot of respect for protecting our citizens and keeping us safe. However, there is a racist sticker near the window where you order. ""Press 1 for English. Press 2 for Deportation."" Take it how you may, but I guess... it adds character to the place? Whatever. I came for Cheese steak. Not for someone's opinions of immigration in the United States. As I looked at the menu, I was disappointed that the only options you had for your cheese steak were three types of cheese. Maybe I should have also tried the fries, I hear they're awesome. When I finally took a bite of my Philly Cheese Steak, I was a little underwhelmed. I was expecting my cheese steak to be piping hot but instead it was warm. I just anticipated it to be oozing with all sorts flavor. It wasn't bad, but I guess I was expecting more because of all the hype, the line you can see snaking around the corner and celebrity endorsements (you can see the celebrity photos plastered like wallpaper along the ceiling). In the back of my head, I already knew that this was a tourist trap but I'm still glad I got to try a Philly Cheese Steak at the famous Geno's Steaks. I think it's a must if you're coming to visit. I look at coming here as more of an experience, since I don't regularly crave Philly Cheese Steaks. I know which I prefer more, but decide for yourself if you're a Geno's or Pat's fan."
7221,9,2,1,11/14/2012,"You'd think with all of that flash they'd have some amazing untouchable steak-not true. Used to have it a few years back and it was pretty good. But had it in September and it didn't taste good at all. The place is pretty overrated and I spent more time picking the fat off of the meat than eating it. Honestly, didn't taste great."
7222,9,1,1,11/13/2012,"This is the epitome of tourist trap. Pat's has at least a passable product. Geno's is the pits. Bad chewy meat, not enough cheese, and a heaping serving of xenophobia."
7223,9,2,1,11/9/2012,"It would be possible to do worse with a little bit of constructive effort, so Geno's is getting a 2. ˜Having said that, there is no compelling reason to ever eat here. Let's start at the foundation. The thick bread is less memorable than muzak--just another mildly-stale tube of simple carbs to gunk up your mouth. The fillings, such as they are, impress even less: five pieces of concrete-colored steak with the texture of a mouse pad, a few sweaty squares of onion, and a watery trail of synthetic cheese lube. This would have been more of a textural nightmare if the scant portions hadn't been completely overwhelmed by the cloud of bread. Strangely, the ensemble needed salt, which might have helped the steak taste less like dirty water. Insufficient salt, you stammer incredulously? Insufficient salt at a dive restaurant that depends on the dollars of airheaded tourists like Ray L? Friends, I speak the truth. To the best of my knowledge this has never happened before. Anywhere. Bad restaurants always over-salt... making Geno's is unique in at least one regard. We probably don't need to waste time discussing the price. Actually, I take that back: a sandwich this bad should come wrapped up in $20s to console the hapless diner. The actual $9 price tag is egregious. If you want a similar experience with better karma, give your $9 to a homeless person and then go eat the raincoat in your closet."
7224,9,1,1,11/8/2012,Complaints: ---Upon receiving the sandwich bread is soggy already ---The ˜thinly slice beef is tasteless along with tiny amount of beef ---the cheese whiz is water down. If you ever mix water with cheese you will get a water down lumpy substance. This is how the cheese whiz looks and taste. ---they are very rude! If their are so miserable there why don't they just hired someone to work for them then. Why is it a tradition to waste money and time eating horrible food. They must know your not coming back hence thats why their rude. I've observed them with others while waiting and they treat everyone like that. If you really have to have a cheesesteak since your there already go to Pats. It's not the best but comparable to Genos it taste way better. Don't say I didn't warn you.
7225,9,5,1,11/8/2012,"I love genos. I know it isn't the best cheesesteak in Philadelphia but the atmosphere makes up for it. You drive down a crowded, busy street and have to fight for a parking spot. The rival, Pats, which I don't care for too much, is right across the street and some days it's fun to compare steaks or even the size of the line waiting for one. My go-to steak is a ""Wiz Wit"", cheese wiz and fried onions. Ketchup and peppers make for an excellent steak. The steaks come out almost seconds after ordering. Then you get to sit at tables full of pictures of celebs and all around Philadelphia people just make the whole day fun."
7226,9,1,1,11/7/2012,"$9 for a sub that aint even overstuffed. I wish my husband wouldve took a picture of that ish because my opinion is that it is overrated and overpriced. ˜ 2 pieces of thinly sliced meat with something that look like nacho cheese slathered on the bread. ˜The guy who was manning the grill had a whole heaping of meat, grilled onions on the grill but that was a damn tease---that ish aint got no meat on it for $9. ˜What the ish is that all about? $9 damn well at least give me a few ounces of meat. Walk up service. ˜You want fries, go down to the other window. ˜I have to say that the place is super clean but sorry Geno's -- you aint it."
7227,9,3,1,11/6/2012,"Its a basic Philly Cheesesteak...BUT I gotta say...Pats wins for me. The bread is good. and so are the fries, but...I prefer to go somewhere else now. I guess I can be a bit more touristy and try Tony Lukes. I kind of rather try a hole in the wall spot....or stay in NY and grab a cheesexteak in the city would work too. They're good but nothing special, although its fun to have the ""Yoooo lets go to Philly and get cheesesteaks mini road trip"" I'd rather wait on the line across the street, just sayin!"
7228,9,4,1,11/6/2012,"Came here the other day while on a weekend trip to visit my brother in collge. I have had other cheesesteaks during previous trips to Philly, but I don't recall them too much, because I was very young at the time. After being referred to about a dozen places by co-workers and friends, I decided to go with Geno's, since it's one of the two staples in the city besides Pat's. Overall, I was very pleased with my cheesesteak! I ordered a ""mushroom wiz, wid out"". The meat came in whole, thin slices that was in even proportion to the bread. There were plenty of mushrooms on top, which I love! To me, having the Whiz on the sandwich made it all complete. About the decor, the place screams ""tourist destination"" with it's bright lighting and many pictures of famous people. Also of note, the badges of many municipalities across the United States are posted on the walls as well. I was delighted to see a badge for Ossining Police. Next time I'm in Philly (which I'm sure will be sooner than later), I will make sure I go to AT LEAST two other eateries, including Geno's rival, Pat's."
7229,9,1,1,11/3/2012,"PLEASE go to 'by george' in the reading terminal market! ˜better service and food, no rude person taking your money and you can use a bathroom! ˜FU cash register window lady...so rude to everyone!"
7230,9,1,1,11/1/2012,"Not as good as Pat's but these are both TERRIBLE. I'm from California (born and raised) and I can't believe I came here to try this even with advice from a recent local. I actually expected the sandwich to be larger. I expected the meat to be much more tender than what I had. I can't believe this was on TV and mentioned as one of the best in the USA. In my opinion, it's a complete waste and people that actually like cheesesteaks here don't know anything about food. My advice to tourists: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. Go elsewhere. Go to Dinic's which is totally worth the wait and $."
7231,9,3,1,10/28/2012,"It seems everyone does the taste test comparison between Geno's and Pat's because they're across the street from each other, so why not? ˜Based just on the Cheesesteak, Geno's edges out Pat's. It's assembly line style ordering and pick-up. ˜You order on the street, you pay and eat outside, and get your condiments off the sidewalk. ˜That should tip you off that the service is nonexistent, so deal with it. The bread at Geno's is a chewy and soft baguette packed with thin whole sheets of steak, chunky onions with a glassy sheen and your choice of American, Provolone or Cheez Wiz. ˜It feels more substantial and juicier when the steak is whole, not cut into shreds, and though it could stand a little seasoning, it's actually the cheese and bread that gives the sandwich its body and flavor. By the way, the signage here is vaguely offensive. ˜""I want my country back"" is one such gem. ˜Back from what? ˜Someone should have told the owners that there's no room for politics in cheesesteaks."
7232,9,4,1,10/25/2012,"We just had to go to Geno's after a trip to Pat's for comparisons sake after a pretty disappointing cheesesteak wit whiz and onions. Geno's doesn't have as many options as Pat's, but what they lack in options, they more than make up for in flavor! Geno's slices their meat, which is a new concept to me when it comes to cheesesteaks. ˜I thought I'd prefer the diced meat on the grill better since it intermingles with all the other fixins, but I was wrong. ˜Whatever Geno's does with their meat, they sure do it right! ˜ The cheesesteak also had more gooey whiz and much, much more flava! Geno's wins hands down when it comes to the staple Philly cheesesteak. ˜ Oh and just on a side note: these two establishments take their rivalry seriously. I saw a Pat's patron attempting to load her cheesesteak up with some condiments at Geno's and was quickly heckled (in unison) by an army of Geno's employees. So save yourself the embarrassment and get your condiments at the joint you purchase from!"
7233,9,4,1,10/25/2012,Yummy steaks and soft bread...I like the cheese and effeciency of the workers making my sandwhich.Its not gourmet its a steak shop and they taste great
7234,9,4,1,10/24/2012,"My favorite parts are 1.the line is long but moves fast, 2.the people working there move fast, 3. their cheesesteaks are the best in Philly, and 4. YOu must order in ENGLISH!!!!!"
7235,9,1,1,10/21/2012,"Geno's has lost the cheesesteak battle against Pat's ... - Rude cashier-folks - Bad tasting cheesesteak (bland meat, no taste in cheese) - Clean(er) environment than Pat's - Okay pricing for size Revisit? ˜Not I."
7236,9,4,1,10/19/2012,"Before coming to Philly, the closest I've had to cheesesteaks were the ones from Costco that you heat up in the microwave for a minute and BOOM! Yes I know there are cheesesteak places here in CA too but I really wanted my first time from philly. YEP! Tried both this place and the other place. I like the provolone cheesesteak here better than Pat's. The wiz wit here was pretty tasty. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the bread... a bit tough for me but regardless the melty cheese can soften it a bit. Service is quick (and intimidating especially for first timers) and thankfully their website had instructions on how to order so you don't hold up the line. Verdict: this place is great! Brightly lit to attract the customers and tasty. YUM ;P"
5110,9,4,1,10/16/2012,"They are pretty racist here but they make good cheesesteaks. It's a must-see for when you have people in town visiting. I suggest getting one at Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's and debating the pros and cost of each. Make sure you train your guests in how to order so they don't get overwhelmed."
7237,9,1,1,10/16/2012,"Horrible! I was so upset that I wasted my hard earned $ @ this wretched place! Especially after I saw all the racist signage posted all over the place. Besides that the food was terrible and the woman at counter was so RUDE. I can't believe this place is ""famous"". Why???? Prob cause its cheap and open late."
7238,9,3,1,10/11/2012,We drove to South Philly and tried both Geno's and Pat's steaks. ˜Though I think Geno's is ok Pat's just had the better cheese steak. ˜My opinion is that the cheese was definitely better at Pat's.
7239,9,4,1,10/10/2012,"Many steaks later this is my first time here. Compared to all of the others, Geno's is just as good. The rolls are not as good as Tony Lukes but they make up for it with mucho meat! Go eat one!"
7240,9,3,1,10/9/2012,"travelled through philly on the way to a soccer tournament. ˜stopped by for some cheesesteak -- wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. friendly service, perhaps because we got there when there were NO lines. ordered whiz wit. ˜it was good, although a bit greasy and the cheese just stayed on the surface of the meat, between the bread and cheese. ˜meat is sliced, not chopped. i wouldn't travel all the way to philly for another cheesesteak, it was something you can get at the mall in any other city."
7241,9,1,1,10/5/2012,"I wish I could give this place zero stars. Not only was their Philly cheesesteak disgusting, their tacky, ignorant signage was absolutely vile. I am so upset that I didn't see the horrible racist stickers until I actually bought the damn sandwich (bread was stale and hard, meat was dry and bland, provolone was virtually non-existent, I had to douse mine in ketchup and salt to choke it down, shoulda just saved myself the calories and thrown it out). Please do not patronize this awful ""establishment"". We went to pats afterwards, though it costs fifty cents more, I suggest u do the same, the bread is softer and the meat actually has flavor. They obviously don't need the negative publicity and tacky signage Geno's relies on to make money. Note to self: always always check yelp before deciding where to eat!!"
7242,9,2,1,10/5/2012,Very touristy but a fun experience.
7243,9,4,1,10/4/2012,My husband and I did our own food test between Pats cheesesteaks and Geno's cheesesteaks. Geno's was much better the meat was more flavorful and it was just a much better cheesesteak than Pats.
7244,9,3,1,10/3/2012,"Yep, my first trip to Philly, I had to come and visit the landmark cheesesteak battleground. Since I was with family, we decided to split up and attack both places separately, meet up and share once we had some grub in our hands. Mom and I headed to Geno's. I really dig the decor, colors and vibe. It felt like Philly to me. It was lunch time, but not too crowded, just steady. I ordered two provvy ""wit."" At 9 bucks a steak, I was hoping for a hit. The best things about the steaks were definitely not the steak. The wrapping paper had more flavor than the meat. Yet, the bread was very fresh, crisp outside, soft inside, and the onions had a perfect saute. They weren't finely chopped, rather a nice big dice on 'em. I love onions that way. I think next time I'll order the whiz cheese b/c the provvy didn't do it for me. Great story to prove the cheesesteak feud is truly real. My mom forgot to have me order mushrooms for her steak. So, she took her Geno's steak in 'the other place's' wrapper since we were sitting at the competitions table and eating their fries (which RULE, btw) and walked up to their window to order some 'shrooms. I repeatedly said, ""don't do it!"" Alas, she didn't listen. One whiff or glance at the sandwich in her hand and they yelled ""that ain't our steak, and we ain't puttin' our mushrooms on it!"" Poor mom's ruse never stood a chance."
7245,9,2,1,10/2/2012,"I had a pretty good idea of what to expect from the most famous steak and cheese grinders in the country and it turned out to be exactly as expected. What you basically have is a bunch of grumpy people, tired of dealing with tourists, who use an assembly line to mass produce a product using low quality ingredients. Cheese whiz and steak-umms....yum. They then charge you $9 for the experience. The fact that the city of Philly demands that you call it a cheesesteak doesn't change the fact that there are half a dozen places in my Massachusetts town where you could find a better steak and cheese for a couple bucks less. ˜ I'm glad I got to be a tourist and had fun trying a Philly institution, but it's not something I'd ever go out of my way for again."
7246,9,2,1,10/1/2012,We went because it was a must in the cheesesteak war. But I am glad we also had a Pat's sandwich which I liked more. Geno's was just OK.
7247,9,4,1,10/1/2012,"Holy crap! ˜Over 1,000 reviews, and the composite Yelp grade is 2.5 stars? ˜That's just plain, ol' sad. I must have gone on a really good day. ˜We didn't have any lines whatsoever, the folks there were pretty friendly, and most importantly, the cheesesteak was tasty. As mentioned in my review for Pat's, I went to four cheesesteak places during my short stay in Philly over a long weekend, and had a control sandwhich, a cheesesteak with whiz and onions at each and every place so that I'd be able to fairly judge the four-way competition (Pat's, Geno's, Jim's Steaks, and Ishkabibble's). For me, Geno's came out on top. ˜For starters, Geno's is a much more welcoming establishment than Pat's. ˜They actually appear to marginally care. ˜The decor is much brighter, and there's more of an energetic vibe to this place. ˜It also seems much cleaner, and all the photos of Geno's plastered everywhere, including the beverage cups, is an actually amusing marketing scheme. ˜I get it, he's a legend around here (at least for tourists?). But when it came to my cheesesteak, the steak was thinly sliced and easy to chew, it was tender, and the balance of whiz and onions was on point. ˜It was a juicy, tasty morsel of sandwich and I definitely liked it more than the competition across the street. ˜We also had cheese fries because being in the ""Fat Zone"" in Philly, we were ALL about the cheese whiz. ˜ They definitely take top honors from me."
7248,9,1,1,9/30/2012,"really pathetic cheesesteak. my brother in law actually meant to go into pat's but somehow went in and bought the wrong thing. Not sure how that happens, but that was his story. Cold and flavorless. I live in NY, and surprisingly I have yet to eat a cheesesteak better than Back East Cheesesteaks in Murray, Utah. Laugh all you want, but if you ever get a chance, your mind will be blown!"
7249,9,1,1,9/30/2012,Owner is a douche and pats is better.
7250,9,3,1,9/28/2012,"i was actually suprised by how good the cheesesteak was here the last time i went. ˜i've been a couple times and was never a fan, but this last time i must say, it was much better. ˜Now it's no jim's or tony luke's, but it wasn't bad. ˜They don't cook up the meat fresh so your sandwich comes out quick. ˜When it comes down to it this, as well as pat's, isn't worth going out of your way for."
7251,9,3,1,9/28/2012,"I'm from NY. Was already in PA, so decided to try this place that I've seen a lot of my friends have tried and posted pictures. You wait on a really long line, but it moves really quick. You order and then find a table with seats or stand and at on the high tables. I got my sandwich in less than 1 minute. So it's fast food quick. I had the ""Wiz With"". This means philly cheese steak sandwich with cheese wiz & onions. The onions were to my liking. The cheese and sandwich was very oily and wet. My sandwich was falling apart and the wrapper was ripping. Overall I thought it was okay. And my friends raved so much about it that I expected so much more. And plus, PA is the motherland of the philly cheese steak. I wanted to give 2 stars, but my fiance ate 2 himself and loved it. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars. Next time I want to try the other famous place right across the street from Geno's. It's called Pats"
7252,9,5,1,9/25/2012,"Yummmm Geno's! I'm surprised at all the negative reviews on here. I knew there would be some, but there at a lot!! This is one of the more touristy places to get a cheesesteak, but I am a local and this is still my favorite place to get a cheesesteak in Philadelphia. Yes, parking can be bad, yes you have to know how to order, yes there are rude signs, but most of the time my reviews are heavily based on food/taste/quality. I always get ""wiz with"" ...cheese is cheese wiz and with sauteed onions. The cheesesteaks are made very quickly, with lots of meat and lots of cheese on a huge roll. I always feel very happy when eating this huge cheesesteak. Be prepared for a food coma afterwards. I also find the Geno's experience to be very fun. When I go, I'm usually in a car cram-packed with 20-something kids craving greasy, filling food. I am usually not the one driving, so I find it fun on the adventure of finding parking. I also have my boyfriend order for me so it's done properly :). So, I guess you have to try for yourself and see if you like it. It's an experience I would say, also fun to compare the rivals Pat's and Geno's (I do prefer Geno's). And delicious, delicious cheesesteaks."
7253,9,1,1,9/24/2012,"Wish I could give it 0 stars. Visiting Philadelphia and Geno's/ Pat's was mentioned to me by several friends who were vaguely familiar with the area. Let me say this: SUBPAR. I could get better cheesesteaks in California. Geno's clearly uses their reputation to get away with using only cheap/ low quality ingredients. It was not made fresh and was ready and wrapped in less than 3 minutes- essentially cold. If it didn't have the name/history this would place would no longer be in business as far as I'm concerned. If you want a good cheesesteak: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. For Philadelphia's own sake, they better have some better cheesesteak joints."
7254,9,3,1,9/24/2012,"3 stars. Order a Cheesesteak with whiz and onions. The bread was fresh, warm and soft. Could be the best bread I have ever had on a cheesesteak. The Whiz was so hot it was almost watery which to my surprise actually made the sandwich better. The meat though did not have much flavor and was overcooked which was disappointing. This is definitely a tourist hot spot but still worth a try."
7255,9,2,1,9/20/2012,"There are 2 place in Philly to claim the best cheesesteaks and this is one of them (and directly across the street from the other one). The service is insane and there seating is limited. I found their cheesesteaks to be a bit grizzly and the cheese sauce was a bit fake. Don't go on the weekends (especially during the summer months) as that is when all the tourist create total chaos there. Go, if you just want to say you have been there, otherwise go elsewhere for a much better cheesesteak. Warning, have your order ready when you arrive at the window or they will send you on your way."
7256,9,3,1,9/20/2012,"Fun touristy spot, but I think Jim's on south street is better."
7257,9,5,1,9/20/2012,"What more can you say than hasn't been said. Everyone has their own opinion as far as who has the best steaks. If for some reason you think Pat's is better (they aren't), grab a friend and both of you go down there and each half from each, you will see and taste the difference. If you like Wit or Witout or Steve's Prince of Steaks, it seems like you're in the Geno's camp too; it might be that whole chopped steak vs. whole pieces of meat argument. They keep the line moving and surprisingly parking isn't too bad if you go not during prime time hours (before or after games, etc.). One of those places you have to go at least once so that when you're inevitably asked by someone from out of town, ""Where should I go for a good cheesesteak"" you can tell them."
7258,9,5,1,9/19/2012,"Disclaimer: We are mostly vegetarians. So we decided to eat some meat while in Philly. You can't go to Philly and not have a cheesesteak at one of the famous local joints can you? We checked out both Geno's and Pat's to compare :) We got a cheesesteak with onions and wiz and fries from both places. Geno was the winner! It was close though. The whole package was presented better in the end. The wiz on the bottom, the thinner slice of the meat. The assembly line ordering is impressive. Very little seating!"
7259,9,1,1,9/18/2012,"0 stars Not a fan of Genos. Steak was unseasoned, not chopped, dry and tasteless. It was like eatting a stale, old and unseasoned steak sandwhich. Would not go back and will probably warn many friends to avoid this place like the plague. For $10 I could get a better sandwich at a 7-11. ˜ /barf"
7260,9,2,1,9/16/2012,"For the fun and touristy thing to do, husband and I (dragged my parents as well) tried both Geno's and Pat's. ˜We all prefer Pat's philly cheesesteak more. ˜Sorry. The sandwich was kind of bland and the bread was tough. ˜Overall, just didn't even come close to expectation. ˜Given two stars because the 'rivalry' between the two places and how they are pretty much just across from each other, make it easy to try both places in one shot."
7261,9,5,1,9/15/2012,"Fantastic Cheesesteaks! ˜I like Pat's a little better, but this is very close. ˜When I'm here I always get both at the same time. ˜A lot of people are turned off by the attitudes or the political statements here, but I just focused on the food and it's amazing. ˜For out of towners like me, try it with the cheese wiz. ˜Sounds disgusting, but these people know what they're doing. ˜The tastes blend together perfectly!"
7262,9,4,1,9/12/2012,"A Philly Institution! Any place that puts a sign in the window that says ""This is America, speak English!"", is OK in my book. ˜If that offends you, too bad!!!! ˜That's what makes America great. ˜FREEDOM. ˜Thank a vet for that right by the way and rest in peace Joey Vento! OK, so now that the terrorists and europeans are all offended, lets get on to the purpose of this review, the cheese steak. As many of you know, Geno's and Pats have been bashing each others brains in on 9th and Wharton for many years. ˜Both have claims to fame. ˜So it comes down to the whole Ford Vs. Chevy debate...........which do you prefer?? ˜The only way to figure it out is to have one from each joint. As a famous Bose commercial once stated....we don't make the music, we just make it sound better. ˜Well, Pat may have invented the cheese steak but Genos makes it better! Here's why i like Genos better. ˜First, the Amoroso roll. ˜Slightly crunchy. Second, the steak. ˜Not chopped in a million pieces. ˜Real thin slices. ˜Better flavor content and fat distribution in the steak. ˜When you chop it up like Pats you can get a whole mouthful of fat chunks. ˜No thanks. ˜By the way, when you eat a steak at home, do you slice it or grind it up like coffee grounds?? ˜Exactly. Now that's the base of the sandwich. ˜This is where there are 8 million different variations. ˜If you want a true Philly steak, order it ""wit"" onions and whiz. ˜That's right. ˜Cheese whiz. ˜I myself was an onions and provolone guy for years until I met Joey. ˜He asked me if i ever had it with whiz. ˜Guess what? ˜I will never have it with anything else since Ive had whiz! I wont rate Pat's because its not bad. ˜Genos is just way better. ˜Plus its in a way better neighborhood than Pats! ˜LOL!!! (they are across the street from each other)"
7263,9,2,1,9/10/2012,"So I always see Pat's and Geno's on TV so I really wanted to eat here. ˜I brought a Philly cheesesteak from Pat's and my husband got his from Geno's so that we could compare. ˜ Both are far from the tourist scene (ie the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall) so it is a journey to get to either one. ˜ Philadelphia is apparently known for being rude (so our tour guide mentioned) and Pat's and Geno's live up to the reputation. ˜The woman at Pat's gave one guy a hard time because he didn't ask for a bag when he ordered. ˜When I tried to order soda, I was quickly rejected and told I had to go to the next window (sandwiches at one window, soda and fries at another). Geno's had a line and they have little patience if you don't know how to give your order right. In to the food... we preferred Pat's more than Geno's. ˜In fact I had to give my husband my Pat's cheesesteak and got stuck with the Geno's one. ˜ Pat's bread is softer, while Geno's was tougher kind of like old french bread. ˜The meat at Pat's was a little jucier but more fatty. ˜Neither had a real good steak taste though. ˜I got whiz on the Pat's sandwich which gave it a creamy texture, although they were pretty skimpy with it so there wasn't nearly enough whiz. My husband got provolone on the Geno's sandwich and it wasn't even melted. All in all, I wouldn't go to either place again. ˜Our tour guide pointed us towards Sonny's which is on Market street (3-4 blocks from the Liberty Bell so wat more convenient). It was also cheaper and way tastier. But if you are like me and have to go just to go, I recommend Pat's over Geno's."
7264,9,2,1,9/10/2012,"WELCOME TO VEGAS?? Well not quite but you know what I mean. Bright lights, shining neon signs, pictures of ""famous"" people all over.....yeah that's Geno's. Not gonna lie, cheesesteaks are kinda expensive!! Coming from a land of $1, $2 tacos, a $10 cheesesteak is pricey. I've been here once before but came with Jay C. to do the official test. I guess it's not fair that we tried Pat's first, but the main difference between the two for me was the bread. The bread at Geno's felt stale and did not hold up very well. The meat also was OK, but Pat's was much juicier. Plenty of seats and extra bright lights, almost uncomfortably bright at night. All in all I would take Pat's over Geno's. ˜I've made my decision... what's yours? -- Parking: Nonexistent. Streets are packed with cars and did not see a single open space. Suggest cabbing it here if you are a tourist."
7265,9,2,1,9/9/2012,"So I was pumped to go here after seeing this on the Food Network. The most impressive thing about this place is the hype. The sub was ok but it was pricey and small. The building was as impressive as the hype. It towers over Pat's Steaks which is why I went to Geno's on this trip. Next time I'll check out Pat's. 1 sub ""wit"" provolone was $8. Include 2 medium soda's and a fry and for a total of $16. Captain Harvey's here in Baltimore is WAAAAYYYYYYY better. Just saying!"
7266,9,1,1,9/8/2012,"Likes: I honestly can't think of any Dislikes: -The sign near the register. Honestly, why does Geno's think it's okay to offend any of their potential customers? By the way, the US doesn't have an official language. -dry meat GO TO PAT'S INSTEAD!!!!! The food is slightly cheaper at Pat's too :)"
7267,9,3,1,9/7/2012,"I did what everybody does. Cheese steak off... As soon as I got into Philly, my first meal had to be a cheese steak. I think I have to say both places are tied. My pluses of Geno's: -Tender steak and really juicy -Spicy condiment accessible: vinegar/chili's Negs: -Thin amount of meat. Get more from Pat's -Bread isn't toasted -I might be a minority on this, but I ain't feelin' the wiz and onions. Just too overwhelming and plastic tasting. I prefer provolone!"
7268,9,3,1,9/5/2012,"The showier twin of the Geno's and Pat's duo... it narrowly beats out its cross-street brother, but perhaps more on ambience than anything food-wise. Admittedly I prefer my meat more chopped, and they like long strips. All in all, not bad, but seriously overhyped."
7269,9,4,1,9/4/2012,Yummy and customer service is much better then Pat's. I found their cheese steak flavorful and after tasting this location and Pat's my group of friends also agreed this was the better of the two locations.
7270,9,1,1,9/4/2012,"NO WAY! for the price of this cheese steak, i could walk an extra five minutes to Georges on 9th and CHristian, pay HALF the price and actually have a sandwhich that tastes delicious. Every few months i go here because its the only place open at 3 am, and every few months at 3:30 am i find myself $10 poorer, and unsatisfied"
7271,9,2,1,9/3/2012,"This was the second place my boyfriend and I stopped at this weekend while in Philadelphia. Ok, we were across the street at Pat's and had to stop here to compare. Service at both places isn't great, I can tell you that, but they are pretty quick. I found Geno's to be slower, but less expensive. Our cheesesteak sandwich was $9.00 vs $9.50 at Pat's, but the bread wasn't toasted, and I think it would have been better if it was. Geno's also appeared to offer less meat, but Pat's cheesesteak wasn't toppling over with meat either. Like Pat's, Geno's offers free ketchup, mustard, relish, and hot peppers. There doesn't seem to be as much seating though, but my bf and I were lucky at both and were able to sit undisturbed. Both are super touristy and overpriced. I would suggest trying other cheesesteak places in Philadelphia, but unfortunately, I didn't have the time to do so and make recommendations."
7272,9,2,1,9/2/2012,"meh.. skip - With endless options for cheesesteaks in philly, this one is not worth the trip. the bread was not particularly great and the meat was very fatty. rude/apathetic service, soggy sandwich, and overall underwhelming. Of the two pat's is definitely better."
7273,9,2,1,9/1/2012,Booooooooo! Pat's is better.
7274,9,3,1,8/30/2012,"Read my review of Pat's. ˜Ditto! ˜Good, but not good enough for a return from me."
7275,9,2,1,8/30/2012,"Geno's is more of an ""experience"" place than ""Good cheesesteak place"" nowadays. With SO many places around Philadelphia offering delicious cheesesteak sandwiches, with their own twists, it's too hard to pick the ""BEST"" cheesesteak in Philly--people have different tastes. The only things I like most about Geno's is: the location filled with tourists and the outdoor seating. One thing remains the same: you HAVE to go to Geno's at least once in your life. Glad I took it off my bucket list sooner rather than later."
7276,9,2,1,8/29/2012,"I really didn't think this place kicked butt in the cheesesteak category. ˜The meat was sliced, not chopped with little to no flavor and the bread was chewy. I would say go accross the street to Pats..there you will find a much beefier sandwich that is traditionally chopped with cheese."
7277,9,2,1,8/29/2012,"DON'T DRINK THE KOOL-AID! As many yelps have already reiterated, the rankings of pats / genos as the best place for philly cheese stakes is nothing short of a long standing marketing hoax. Save your money and go to JIMs on south street for a decent steak."
7278,9,3,1,8/28/2012,"Don't leave Philly without having Thee Steak Sandwich ""wit wiz"". What does that mean? ...Cheese & grilled onions added. its a must do. don't be boring. add it. My co-worker and I ordered one from Geno's & one from Pats. Apparently they are always fighting to beat each other out. Service is quick & it will run you about $9 bucks. not too bad for the famous foot-long-errr. One word: Delicious. Don't freak about breaking that diet, try it and enjoy each bite. Place is open 24 hrs, I've been told its the must have drunk food in the city. but expect a line around the corner if you come around 2am. yumm!"
7279,9,2,1,8/27/2012,"Came here on a Thursday night with my brother, he was visiting me from out of town. He wanted to see what was the hype about Philly cheesesteaks, and as seen on TV Geno was on Food Network somewhere in the past. He was disappointed and so was I. Geno is extremely flashy with their neon lighted-up sign! It is definitely is a visual attraction, and that's all there is to Geno. The cheesesteak is mainly composed of bread, with a few slices of steak and a small amount of cheese. It was by far the most disappointing cheesesteaks I have had in Philly. To top it off, service was horrible. I assumed it's the fact that they get all the businesses from advertisement, so that they developed the attitude of ""I can care less"". It is literally across from Pat's, so Take all the photos you want with Geno, but go try Pat's instead. I recommend coming here to see all the lights, it does give you some sort of excitement, but I would go across the street to get Pat's instead."
7280,9,1,1,8/27/2012,"Very disappointed with Geno's. ˜The cheesesteak was not seasoned, the onions were raw and we asked for provolone and there was a small amount of cheese."
7281,9,1,1,8/26/2012,Was not impressed when I tried Geno's. The meat was dry and the service wasn't that great. I wish my first philly cheesesteak experience was better but I was disappointed.
7282,9,1,1,8/26/2012,"I have been canvassing for President Obama's re-election campaign on Saturdays, in the ""City of Brotherly Love"" . Who can go to Philly and NOT eat at Geno's ??? Right ?? So, after a long afternoon and some time to spare my friends and I decide to go and have cheese steaks . Mind you , we are fresh from canvassing , tired , hot and hungry (and wearing out Obama gear) Welp, apparently the lovely folks at Genos' don't support our president. The stares from the employees and the not so nice lady at the register, made it clear that we were not wanted there. How rude is it to ask for people to speak english on their line , only for them to speak in Italian about us ??? I know what they said about us , but I will refrain from posting it here , as this is not that kind of forum. Cheese streaks ˜in tow, we sit at the very dirty tables and inhale these cheese steaks within seconds .... only due to hunger (extreme hunger) did we even bother to stay here ... Assessment of the cheese steaks .... DRY ! Not even worth the 9 bucks spent on them . Next time I am in Philly , I will be taking my business to Pat's . Overall , the most uncomfortable dining experience I have ever had !! ˜Political views should not chase your customers away .. and to result in calling them names in another language , when you ask that ˜ppl only speak english on your line ??? Really Geno's ?????? ˜NEVER EATING HERE AGAIN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
7283,9,1,1,8/25/2012,"My experience was so disappointing that I wont even bother going into detail. Came down to philly to help GF's sister move into her new place and we all decided to see what this philly cheese steak battle thing was all about. There was a line to order, didn't take long as it moved relatively fast. The phily with wiz was $9.00 and it was done and ready in under a minute. For those that want to or are highly anticipating trying out philly cheese steaks here, be forewarned; They are a massive let down. There's no words to express how disappointing it is - The meat is bland and flavorless, the onions are a bit luke warm from the quick saute, plus they're oily, and the bread is nothing special. I can honestly say I have had better philly cheese steak served to me at the college dining hall and at a cheaper price I might add. Absolutely the first and last time I would ever fall for the hype."
7284,9,2,1,8/25/2012,"bread was hard and seemed either stale or not fresh, they didn't have green peppers, the meat was dry. I threw half of it away. this place was really disappointing."
7285,9,3,1,8/25/2012,"It's a good cheesesteak, but not be the overloaded greasy goodness that you came to Philly looking for... Little light on the steak and cheese and heavy on the price. They do have quicker service than any fast food place. American Wit Out"
7286,9,2,1,8/24/2012,"Philadelphia is synonymous with cheesteaks so of course you need to try one when you make your way out there. ˜Some say don't walk to Geno's and take a cab. ˜It was late at night and was a long distance from my hotel so that's what a co-worker and I did. ˜A drive to Geno's made me understand why. ˜It's a bit sketchy especially at night. ˜ Not knowing anything about Geno's and Pat's made it pretty much a coin flip when choosing which one to go to. ˜At the last minute we went to Geno's. ˜The bright neon lights at night made it look like a casino and attracted you like a moth to a bright light. ˜I ended up ordering the Wiz cheesesteak sandwich since I saw a local ahead of me order one. ˜I was expecting for a bit of a wait since I was thinking that they still had to cook the meat but after a minute it was ready which was way faster than I expected. ˜As I started to eat it, I found that there was nothing special about it. ˜The bread was okay, the meat was good but not great, and the fries were a bit stale. ˜I totally expected a lot more especially from a famous cheesesteak place! ˜ So what did I learn? ˜Geno's is all hype. ˜I've had better cheesesteaks like Phat Philly right here in SF. ˜But hey, at least I was able to eat at an iconic food place so that's cool."
7287,9,2,1,8/22/2012,"Sorry Geno's...but Pat's has a better cheesesteak! I did add hotsauce to to the cheesesteak & thought I was going to die, so that may have distracted me from the actual cheesesteak itself! I can say....Geno's fries are better than Pat's."
7288,9,3,1,8/22/2012,"Not as fresh as pat's, crappier bread, tastes saltier and not as fresh as other Philly steaks (pat's)"
7289,9,3,1,8/22/2012,"For sure flashier and just as full both times I was here. Genos is slightly cheaper, and we had to partake in the ultimate taste test and get one at Genos and one at Pats. I made the mistake and got it with provolone, coming back to my husband he said I should have gotten wiz cuz thats how its done so we got wiz at Pats. I am sure that even getting wiz at Genos Pats would have still won by a ton. Genos had nicer sliced meat, though flavorless and the thin provolone and nothing else did nothing for the sandwich. The second time around we went straight to Pats and stocked up. If you like me are afraid of cheese wiz scarred by the crap out of the can get over it and get the wiz, thats where its at!"
7290,9,2,1,8/22/2012,"So, I heard about this rivalry between Geno's Steaks and Pats which are located across from each other. I decided to try both to determine for myself which is better. Let's get one thing straight... In order for a rivalry to exist your sandwiches must be somewhat good. While on the quest to find the best cheese steak I found the two worst. At Genos, The bread was hard and meat was bland. The atmosphere was not very inviting either. I didn't expect to see signs stating ""I want my country back"" (not sure who took it from him) and ""press 1 for English 2 for Deportation"". After seing these signs and being of Mexican decent, I wouldnt doubt if someone spit in my sandwich. The staff didn't seem friendly at all. Geno's seems more like a tourist attraction than anything. If you still have an itch to try them just to check for yourself, I recommend splitting a sandwich with someone and then head to Tony Lukes."
7291,9,1,1,8/20/2012,"As a Philadelphia native the only acceptable excuse to go to this ""establishment"" is if it's 2am and your drunk and you're taken there by friends without direct knowledge of where you're going, just constant reassurances that you're being taken somewhere with food. This is how I came upon this place both times. And both times I (even in my drunk stupor)was irritated that for almost 12 dollars ˜all I got was half of a mediocre cheese steak (because really thats about the size of it) and treated badly. And honestly I find it embarrassing that this place is so heavily correlated with Philadelphia. For the tourists; 1. I implore you to visit Tony Luke's or Steve's if you're looking for a real cheese steak. I can't really speak on Pat's because I haven't been but from the reviews I've read it's probably only a small step up from this place. 2. We're not all a$$holes guys, we're really not. Nor do all of us speak with an obnoxiously heavy/ incomprehensible accent. Not to sound like a trader to my city but I feel like its overkill at this place. Actually I feel like everything's overkill at this place. Between the prices and the rude attitudes I'm not sure if they think they're giving their customers a one of a kind ""Philly charm"" or if they're really that socially retarded. Either way all they're giving is a poor name to this city. If I want attitude I can get it or free Mon-Fri, all I have to do is show up for work. Oh and in case it was lost on anyone from the 500 other reviews that mentioned it they're also xenophobic/racist...which they have no problem advertising with all their adorable Archie Bunker-esq signs. Yeah, real classy place."
7292,9,2,1,8/19/2012,Cheesesteak just okay but cheese fries was hella good!
7293,9,1,1,8/19/2012,"It was the Philadelphia battle of the cheesesteak that our friends from out of town were seeking - how did Pat's and Geno's muster up toeach other? ˜What better way to find out then to compare them side by side? ˜ We split up - two of us bought two steaks from Pat's, the other two of us brought two steaks from Geno's. ˜My friend and I, both of us Philadelphians, picked up the Pat's steaks and went over to Geno's to locate our visiting friends. ˜I had a fleeting thought about suggesting we eat on neutral territory, somewhere in between the two establishments, but our friends had ordered two Geno's cheesesteaks as well as cheese fries to add to our artery-clogging smorgasborg. ˜I shrugged the thought it away - we had more Geno's food than Pat's, it was a slow night, there were many, many outside tables available, and I figured we would eat somewhere discretely. ˜Apparently, I'll whole-heartedly admit, despite being in Philadelphia for many years now, I may have underestimated the animosity of the rivalry. ˜But, for the record (this proves vital later... apparently...) Pat's condiments went on Pat's steaks, Geno's condiments went on Geno's steaks. Scout's honor. We sat down to eat and we hadn't been eating for more than five minutes before a voice called out, ""Hey... did you just put our cheesesteak in a Pat's wrapper?!?? ˜Let me see that steak!!!!"" We looked at each other, shrugged, but after a repeated demand, our friend obligingly went over the window with his Geno's steak in it's Geno's wrapper and showed it to him. ˜That seemed to satisfy them, and they quieted down for a little while. And then... well, historians debate whether either the battle of Vicksburg or Gettysburg was the turning point of the Civil War. ˜For this Cheesesteak War, the deciding moment hinged upon one highly processed, salty-but-sweet, tomato-based product. ˜Our visitors had left the ketchup off the Geno's steaks, leaving it up to us if we wanted it or not. ˜So, one of us went up to the condiment stand to get ketchup. ˜We then heard, ""That is messsssssssssed up!! You're stealing our ketchup and putting it on Pat's steaks! ˜That is messed UP, man! Hey, look, man, they're getting our ketchup to put on Pat's steaks."" We thought they were annoyed and ribbing on us a little bit, but nobody sounded or appeared extremely angry or upset. ˜""We're not,"" we tried to clarify. ˜""It's your ketchup going on your cheesesteak."" ˜I thought to myself, ""Even so, they can't really be serious about this paltry amount (maximum two tablespoons full) of ketchup."" ˜Our comment initially didn't seem to make an impact, but after a few minutes there was a lull in the commentary. ˜I figured that was the end of that. And then someone said, ""I can't believe it... The cops are here."" ""What?? No way... there's no way they called the cops on us!!!"" I turned my head, and, lo and behold, there, in full Philadelphia police regalia, hands on his belt loops, is a policeman moseying up to our table. ˜At first he talks facing away from us, and for the first ˜few seconds I can't process what he's saying and if he's directing it to us or to the people behind us. ˜I just couldn't quite wrap my head around the fact that they CALLED THE POLICE over this. ˜ ""We got a complaint that you guys are causing trouble here. ˜They are saying that you're stealing from them, that you're being difficult, that you're causing a scene. ˜This is private property and they want you to leave the premises."" ˜The list of accusations continued without interruption, without a pause for a response or a defense from us; our friend kept trying to get in a word in edgewise to give our account of the situation and to at least counter the accusation that we were ""stealing their ketchup,"" but the cop continued to talk loudly over him for the next few minutes. Eventually, my other friend stood up and said, ""Come on. ˜Let's just go. ˜Let's just go,"" in an attempt to diffuse the situation. ˜I stood up, and we started walking away, with my other friend still persistently, but not belligerently, attempting to explain our side to the police officer. As we were walking away, I was overwhelmed with a wave of anger. ˜From a logical, legal perspective, these horrid people were in the right - we were on their property, and they could kick us off if they wished. But to go to such levels to call the police?? ˜To treat us paying customers so rudely when our biggest sin was to engage in the classic Philadelphia cheesesteak battle?? ˜What a horrible business model, turning away paying customers who will now harbor a sense of ill-will towards Geno's. We weren't being belligerent customers; we were there sitting calmly and eating except when 1) we ordered 2) we were asked to show that we ordered Geno's steaks 3) we wanted ketchup. I've been a Philadelphian for seven and a half years now. ˜Many times, I've brought my visiting friends and tourists to Geno's. ˜I never will again."
7294,9,1,1,8/19/2012,"Visited geno today, what a WASTE'!!!!!!!! I ordered meat, provolone and mushrooms. The mushrooms were straight out of a can, terrible, they don't even grill them. Barely any provolone and the meat was fatty and tasteless. ˜The worst part was I asked for hot peppers, they are outside and guess what, they aren't even sliced for sandwich style. Never again."
7295,9,4,1,8/16/2012,This is a really good sandwich. ˜You can't go wrong here. ˜In my humble opinion I would still choose the other guys across the street (Pats) but this is still a great sandwich nonetheless.
7296,9,3,1,8/16/2012,"We headed across the street to Geno's to split a cheesesteak post-Pat's. ˜And, at that point, I figured anything had to be better. I didn't enjoy the flashy decor while standing in line.. I appreciated Pat's much more low-key, retro look instead. ˜Geno's looks much like the auto body place by the same name across the street, plus a lot of police-gear. ˜I Googled Joey Vento, the owner of Geno's, while standing in line and then find out he was a racist Tea Partyer. ˜Great! ˜But I was already in line and hankering for a REAL cheesesteak after the mess Pat's threw at me. I watched the cooks throwing thin slices of steak onto the grill (you can actually see through the clean window here). ˜They were just barely a smidge nicer than Pat's here. ˜I thought it was a pay-at-one-window-pick-up-food-at-next type deal.. apparently not, because as I took my change and hurried to the next window (because everyone is hustling you to hurry the f up), I heard some guy at the first window yelling ""She made awwwf wit-out her SAMMICH!"" ˜LOL! This had me chuckling all day. ˜I made off without my sammich! I love to pay for $10 sandwiches and then just make a run for it as a prank! I tried to ignore what I knew about Geno's right-wing proprietor (RIP) as I bit into the delectable, cheesy goodness. ˜Now this was the kind of cheesesteak I came to Philly for. ˜The bread was better, the steak was WAY better, and the Cheez Whiz... well, it was more plentiful. ˜:) ˜(Vento died of a heart attack, btw..) Now that I've gotten Geno's and Pat's out of the way, I can't wait to return to Philly for an even better cheesesteak..because I know they exist! (proof: I've actually been to Jim's before!)"
7297,9,4,1,8/15/2012,"Today a group of four tried 3 different well renown cheesesteak places; Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. Jim's was the best of the three that we tried. The cheesesteaks were larger and better than Pat's. Geno's and Pat's had outdoor seating. Geno's (2nd) had thicker slices and seem to marinate their meat. Jim's (1st) had a huge wait in the line but was way worth it. Great cheesesteaks."
7298,9,2,1,8/14/2012,"i could almost copy and paste my review for Pat's to this one. both were horrible, but Geno's not as much. the woman taking orders looked like a grumpy witch and i really don't understand the purpose of ordering fries from a different window. like the place across the street, these two joints are completely over hyped. save your money and time and go some where else. i wish i could suggest a place, but i yet to find a place in Philly that blew me away with a fantastic cheese steak."
7299,9,1,1,8/13/2012,"First, their cheesesteaks are tasteless. Pat's has more flavorful cheesesteaks. The establishment is overtly racist. There were multiple signs that discouraged non-English speakers from patronizing this place. There are two big signs about a police shooting between a police officer and a Muslim American, which was a very controversial case. This place does not know what an American is. It is embarassing that this place is representing Philadelphia. The food channel should have done a better job in their profiling of this establishment. Ask the many, many friendly locals for a better quality cheesesteak. Patriotism is not about hating others."
7300,9,4,1,8/13/2012,"Dear Cheesesteak Lovers: I won't say which $9 cheesesteak I liked better. Stop being a wuss, and reading endless reviews about whether Geno's or ""the other place"" is better. ˜Order one from each. ˜You know you want to. ˜Eat both cheesesteaks back-to-back, and decide for yourself. ˜MAN UP. Sincerely, K. W."
7301,9,2,1,8/13/2012,"On vacation in Philadelphia, this famous cheesesteak place was a must-visit for my wife and I. ˜Unfortunately, we were both very disappointed by both Pat's and Geno's. ˜ We ate at Pat's first, got one with provolone and one with ""whiz."" ˜Surprisingly, the whiz was actually better than provolone. ˜Overall, though, both sandwiches were completely mediocre. ˜The bread was unremarkable, the meat was tough and flavorless. ˜The fries were quite soggy. ˜I was very pumped for this, so the experience was a huge letdown. ˜ With lowered expectations, we next ventured to Geno's. ˜My wife and I opted to just split a sandwich with ""whiz."" ˜Geno's was slightly better, mostly due to somewhat more flavorful steak. ˜Otherwise, the experience was almost identical. ˜The steak is cut a bit thicker at Geno's, but the sandwich is similarly mediocre. ˜ Sad fact: I have had better Philly Cheesesteaks at Texadelphia in Texas. ˜Also, Silver Dinner in Maryland has better cheesesteaks. ˜ Side note: ˜While at Geno's, they were filming an interview with a guy who was presumably the owner/manager. ˜My wife and I were sitting behind him, likely on camera. ˜I literally laughed as the interviewer was asking, ""what's your secret to making the best cheesesteak blah blah blah."" ˜I was also prominently drinking a soda from a Pat's cup. ˜Oops! ˜I'm a jerk."
7302,9,3,1,8/12/2012,"I did not try Pat's, we opted for Geno's. ˜It was good, not bad at all but nothing blew me away. ˜I had Cheese-steak with Onions and Provolone and my wife had the same but with cheese whiz. ˜Both were good, I think the whiz was better. ˜Still similar steak-ums as a kid, but not exactly the same. ˜I prefer Jim's Steak because the toppings were better."
7303,9,2,1,8/12/2012,"This place sucks straight up. I'm not that hard to please but this food was booty. Fries were kinda nasty and had a real frozen, non authentic taste to them; I threw them away half way through. The cheesesteak was bland, needed way more seasoning, needed more ingredients (only came with steak, cheese, and onions). Waited in like for like 20 minutes for some bull. I cannot even believe how overhyped this place is. Do people actually return?!?!?! I might be too hard on this legendary establishment, but it was just bad. Pat's takes the cake for sure. And what's with the sign at the counter stating press 1 for ˜English or press 2 for deportation? And the other sign saying order in english...Is this really just overlooked? I don't even know why I give 2 stars...for not making me throw up I suppose. I will never be back!!!!!!!"
7304,9,2,1,8/9/2012,"OK, Lets get real. I don't get it. The attitude sucks here. The spoiled kid who I presume is the owners son is a jerk. How about saying thanks to someone. Customers are dropping some heavy cash after waiting in line forever and you don't have the decency to greet them or say thank you? That is BS! It's not like there is a shortage of cheesesteaks joints in Philly and the burbs. I am not going back due to the bad attitude of these pompous jerks."
7305,9,5,1,8/8/2012,"We came, we saw, we had cheesesteaks from both Geno's and Pat's. Geno's is the young upstart (1966) right across from the original, Pat's King of Steaks (1930). It's appropriately the brighter and more offensively colored of the two, the younger brother if you will. At Geno's we added grilled onions but of course stayed with the cheese wiz. While Pat's steak had more of a chopped texture, Geno's was sliced into thin rounds, which were perhaps higher quality or at least more distinguishable, but drier. Fortunately, this was offset by the cheese wiz, which was applied more generously and seemed to be of a thicker consistency, maybe even approaching Velveeta. This same cheese came on our 'freedom' fries, and here it was a little thick for my taste. The sandwich itself is worth the lore. Be ready to order, and be ready to sit or, more likely, stand under their outdoor awning, because that's all there is. Also, it's cash only."
7306,9,3,1,8/6/2012,"DAMN YOU GENO!!! Your steaks are friggin AMAZING! ALMOST amazing enough to ignore the tons of racist signs telling me I better speak English or don't bother standing in line (which I do, but if I spoke any other language it shouldn't matter)... How is someone NOT from this country gonna tell OTHERS how to behave when they come here? Ironically, the people that work behind the counter don't speak English (rather, some sort of half-mouthed blabber)... Kinda sound like a patient of a severe stroke... and some lady who can't HEAR English...Evidently, you must YELL everything to her. Social skills are lacking at this establishment to say the least.. Funny, he says Marines fought for the right to speak English... I beg to differ buddy. I fought so you can speak whatever you want! OK..enough of the rant.... The racist signs and the long lines, retarded staff isn't enough to stop me from driving 2 Hours just to get a few of these tasty treats... But it IS enough to keep me from rating higher than a 3!"
7307,9,3,1,8/6/2012,"Geno, not bad at all. ˜ But you came in second to the fella across the street. ˜:) Try a lil salt & peper on 'em. ˜ Sumpin."
7308,9,4,1,8/6/2012,"On my first trip to Philly, i had to stop by and check out both places for their cheesesteaks. ˜So of course i went to both here and Pat's and got a few of each to compare. ˜I will say right off the bat that this was my favorite of the two. The big signs and lights are fancy and fun, but did not care. ˜It was busy, but not too bad and you dont have to wait long at all. ˜ I went with the classic with onions and whiz. ˜I will say that the bread is not as soft as pat's and they use a bit more cheese that i need. ˜But the steak was super juicy and full of flavor. ˜The onions are nice and big here so you get that flavor (that was lacking at Pat's). So mostly what i liked the most is that Geno's had more flavor over Pat's to me. ˜But almost too damn close to call it. ˜Do what i did, and get one from each."
7309,9,3,1,8/4/2012,"I wouldn't go so far as to give this place less than 3 stars. ˜I visited this place on the same exact day that I visited Pat's last Spring. ˜Geno's steaks are great in the sense that they slice their beef vice chops them -- this method brings out the meat flavor better IMHO. ˜I ordered a steak whiz wit, and it was delicious. ˜If they had offered peppers and mushrooms, I would have chosen this place over Pat's. ˜1 star off for the multiple signs -- it's just boisterous and obnoxious. ˜Spend less money on electricity and more on offering sandwich toppings. ˜I would still recommend this tourist hot-spot for comparison with their neighborhood rival Pat's."
7310,9,4,1,7/30/2012,"On the website I was not too impressed with Geno's however in terms of marketing I thought they did a much better job at making the store attractive with bright orange color and decorated with patches from polices from all over the country. Ordering was simpler with limited selections on the cheesesteak. ˜ I got the fact Geno loved the country and wanted people to order in English but the sticker on the ordering counter was just plain ignorant. As for the cheesesteak I thought they were more of a purist, did the better job with keeping the ingredients simple- clean slices of steak, use of real slices of cheese (example provolone or american) and onions. However you could still order that crazy cheesewhiz. The cheesesteak I ordered was on the bland side but I liked that I knew what I was eating. Likes: Nice lean slices of steak instead of bits and pieces and fatty Provolone Cheese Dislikes: Blander in taste Onions could be softer Bread Service was better Bright and cheerful place to eat They invested more in the store"
7311,9,3,1,7/29/2012,"I prefer Geno's over Pats though my favorite place to get my Philly Cheesesteaks while in philly is Sonnys over near the liberty bell/old town districts. Good density to the bread to soak up your greasy meat. Fresh, flavorful ribeye cuts of meat thinly sliced. A tasty cheesesteak and good thing to treat your hangover. Very satisfying. Parking in this area is always a bitch! Bring CASH"
7312,9,1,1,7/26/2012,"Xenophobes with mediocre cheesesteaks. I ate at Geno's one time and was less than impressed with my sandwich. Half way through I realized my companion was barely eating hers and asked why and she told me about some xenophobic signage I missed. When I went back to read it I regretted giving a racist establishment my money. Pat's across the street is a bit better. The bread is about the same level but the meat there is better. (Normally it's the bread that makes a great cheesesteak, but Genos' quality was impacted by the meat.) For a truly great steak, ditch the tourist traps and head down to Jim's on South Street."
7313,9,2,1,7/26/2012,Just visited Genos. I am from Chicago and figured I would see what the cheesesteak hype is about. Geno's I must say was not that good. there was 8 of us and ˜we all agree. thick cut and not that flavorful. I had to put hot sauce all over the thing to add flavor. Even chicago's most average Cheesesteak beats this one. I am so glad I tried Pats first. It is head and shoulders better in every way. Fail.
7314,9,5,1,7/25/2012,"I have to say that I do enjoy Geno's better than Pat's. Aside from the physical appearance of Geno's, their cheesesteak is really dam good. Different also, if I might add. No, the neon lights didn't attract me. No, this is not the first Philly cheesesteak I've had. Yes, I do think it's overpriced but look at all the other cheesesteak spots in Philly, ok then. The bread was cold but I can live with that. There were slices of steak piled on top of the cheese wiz which covered the bread. I loved how you can taste the pieces of steak and savor each mouthful. The best part is the juices that the slices of meat oozes out. With chopped steak, it's dry and all the juices of the meat have been beatened out whereas if you grill the slices, the juice still clings on. Which is why Geno's won me over."
7315,9,3,1,7/24/2012,"Let's be perfectly honest here - Pat's and Geno's are the same damn steak except on chops their meat and one loves neon. ˜Let's not split hairs. You come here for the touristic experience of ordering, because it's quick, and not for ˜a great gastronomic feast. ˜For that, it's good. ˜Great when drunk - otherwise settle down, it's a cheesesteak for goodness sake. Oh, and whiz wit all day."
7316,9,1,1,7/22/2012,"I can get a better cheese steak at some ghetto corner store. Overpriced, tasteless, and tough to chew. This place is just living off of the tourists who are not smart enough to realize they are paying for overpriced slop."
7317,9,2,1,7/22/2012,"The meat was a bit gummy and way too much fat on it. I liked Pat's better than this place. Go to Pat's instead. It's right across the street and if you're looking cute, the guys working there will let you know so!"
7318,9,1,1,7/21/2012,Epic fail! Half raw meat on stale bread. ˜Who comes back and eats this stuff? ˜Or is it just tourists who like neon lights? Go to Jim's on South Street or Chink's for a real cheesesteak.
7319,9,4,1,7/20/2012,"I have been eating Geno's since I was a kid, I have not tried other Philadelphia cheesesteak businesses. I love this place. The ordering process can be intimidating sometimes. I love wit Wiz but if I want to take it on the long trip home, I get the steak wit Provolone."
7320,9,3,1,7/19/2012,"I had never had a philly cheesesteak before Geno's so it was pretty good for my first one. Was a bit too oily/drippy but other than that the meat wasn't dry and the flavor alright. I've heard that there are better ones so until I have something to compare to, Geno's gets a 3 in my book."
7321,9,1,1,7/17/2012,"Meat = Thin, really small portion, no flavor Wiz = It was wet and runny?!?!?! It dripped all over the place. ˜ Onions = They were onions...what else can I say....they were diced and added onion flavor Bread = The one thing I did enjoy was the bread. It was fresh and soft. All and all a utter disappointment! (sidebar: when I tried to check in on Yelp it asked 'Did you mean Pat's"" ˜When I did check into Pat's it did not ask me if I meant Geno's....)"
7322,9,1,1,7/16/2012,"Terrible! ˜I lived in Norristown for years. ˜My mother lived in Philly for years. ˜I've eaten good Philly steak sandwiches made by small ""mom and pop"" delis. ˜ I came back to this part of the country in April of 2010. ˜Went to Genos for their famous steak sandwich. ˜I was appalled! The meat was gristly and the ""cheese"" is Cheez Whiz or something close. ˜It's ladled on. ˜I wish we had chosen Pat's instead of Geno's. ˜I don't know if Pat's is better, as we didn't eat there, but it couldn't possibly be worse. F.Y.I.: ˜There IS a line around Geno's but I cannot understand why unless it's because they are all new customers and have not eaten there before. Stay away! ˜We won't be back."
7323,9,4,1,7/16/2012,"Made the trip from CT primarily to taste the legends and make the comparison of the two proverbial giants of the Philly Cheesesteak scene, Geno's and Pat's. Did the classic 'Whiz Wit' at each and while neither was anything that absolutely blew me away in taste alone, I won't be driving past without stopping anytime soon. Nothing anyone else hasn't said or doesn't know, but busy, and 'heres-your-change-and-your-sandwich-see-ya' very quick service. No problem here as the food is the star. In the end, both worthy of the hype but no doubt there's still something better out there. No true discernable taste difference between the two, although the texture of the meat might make a difference to some if comparing the two. From the standalone perspective: great bread, meat good and tender but limited in taste, and Whiz is Whiz. ˜The combination works well and IMO that is why they're here. It'd be a regular stop if I lived anywhere close by."
7324,9,1,1,7/15/2012,"Came here on business and decided to try Geno's. ˜I'm sad to report that I left very unimpressed and disappointed! The meat had almost no flavor at all. The portions of meet and ""wiz"" (cheese wiz) weren't anything like I saw when I saw a show on cable about them vs. Pat's. I have to say that the cheese steak sandwiches back in CA at Jersey Mike's or Philly's Best blow away these in every way. It was a fun stop while here but I'm going to head over to Tony's tomorrow and see if they are much better like I've read all over online."
7325,9,5,1,7/15/2012,"A lot of the reviews are based on the fact that the reviewer doesn't like Geno's stance on Speak English. ˜ Well I ate here so my review is based on that. ˜It's gwady themed placed and the building is shaped like V. ˜All outdoor seating only and its open 24/7. ˜It's a stones throw from Pat's and I bet stones have been thrown. You order on the left side of the building and it's cash only...don't worry there's an ATM directly across from the right side of the building. ˜The first window is for cheese steak orders. ˜Plain, with provlone, whiz or American cheese. ˜You can get onions or not. ˜The second window is for soda, a full line of Pepsi and Coke products. ˜I think you also order your fries here. ˜ We went just after a Phillies game and it was packed. ˜The line to order was about 80+ but it moves fast. ˜Seating is limited but you can sit on the edge of the basketball court outside of the fenceline. I got the cheese steak with provlone and my boyfriend got it with whiz. ˜I got the provolone. Gee Zus, they were both great...but I liked the one with whiz better! ˜Worth the trip, long line and everything else."
7326,9,3,1,7/12/2012,"Among junk food: Compared to Pats: I like them better. Their steaks and cheese I enjoy more, and are in general more juicy. Their bread is alittle hard for me. Not the best cheese steak I've had."
7327,9,1,1,7/11/2012,"We live a few blocks away from Geno's and have been here a handful of times with our tourist family and friends. I feel like when you move to Philly from another state, you go through a cheesesteak progression: First, you go to Geno's due to hearing it has the most famous cheesesteak. You then hear Pat's is the better option. Next up is Jim's. Finally, you realize the true good cheesesteak of the ""majors"" is Tony Luke's. In any case, the point is that Geno's is at the bottom of that hierarchy. Maybe they used to be good, but now they just ride on tourist popularity. The meat is dry, there are very few toppings options, and you walk away every time feeling like you could probably get a better cheesesteak most anywhere else. Also factored into my impression of Geno's is their blatant xenophobia. It's not about foreigners in general (though I'm sure that's true too) as it is about the growing spanish-speaking population in our neighborhood. Seriously, you live in a city which is by nature multi-cultural. Get over it."
7328,9,1,1,7/11/2012,"this shit was horrible. bland, dry meat on some break. smh. they onl get business due to the history. smh and they charge too much! ANNDDD they are rude!"
7329,9,2,1,7/8/2012,"Genos or Pats? I have to say PATS. Why? Well the sandwich is not bad, but what really turned me off about this place is the blatantly bad attitude and poor taste of the owners to flaunt their political ideology on the exterior of the restaurant. The late owner Geno (R.I.P.) mixed politics with the cheesesteaks in this place, and made no bones about it; even on the website right now (2012), he is seen pointing to a sign that says, ""you're in America, order in ENGLISH!"" Now, seriously, how many foreigners came to this mans counter and started speaking their native tongue? Judging from the photos of every d-bag Fox news commenter (these people are NOT journalists, its op-ed right wing propaganda) along the outside walls, and STILL calls french fries ""freedom fries"" because the French government was smart enough not to buy the lies told by GW Bush and friends, and told us to WAIT instead of going to war; well this leaves a bad taste in my mouth that no pepsi will wash away. If you want to be a right wing zombie with no critical thought, then perhaps Geno's is the cheessteak for you, but for this compassionate, free thinking independent LIBERAL Italian and food fanatic, I will spend my money elsewhere."
7330,9,3,1,7/5/2012,"Hmm, I guess I just don't like regular cheesesteaks that much. If I could add things to the traditional cheesesteak, I guess it wouldn't be a cheesesteak anymore. Geno's is a bit different in that the steaks are thicker slices of meat that doesn't curl up (reminds me of slices of ribeye, but I don't think that's the quality you're getting). So go if you are interested, go down, try Pat's too, and have a good time."

7332,9,1,1,7/3/2012,"THIS PLACE SUCKS! ˜Looking at their current rating I can see I am not the only one with this sentiment. ˜Where to begin? ˜ The sandwich itself is disgusting. ˜These huge chunks of chewy sinuey beef?? are covered in radio active orange cheese wiz on a weak piece of what seems to be grocery store bread. ˜The sandwich looks like what you would throw up after a proper cheese steak from anywhere else. ˜Which also makes me question why anyone needs to go to Philly. ˜Try Carls Steaks in NYC and save a 2 hour drive. ˜If you live in Philly, make the best of what you got. The staff is either burnt out or seriously think too much of themselves. ˜Just because you have a glowing orange cheesesteak sign on your building and people come there for cheesesteak does not make it a registered UNESCO site. ˜Get off yourselves. ˜There is this crazy line system that they have in place and if you don't place the order right they whine and complain like they have something better to do. ˜The best story I have is that after buying $25 in cheesesteaks from Geno's I wanted to use their hot sauce (also horrible; just pure heat, no flavor) on my Pat's cheesesteak as well as the Geno's. ˜I would understand if I just didn't spend money there and did this but I just spent $25! ˜Some roid rage ape behind the counter started screaming at me to not do it or i have to leave. ˜Real great customer service, NOT.

7334,9,3,1,6/29/2012,"The battle rages on. ˜Geno's or Pat's. ˜Years ago when I was an airline employee I commuted between Minneapolis and Philadelphia every Friday night. ˜ Those were those days when airline employees traveled first class. ˜So I started asking my fellow passengers Geno's or Pat's. ˜ It was always fun as everyone had an opinion. ˜Once a fight almost broke out. First off Geno's was not on the scene until 1966. ˜Pat's was the first and was the one that invited the Philly Cheese Steak back in 1930. ˜ So Geno's in NOT the original. At both places parking is hard (the are across the street from each other). ˜ Neither place has a parking lot. ˜Both places have a few tables outside. ˜You have to jump in quick when one opens up. ˜Geno's does have a stand up area. ˜Even in the dead of winter it's eat outside or in your car. ˜Both places are open 24 hours a day and every day except Christmas and Thanksgiving. ˜Both have two windows, one for the steak and the other for fries and sodas. ˜You order twice and pay twice. The big difference between the two is the way the meat is prepared. ˜Geno's does not chop up the meat on the grill. ˜ You get the steak in whole slices. ˜The onions at Geno's are also less grilled, they are between raw and grilled. ˜Pat's the onions are grilled. Both places you order Wiz Wit or Wiz Without. ˜That mean with cheese wiz and with or without onions. ˜ Always order it with wiz. ˜I know it sounds gross. ˜Who eats that goopey, neon orange cheese? ˜I would not touch it on anything else, but on a cheese steak it's great. ˜ I have tried it with provolone and it's way too dry. Some people say the bread is different between the two. If that is true it's way too subtle for me to detect. ˜ Of the two I prefer the Pat's cheese steak better. ˜ On a side note, Geno's serves up a little politics with it's steaks. ˜They do not allow you to order in anything other than English. ˜(When is Wiz Wit English?) They also have a lot of articles about immigration and call their fries ""Freedom Fries"", not French Fries. I just want a good cheese steak, stop the lecture on politics!"
7335,9,4,1,6/29/2012,"Okay, as far as cheesesteaks go, this gets a 5. I've had Pat's, Geno's, Jim's and Tony Luc's and Geno's is my favorite. I always go ""cheez wit"" and it's yet to steer me wrong. Just be aware, if you're a socially conscious, liberal individual, this place isn't for you. It's rather xenophobic, and will refuse to serve non-english speakers. But if you speak American English and have your cash ready, you will be rewarded with a delicious cheesesteak."
7336,9,4,1,6/28/2012,"After watching numerous shows and documentaries about the rivalry between Geno's Steaks and Pat's King of Steaks, my BF and I decided to do our own comparison (aprilsims.com/phi...). Both places are located across from one another in South Philly at the crossroads of South 9th Street and East Passyunk Avenue. ˜In the middle of the ""x"" on one side is Pat's and across the street in the middle of the ""x"" is Geno's. It is a strange configuration, however it has been working for this neighborhood since the 60's and as the saying goes ""if it ain't broke, then don't fix it."" From Pat's we ordered ˜a mushroom steak wiz wit. (wiz=Cheese Whiz, wit=with onions) . From Geno's we ordered a steak provolone wit. We sat down at a table halved the subs and began our comparison. TASTE In this food challenge Pat's beat Geno's hands down. The bread from Pat's was soft and warm and the meat was sliced thin, seasoned, juicy and tender. We did not think we would be fans of canned/jar cheese (Cheese Whiz) on a sandwich, however it worked and it was a pleasure to eat. On the other hand the bread from Geno's was a little tough and chewy. Their meat was sliced thicker than Pat's and did not seem to have any flavor even though we had onions and cheese added to our cheesesteaks. CUSTOMER SERVICE I'm big on customer service and this is where Geno's earns it's stars. When it comes down to customer service Geno's won hands down. Their staff was very friendly and seemed to care as well as be delighted that we chose their establishment over the competition. On the other hand, the staff at Pat's was loud and kept screaming next the whole time. They rudely took our order, along with our money and then slid our order through the window and yelled next. This behavior was quite entertaining and was just like I had viewed on PBS specials and other food related shows that featured Geno's and Pat's. AESTHESTICS Geno's was more aesthetically pleasing.Their colors and neon signage was bold and inviting. Reminiscent of food vendors at a carnival. ˜On the other hand Pat's was in a plain white building with vintage (minimal) signage. There was nothing spectacular about the way Pat's looked. We were also impressed that Geno's owned the building across the street from their cheesesteak location that seemed to be dedicated to Geno memorabilia as well as had a memorial in front of their establishment that was dedicated to the fallen Philadelphia firefighters and police officers (more stars and kudos)."
7337,9,3,1,6/26/2012,"After eating a steak at Pats, my buddy wanted to try out Genos. ˜He placed an order for a provolone with. ˜Not sure how much it costs because I grabbed a table while he was ordering. ˜I think it was $8.00 or so. ˜He gave me half the sandwich and it was tasty but not as good as the neighbor across the street. ˜Genos steaks were thinner and more dry. ˜The bread was softer though which I appreciated. ˜The provolone on cheesesteaks really doesn't do it for me for whatever reason. ˜This sandwich did have a lot of onions on it and they were good. ˜Overall though I don't know if I would specifically crave a Genos steak in my life. It was a good/respectable sandwich but far from great."
7338,9,4,1,6/25/2012,"3.5 stars. This is basically just expensive junk food. Kind of like doritos in steak form. It's good, I enjoyed it. But this isn't exactly a food destination in terms of quality or pricing. In my measure Geno's willingness to go the extra inch toward junky-ness put it a notch above Pat's, which was equally as junk-foody but with pretension to being better quality."
7339,9,2,1,6/24/2012,"Tried both after a Sox-Phillies game, and Pat's is better. Server's have an attitude, the sandwich was already wrapped, so when was it made? ˜The texture of the meat was sort of like it was from a roast beef roll. ˜Then I put on the hot sauce, which was my own fault. ˜It is freaking hot! FOr what you pay and what you get, go to Pat's."
7340,9,4,1,6/20/2012,"I love going to Geno's Steaks. Yes, I know it's touristy, but who cares? It's a great experience and a solid cheesesteak from authentic South Philly folks. Pat's across the street is good too, but I still prefer Geno's, even though I'm in the minority."
7341,9,4,1,6/19/2012,"Sorry folks, but I'm a Geno's fan."
7342,9,2,1,6/19/2012,"Don't let the flashy lights and long lines suck you in. ˜Most people in line for Pat's and Geno's either live really close or are from out of town. ˜Trust me. ˜No one who is actually from Philly would drive more than 10 minutes to get one of these steaks. I'm a NE Philly native and Steve's Prince of Steaks in the northeast is the best. ˜Yeah, sure, Pat's and Geno's (I lump them together because they both suck equally and are catercorner from each other) are better than any cheesesteak I'm going to get in Florida, but when it comes down to it, they really do suck. Geno's is a tourist trap with pretty neon lights and pictures of celebrities stopping in for a cheesesteak. ˜Don't fall for it! ˜According to 610 WIP (local sports radio), they were ranked like 50th and 55th out of 60 in the city or something like that. Suggestions: cheesesteaktown.com/40-c? I swear, if I hear one more person not from Philly say, ""What do you prefer, Pat's or Geno's?"" ˜I'm gonna make them watch all of Sylvester Stallone's D-list movies. ˜No, not Rocky, Rambo, or ˜Demolition Man...that's right, I'm talking Shade, Get Carter, and Eye See You."
7343,9,3,1,6/19/2012,"The cheesesteak was good however they were a littl cheap on the quantity of the meat. What I hate about this place is how rude everyone that works there are. I ordered mine with sweet peppers and and whiz when asked if I wanted onions I told them twice no onions. I get my cheesesteak and what was on it onions, I go back to the window and they get annoyed with me. Like really you mess up and its my fault? There are a lot better places then Genos since this is just for tourist."
7344,9,2,1,6/18/2012,"for the tourist..... I'd say. Steak is good quality but I prefer it chopped. Also Who the hell says ""cheese steak wit""... seriously I am from Philly and moved to La 7 years ago. I have never in my life said cheese steak wit. I say what I want and cheese steak with fried onions. If you are around the downtown are or south philly, this is not the place to get a good steak sandwich unless it's after 2am and it is your only option then I would still go across the street to Pats. They are better and with less attitude."

7347,9,2,1,6/15/2012,"Really wanted to like this place and have been wanted to try it ever since it was featured on food network. Sadly this place did not live up to the hype, the Philly Cheese Steak was a huge disappointment, not enough meat, the bread was so so and the meat had some flavor but nothing to come back for. We liked the meat on the sandwich here a little better than Pat's but we weren't impressed with either of them."

7350,9,1,1,6/14/2012,Geno's was awful...onions were not cooked and steak was flavorless. ˜Took two bites and threw the sandwich in the trash. ˜Pat's was only slightly better. ˜These places are tourist traps.

7355,9,1,1,6/6/2012,"Here, you will pay $9 for a plain a**, premade steak sandwich with a side of staff attitude that will make you feel like sh*t. ˜WHY IN THE F*CK DO PEOPLE DO THIS???

5577,9,3,1,6/5/2012,"To preface, I also had Pat's, Jim's, and Cosmis. This was slightly worse than Pat's. Thankfully, both have sliced steak that is not chopped up. This keeps the meat's texture and moisture. While the bread is slightly better than Pat's, it's still soft, boring, white rolls."
7356,9,4,1,6/4/2012,Love it! ˜Got to go to this place.
7357,9,1,1,6/3/2012,"Well that wasn't worth the hype at all, and to add insult to injury, the xenophobic and flat out racist photos and placards made my stomach turn. My friends and I went over to Philly on our Pennsylvania road trip, and a cheese steak was the one thing that I wanted to try. Of course I had seen Geno's and their competitor across the street on TV, so we decided to have our own little Philly cheese steak challenge. Maybe I missed something, but some flavorless meat with some Cheez Whiz on a rubbery bun is this city's signature dish? And if the food wasn't bad enough, looking at placards that say, ""Press 1 for English - Press 2 for Deportation"" and ""This is America. When ordering, SPEAK ENGLISH"" made me physically ill. The utter hypocrisy of some guy who's last name is VENTO with family who OBVIOUSLY came to the US from Italy at some point is enough to make my nose bleed. I would have rather have spent my time going to a museum and just having a Subway sandwich."
7358,9,3,1,5/31/2012,"So i took a bus all the way to Philly for a Cheese steak. I travelled to Pennsylvania for a mediocre sandwich. Once upon a time, i probably would have loved this sandwich. My father would tell me stories from his youth of traveling just for a Philly Chees Steak Sandwich from Geno's. I walked from south street to Geno's. If you go for the walk, do so in the day time. That is all i will say about that. The neon lights are bight and exciting. I studied the menu and went with a Whiz Wit. A philly cheese steak with cheese whiz and onions. Its greasy. Its messy. Its not the best quality. And if you have a sensitive stomach, you will shit yourself. Given that I was totally sober, this experience wasnt amazing. However, i think after a few drinks, I might have a change of heart."
7359,9,3,1,5/30/2012,lots of pictures on the walls....blinking lights everywhere. cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz... everything was very soft and melted together. ˜ pat's is right next door too for comparison
7360,9,1,1,5/29/2012,Really bad served with a healthy side of attitude nothing can save this place just bad...elaborating anymore will just give me agita.
7361,9,1,1,5/29/2012,Pats vs Geno's... Pat's by far. The provolone cheesesteak sandwich was very dry and bland. The meat was flavorless.
7362,9,4,1,5/27/2012,Above average cheesesteak. ˜I didn't go to Pat's so I'm only comparing it to previous cheesesteaks I've had. ˜Steak was cooked well and the bread was super fresh.
7363,9,3,1,5/25/2012,"CHEESESTEAK RATING: B+ Not the best, Not the Worst. They use a sliced steak, good roll and good cheese. Could be better if they gave more meat. Touristy but fun."
7364,9,1,1,5/21/2012,"I ˜was so sickened by the anti-immigrant signage, i ended up ditching my sandwich and heading across the street. This place is so right-wing that they refer to their fries as freedom fries. Unwelcoming atmosphere overall. Skip it."
7365,9,3,1,5/19/2012,Long lines = good food. So true!
7366,9,3,1,5/18/2012,"You have to come here if you are visiting Philly. The lines are crazy if you come during peak hours, but even at 3pm on a Wednesday they are busy! Whiz w/o is my favorite!"
7367,9,1,1,5/18/2012,"You gotta be kidding me. $9 for two pieces of steak on a crappy little roll? This was terrible. Probably the worst cheesesteak I have ever had. Furthermore, the staff was less than enthused to have me as a customer - no ""hello"", ""how can I help you""...just that standard stupid Philly stare that almost makes you feel bad for ordering food. I, in fact, did feel bad that I ordered from them. $2 extra for a small drink - overall the worst $11 I have spent in Philly. The cheese never melted (therefore the meat was not hot), and it tasted horribly stale. The fires were the best part of the meal, but how can you mess up fries? Another $4 by the way. A total of $15 for fries, a drink and a crappy little cheesesteak - no thanks! Go to Jim's - they know cheesesteaks, not this place. Now for a rant - ""This is America, order in English""...while I believe this is a stab at immigrants not assimilating properly and learning our language I firmly believe this is the land of the free. Therefore it is quite possibly they will have visitors (everywhere else in the country we call them tourists) and they may not know English. Our ability to overcome differences and adapt to different languages is part of being America. Not being ignorant, and posting signs everywhere being unwelcoming to new guests to our land. Unless Geno's family were all American Indians they came from somewhere else and were greeted in a manner that made it possible for them to build their enterprise. Grow up, get over yourselves and learn what being American is really about."
7368,9,2,1,5/17/2012,"For the bright and obnoxious decor, I was expecting some exciting cheesesteaks and flavors but was sorely disappointed! Having living near Philly my whole life, I waited until I turned 20 to finally try these famous sandwiches on a random day trip. I ordered the cheesesteak with american cheese and onions (thought I ordered peppers too but didn't get any) and french fries. The meat was in big slices which I did not enjoy as much. The cheesesteak ($9) overall was not bad, but I've had better in this city. Skip the fries too...not worth the $4. It was an experience I wanted to try, but I probably wil not go back for a good sandwich."
7369,9,1,1,5/13/2012,"ALL SHOW and no go. ˜What is all the hype about? ˜I've had better steak subs at Jerry's Subs in the DC area. ˜The meat on the sub almost seems like it was boiled. ˜It was grey with no evidence of being grilled at all. ˜It had no taste. ˜The bread was tough. ˜The onions were overcooked and soggy. ˜All two condiments you could get, you had to put on yourself...mayo from a packet and cherry peppers (whole, with stem)! ˜If there was cheese on the sub, I'd like to know where it was. ˜It was a joke of a sandwich. ˜No wonder South Philly is so tough, if this is what they have to eat. ˜ Then, there were the people behind the counter. ˜They were like zombies. ˜The woman who took our order had zero personality and talked to us like she was a robot. ˜The guy next to her made our sub without ever looking down at what he was doing. ˜It was as though he was doing his best Stevie Wonder imitation. ˜I actually think the guy was blind. Considering the joint does a good deal of business with tourists, like me, you'd think they'd consider being a bit more friendly and welcoming.

To start off, you have to know what you want! Or else you'll end up feeling like an idiot at the end like I did! After waiting in a very long line on a weekend, we were rushed to order and then charged for the sandwiches...no one said stay in line if you want to order more items! So we got out of line. So yeah, I didn't order us drinks or any side orders or even had any toppings :P The service was simply terrible!"
7371,9,2,1,5/8/2012,"I visited Philly Feb' of last year, and I decided to stop here (Before I knew about Yelp, sadly) because it's the touristy thing to do. I wasn't impressed, service was decent and I liked the hot sauce and peppers. To be honest, I've had better philly cheese steaks at hole-in-the-walls around the tristate, but I enjoyed the experience. Didn't go to Pat's it was too busy, and it was too cold and windy."
7372,9,4,1,5/6/2012,"I am not local but I do come to Philly for biz trip almost 6 7 times a year and whenever I am staying over 2 nights I come here with my co workers to eat one. I have to say Geno's is not the best but its a fun experience for tourist. Locals can argue all you want on who has the best cheese steak but for out of towners like us we come to Geno's or Pats because they are the best known to us. Both Geno's and Pats are on the same level so no matter which one you try you will be back for more. I think one of the reason Geno is more famous is because of the order in english only thing and I think the bright orange outside. Anyway try it once and i f you don't like it just move on to others. As far as service you will have to just to deal with their mean attitude, don't let it ruined your experience. enjoy! For parking, I have been here during lunch time, dinner time, weekends, travel season....etc parking is not that hard to find just circle around you will find one."

7376,9,1,1,4/30/2012,I just don't get it why people are so crazy about this philly cheese steak. I won't mind the line and the jammed pack intersection. It reminds me of the philly cheese steak at a bad food court.
7377,9,3,1,4/29/2012,"Listen, I know about this feud going on. I'm from California and we know about it, alright? This review isn't gonna settle the score between Pat and Geno. There are good qualities about both, and to be frank, I prefer Pat's steaks, but Geno's got better customer service (and better quality peppers). Of course, customers could care less about whether or not they got a smile from the guy who took their order, and more about how that cheese steak tastes."

Telling a taxi driver that you want to get to 9th and Pass-y-yunk won't work either. ˜It's pronounced Passhunk. As I wrote at the top, I don't go for the cheese whiz. ˜It's like that Wisconsin joke: ""If you're up late in Wisconsin, it gets so quiet you can hear the cheese whiz."" ˜I don't wanna know about it. ˜Personally, these steaks don't need any oil to add to the grease from the meat. ˜Provolone tastes better. Oh, and if you're health-conscious, go to the grocery store on South Street and get a nice salad. ˜It's a cheese steak place--it's not supposed to be good for you. ˜You're supposed to enjoy the meaty, cheesy goodness. ˜Still, it's something that you shouldn't do more than once a year. I don't know if they're using Amoroso rolls, but the bread is good and the meat's always cooked a little crispy, the way I like it, and the onions (wit!) have been cooking long enough. I'm surprised that the tables never seem dirty. ˜How do they do that? Order the provolone and leave the cheese to whiz in Whizconsin."
5593,9,3,1,4/23/2012,"One word: Grease. A few more words: way overrated. Sorry, Geno's! Sure, you may beat Wawa hoagies in taste, but I hate to break it to you... I've had better. By the time I left the building, I already started feeling a little sluggish -- perhaps from my arteries clogging -- and felt a persistent need to wash my hands because eating it was so messy. This is coming from someone who loves going to all-you-can-eat steak buffets. The Philly cheesesteak may be the iconic foodstuff in the city, but I'd really recommend trying somewhere, or even something, else. If you must go with a hoagie, give Hemo's or Steak Queen foodtrucks a shot, and Magic Carpet and Bui's are just as good too."
7380,9,3,1,4/23/2012,"The negative signs around Genos feels like they've got an attitude problem. ˜ at 9 dollars, they were more $$ than Pat's or Jims. ˜ And the steak was all runny and messey. ˜ ˜ The roll is slighty better here than Pat's. I didn't like the cheese on the bottom and the unchopped steak. Too messy. ˜The staff was friendly though."
7381,9,2,1,4/23/2012,I like Pat's better than here. I came here with my family and we got one cheese steak from here and one from Pat's. The cheese steak here was too dry. The service sucked. They had a really bad attitude. It seemed like they cared more about taking people's money than helping out on what to order. Not coming here again.
7382,9,5,1,4/22/2012,"Loved it! Worth the trip to south philly to try genos for the first time. Cheesesteak ""wit"" with whiz was perfect. Also tried pats too which was across the street to properly compare the two places."
7383,9,4,1,4/15/2012,Geno's is a great place to stop after a Philly's game. Don't let the line intimidate you. It moves quickly.
7384,9,3,1,4/14/2012,"Tried three places for cheese steaks yesterday. The place was cleaner than other cheese stake places and this place serves their steak bits less cut up, which I prefer. My only problems with this place is that the cheese whiz melts too fast so my cheese steak was really runny. But it's still good so I'd probably come back."
7385,9,4,1,4/13/2012,"Wow, surprised by all the negative reviews. ˜Yeah, ˜I realize it's a tourist trap, but the cheesesteak was still very good. ˜I ordered it ""wiz wit,"" and preferred it to Pat's for the following reasons: leaner meat tangier cheez wiz softer roll Thought the guys behind the counter were friendly too. ˜Overall enjoyed the experience."
7386,9,1,1,4/9/2012,"I deeply regret eating here. A few hours after consuming the greasy cheese steak, an unbearable, unsettling pain developed in my stomach. I threw up. In addition to its low quality ingredients coated in grease, the location is less than ideal. Avoid this place at all costs."
7387,9,1,1,4/9/2012,"This place is an eye sore and there cheese steak wasn't that good. And they have no public bathrooms, is that even legal?"
7388,9,1,1,4/8/2012,"Had I only seen ""This is America. Please speak English."" I would have never bothered waiting in line to have a crappy roast pig sandwich. The sandwich was not worth the money - it was a bun with pork; there wasn't anything else in it. I had to force myself to finish 3/4 of the sandwich. The original/beef sandwich was slightly better, but not great."
7389,9,2,1,4/8/2012,"since i just gave the edge to pat's in my previous review, there really isn't too much to say. the whiz was really what put me over the top at the pat's, it seemed to be a bit more whizzy side. i will agree with some others that the bread at geno's was less soggy and had some substance to it, but in a cheesesteak, i would much rather focus on the steak part (i've already elaborated on the cheese). and the steak at geno's just didn't seem to have much flavor to it at all. overall, if you're eating at geno's, you've already made up your mind that you like it more or you're going to walk over to pat's and try a cheesesteak there too and can make up your own mind."
7390,9,2,1,4/7/2012,"I came to Philly to try the ""authentic"" Philly Steak! Cash only- $9 Final thoughts: Delicious but pretty plain. The bread was soft but I wish it was toasted. The sandwich was composed of only sliced steak and grilled onions (that's it). Overall, it was a boring sandwich."
7391,9,2,1,4/7/2012,Good but what really makes it is the roll
7392,9,4,1,4/4/2012,"Steak Sandwich was delicious, but the fries weren't as good as Pats. The Cheese whiz at Genos was better, but my family convinced me to go with Pats! Enjoyed both places though & Philly is lucky to have the two duking it out in there streets!"
7393,9,3,1,4/4/2012,"We wanted to like Pat's more than Geno's, Geno's was obnoxiously lit up, and the ridiculous clearly right wing signs about needing to speak English to order a silly sandwich were downright irritating. ˜But begrudgingly I'll admit, their cheesesteak was better than Pat's. ˜The meat was more juicy (though we wondered if the cheese whiz contributed to it seeming that way) the bread was just as good, and while I was uncertain about whether I'd like it with cheese whiz, it turns out processed cheese-like products are the perfect compliment to a Philly cheesesteak. ˜I still wasn't blown away by the sandwich, but it was the better of the two. ˜However, I gave both places three stars because the atmosphere at Geno's was so much more obnoxious. ˜As a side note, it does have only outdoor seating, and it got chilly quick!"
7394,9,2,1,4/3/2012,"i wish i could have mixed genos and pats. genos had thicker meat, super moist and cheesy. but didnt really have any flavor* and the attitude yea.... im from nyc and even i say thank you and please to the rudest of people."
7395,9,2,1,4/2/2012,Our first stop during our food crawl trip to NYC. ˜Tried both Geno's and Pat's. ˜Both were mediocre and definitely not worth the detour. ˜Should have ˜relied on Yelp in lieu of TV shows.
7396,9,1,1,4/2/2012,"The soup Nazi Packed his bags and moved on out to Philly. The way you are treated here makes a lot of sense since the former proprietor was an avid law enforcement supporter. i.e Move along don't ask any questions. If you do you'll get yelled at by people who think they are better than you because they serve par cheese steaks. You have to know how to order or your par sub or you will be brushed aside and have to wait in line again until you get it. ˜If a business requires ordering instructions it should post them especially for out-of-towners. The steak is Meh... but salvageable with extra condiments. Especially since its mostly bread, and the fries are reminiscent of burger king fries with a tender cardboard after taste. Maybe they are meant to be packaging fillers?"
7397,9,2,1,4/1/2012,This placed is for tourist. They give you a little bit of meat on a big piece of bread. Then charge 9.50. You can get better steaks that come with fries and a soda for that price. Place is good after a night of drinking since its open late. Other than that I don't recommend it.
7398,9,3,1,4/1/2012,Ah the first time I went to genoe I didn't even know cheese steaks are. Now when I go back I have to go. The Cheese whiz is still my fav and the bread is so chewie please don't forget the grilled onions and the hot sauce. The hot sauce is some of the best. Yummy. The prices gone up since I remembered I think it's now at 7.50 each might be 8 now... But don't go too crazy it's not so healthy for a everyday meal:)
7399,9,4,1,3/27/2012,"A friend and wanted to try both Pat's and Geno's. ˜He jumped in line at Pat's, and I at Geno's. ˜The plan was to each get 2 cheese stakes, and then swap one each for a taste challenge. First clue, the length of the lines. ˜Got our steaks from Pats in under 5 minutes. Geno's took 20 + minutes. As far as the stakes go, Geno's was MUCH better all around. ˜ Everything from the cheese, meat,, onions, and even the bun."
7400,9,2,1,3/27/2012,"Let's see what adjectives come to mind when I think of Geno's.... Disrespectful Expensive Fatty Gross Greasy Rude Mean Outdoor seating ONLY Heart attack.... If those words are what you look for in a meal, then you'll love it. ˜It's not for me though. ˜It's not worth the hype. Seriously."
7401,9,4,1,3/25/2012,"ahh, classic rivalry between evil vs good... geno's vs pats, respectively -racist sticker = automatic plus 1 star for the ""idgaf if you order from us or not"" attitude. -i never had a cheesesteak from anyone else after experiencing geno's, bc i feel like i'll be disappointed. ""/ -to me, it was amazonggg if you're in town, hit up this place!! like i said, evil vs good..... come to the dark side"
7402,9,1,1,3/23/2012,Wow! This was REALLY BAD! Luke-warm meat on an average roll. Ordered American cheese. Cheese was put on cold roll with warmish meat. Cheese did not melt. Same problem at Pat's. Go to Steve's Prince of Steaks or Ishkabibbles.
7403,9,1,1,3/20/2012,"Do yourself a favor and just go to the Reading Terminal Market (go to Carmen's or By George), the steaks over there are WAY BETTER. ˜We recently moved to the neighborhood and we wanted to experience ""the famous"" Geno's Steaks. ˜What an awful place, really I don't know how someone could like this. ˜The bread was hard and chewy, the steak was blah and they ˜have the worst fries in the world! I just ended with a heartburn. ˜And if you are not ""american"" just don't go, their political message is offensive and the cashiers and servers are really rude. Never again!"
7404,9,4,1,3/20/2012,"Yes, Geno's Steaks is a tourist trap and yes to grin and bear the long line. ˜It is no doubt, was featured in Food Network or any local media. Yet the steaks are good and Provolone cheese is flavor able. ˜One order of Wiz Cheesesteak Sandwich at $9.00 which gained me more weight was very heavy, but was enjoyable for a one-time splurge indulgence."
7405,9,3,1,3/19/2012,"Went to Philly for the weekend, been seeing these places on t.v since I was young...had to try both.... And let me start by saying, neither knocks your socks off any more than an Al's beef! Genos was good, not amazing as you build it up to be.... Both rivals essentially the same.... So: *lots of bread, kinda skimpy on the meat *not enough cheese wiz! *being really rude and yelling at me to move along, not cute or funny to me.... *letting my sandwich get cold while I wait in separate/continuous lines to get a drink and fries and paying all over again, LAME *cash only, come ON!! ˜People are paying with their phones these days, knock it off! Had to try it once, wouldn't go back.... a better sammie can be had at the reading market at Dinicks,,,"
7406,9,2,1,3/16/2012,"tried it because it was famous. it was alright, but not awesome, Pat's across the street was better. if i remember right, Geno's doesn't cut up the meat enough and Pat's did, which did make a difference. ˜had better from my own cousin who live's there. next time i'm in philly, i'll try to find a better steak spot."
7407,9,3,1,3/14/2012,"I stand firm that Pat's has better cheesesteaks, but as a cheesesteak joint in South Philly, Geno's has to be noted. ˜It's flashier, the lights burn brighter, and they catch your attention even if it's not your cheesesteak place of choice. ˜Their fries are better than Pat's, I'll give them that. ˜They have the attitude of Philly and the standard to-be-expected line of local Philadelphians at any hour. ˜Honestly, if I were a tourist (and I'm not), I'd try both Geno's and Pat's. ˜Decide for yourself. ˜Besides, you can never eat too many cheesesteaks. ˜(You could also give Tony Luke's a shot.)"
7408,9,4,1,3/13/2012,"Okay, I DEFINITELY like Geno's better than Pat's. I feel like people are in favour of Pat's because they are not flashy, but let's just face it-- the meat at Geno's is more flavorful, cheese is better, and the bread is not flaky and PERFECT. Geno's tastes much more fresh that Pat's and the service is SOOOO much better than at Pat's. Hands down my favorite in Philly! And yes, I've tried Jim's too... I am just a fan of Geno's, and that's that."
7409,9,2,1,3/11/2012,"After moving to PA, I made it my personal mission to go to Philly for the famous cheesesteaks. After reading many reviews I decided to go to Geno's over Pat's. Forced my friends to road trip from Allentown to Philly with the sole mission of having cheesesteaks. It was a cold winter night and I was completely unaware that Geno's did not have indoor seating. After an 1 hour and change of traveling we arrived to quickly order our food (be prepared and know the lingo or you will get attitude) and eat in the car. I got a cheesesteak with wiz. I personally didn't think it was bad, but definitely didn't think it was amazing. The company I was with was not a fan and definitely did not think it was worth the journey. They found it overpriced and was not aware that it was cash only. Everyone agreed the bread was good, but that's about it. If I was in the philly area I would probably go again, but since I don't, I probably won't be going there again. Peace and cheesesteak grease, Domi B."
7410,9,5,1,3/10/2012,"On my recent trip to Philly, I put together a personal cheesesteak challenge to find my favorite cheesesteak in Philadelphia. The three contenders were what I think are the most famous cheesesteak restaurants in Philadelphia, Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's. I will start off by saying that I enjoyed the sandwiches at all three spots, very much. I ordered the cheesesteak the exact same way at each restaurant so it would be a fair comparison, with Wiz and no onion. ˜ I will rate the cheesesteaks on their own, on each restaurants individual Yelp page. In my personal opinion, here is how they finished. 1. Geno's 2. Jim's 3. Pat's Why did Geno's finish first? With only three ingredients making up these sandwiches, there wasn't a lot to compare. The steak on the Geno's sandwich was the only one of the three that was in larger pieces, which I liked better. The steak on the Jim's and Pat's sandwiches were chopped up into finer pieces. ˜ The Wiz on the sandwich at Geno's was a generous volume and evenly distributed on the sandwich. The bread at Geno's was comparable to the bread at Pat's, but wasn't as good as the bread at Jim's. I'd say that this was the only ingredient of the three that Geno's didn't have the edge. Best steak, best Wiz volume, and pretty good bread gives Geno's the crown of my cheesesteak challenge."
7411,9,4,1,3/10/2012,"Okay so Geno's is bright, flashy and good. ˜Get ready to stand in line. ˜Their menu is simply ˜cheesesteak, fries and sodas. ˜There is out door seating with photos of celebrities who have patronized Geno's. ˜Cheesesteaks at Geno's have sliced beef and not chopped. ˜They load up the bun with sliced steak and your choice of cheese. ˜You should walk across the street to try the competitor and choose the best for yourself. Good luck with finding street parking during peak hours."
7412,9,5,1,3/10/2012,"Ashamed to admit that I didn't know until yesterday that Geno's is open all the time. En route to PHL airport to catch a 10:30 flight, our cabbie made a side-trip to Geno's and was nice enough to let us eat our steaks in the cab. ˜I'd recommend lots of napkins for mobile wiz-wit consumption, because the Geno's wiz-wit is juicy-on-steroids. Generous wiz and onions. ˜Best breakfast I've had in a while."
7413,9,2,1,3/8/2012,it is all hype. if you have geno's ˜you better make sure you have pat's as well because pat's is better. geno's steaks are lazy. they dont bother chopping it up which i really do not like. the meat was overdone and rather chewy. just not as tasty as pat's. cross the street!
7414,9,4,1,3/6/2012,You can't miss the lights or the 200 people waiting in line. Wish I could of got double meat but their way has been working all these years who am I to change it up. Get the cheese fries too.
7415,9,3,1,2/29/2012,"So my girl and I decided to make a run to Philly for their famous cheesesteaks. ˜We got down there and walked to that famous corner where Geno's and Pat's stare eachother down. ˜Both places had HUGE lines but Geno's was a bit shorter so we decided to start off there. ˜After our first cheesesteak fix we crossed the street to Pat's. ˜ Personally i did enjoy both; however, Pat's steak seemed to be sliced thicker and when you bit into the sandwich you could definitely tell that there was more steak in ˜Pat's cheesesteak. ˜ Pat's is the winner!"
7416,9,5,1,2/28/2012,I love Geno's. Every time I go to Philly we stop here. Definitely better than Pat's in my opinion.
7417,9,4,1,2/26/2012,"Out of my top 3 favorite philly cheesesteak places, Geno's ranks 2nd. The roll is always soft and my wiz wit is always consistently good. I also love their cheese fries."
7418,9,2,1,2/24/2012,"Just okay. I think I prefer my meat chopped up. I liked their hot sauce - VERY hot. Obviously, xenophobia is hard to swallow, even with a nice helping of wiz and onions. I'm glad I tried it, but I'll stick with Jim's."
7419,9,3,1,2/23/2012,"Its a decent cheese steak but not as good as Pats. ˜The meat and bread are the biggest differences. ˜I say try both but I prefer Pats. ˜Geno's was just ""Ok""."
7420,9,3,1,2/18/2012,"I would like to first state that I have dreamed of traveling to Philly and trying a ""real cheesesteak"" sandwich since I was about 10 years old. ˜As an adult, I know that the most popular places are not always the best nor most authentic. ˜What do you visit Geno's for? ˜The experience & the photo-op would be the most obvious answer. ˜If you have a friend that is a local, he or she will probably kindly accompany you to Geno's; but, will then recommend a better spot down the street or a neighborhood away. ˜ Knowing this, I still ordered a cheesesteak with Provolone & put everything on it (including cherry peppers). ˜I also ordered the cheese-fries. ˜Eating this reminded me of a Saturday baseball game, and my gastric anticipation was quietly settled. ˜The steak was unseasoned, and I thought I would get a larger variety of toppings (like sauteed mushrooms & peppers). ˜I was wrong. ˜I was a tourist. ˜I was making a mental note to make sure that I stop by Pat's at the beginning of my next trip, and then finish said trip with a ""real cheesesteak spot"". ˜ I admired all the pictures of famous people on the walls. ˜(""ooh President... ooh Oprah... ooh so-and-so"") ˜The line wasn't that long, and we did get a table. ˜I took a pic in front of the neon sign in the daylight, and that was about it. ˜925 reviews, and a legacy to support it. ˜The owner passed last year, I believe.. and I'm sure he ˜wanted to ensure that Geno's would be around forever... As far as the xenophobic sign on the window, patriotism is only so far from ignorance at times. ˜We are all immigrants, in some way. ˜Philadelphia knows that well. ˜The Italian community should. ˜Blatantly stating ""Speak English"" is unnecessary at a glorified sandwich deli. ˜When ordering from the menu, printed in English, what other language could one speak? ˜I didn't let this deter me from ordering my food, but I wasn't surprised that the sign was posted. ˜Out of all the other -isms that have negative connotations, tourism is one that we really can control. ˜They've only typed what many people vocalize every day. ˜I just want more toppings and some seasoning - so I'll definitely patronize another place next time."
7421,9,2,1,2/17/2012,"Ah yes... The Pats and Genos battle... I will have to say that Pats wins... Hands down. I do not like that Genos doesn't have chopped steak, and the taste wasn't all that great either! I recommend if you are hungry enough try them both! You will then decide what you like. I just know that I do not like trying to eat a steak sub and the meat come off in a few bites because it was not chopped."
7422,9,3,1,2/16/2012,"Doesnt live up to the hype. Not enough meat in the bun. Bun was a bit dry. Cheese wiz and onions were good, steak was very flavorful but not enough of it, hard to eat since its not sliced/shredded but I did think the meat tastes betters non shredded. Go to Jims if you want a true philly cheese steak."
7423,9,3,1,2/15/2012,"Compared to Pat's, this one takes the backseat. And it must be compared as both restaurants have been rivaling each other from the beginning. The steak is not as flavorful. Hey, they still got my money, just not my vote!!"
7424,9,4,1,2/10/2012,"Over 900 reviews will tell you that they are doing something right. ˜Many haters on here complain of racism, which is ridiculous. ˜The commission that looked into everything after all the controversy found no violation of any ordinance. ˜So what if he wants people to order in English, the language spoken by the employees. ˜So many of Philly folks have relatives who were immmigrants and who assimilated. ˜I have a feeling that many have let their politics get in the way of a good tradition and a good competition. ˜I suspect many may have come to write 1 star reviews and perhaps never even ate here. The bottom line is that it is not a one star sandwich. ˜The competition makes both Pats and Genos better, and truly creates a fun and ˜iconic landscape to get a cheesesteak. ˜And if my opinion counts...yeah I think Pat's wins....but I won't ever forget the experience of my times in Philly going head to head."
7425,9,3,1,2/9/2012,Average tourist trap. the pictures and glitz are here but you want a better meal goto Pats.
7426,9,2,1,2/7/2012,"I give 1 star for the lights and 1 star for yelling at me after I bought a cheesesteak from you... I've had cheesesteak in California better then Genos.. In fact, I bet ill make a better cheesesteak then Genos.... Definitely overhyped...."
7427,9,2,1,2/6/2012,"Unfortunately, between Pat's and Geno's, I believe Pat's wins. The cheesesteak at Geno's is a bit more dry and more tough. The steak doesn't quite combine with the bread, making it a juicy, warm, gooey sandwich, instead each ingredient stays relatively separate. The neon lights, flashy posters, and offensive signage don't help the experience."
7428,9,1,1,2/3/2012,"HUGE disappointment! ˜I have no idea how this place even landed a spot on the food network. ˜There was no line when I went, so service was quicker than the blink of an eye. ˜ You can see through the windows that all the meat were pre cooked and was just sitting there on the grill. ˜First disappointment. ˜ Second disappointment, they didn't even chop up all the meat and just served them as slices. ˜What can of cheesesteak is this!? Third disappointment, sandwich wasn't even hot - luke warm. ˜ Fourth disappointment, taste was awful! My whole process was just a huge disappointment throughout. ˜I did not just take a $10 cab ride here to eat a tasteless and cold sandwich. ˜I would much rather eat a Great Steak Sandwich inside a mall than to come here. ˜I was pretty upset and will never come back!"
7429,9,4,1,2/2/2012,"Geno's suffers from being over exposed and hyped, but really from a purely impartial standpoint, their steaks are above average. ˜I think the steak itself is a 3.5 star product, but their hot sauce earns a star just by itself. ˜It's one of the best (and spiciest restaurant hot sauces I've encountered). Give it a shot, the hot sauce makes the steak twice as good. ˜Be forewarned to add it sparingly -- it is hella hot. ˜If you think of hot sauces on a scale of 1 to 10, where Frank's Red Hot is a 1.5 and Tabasco is a 3. ˜The Geno's hot sauce is a 7."
7430,9,2,1,2/2/2012,"What was once a past favorite is now an over-hyped tourist trap. Lines get really long, mostly due to its attractive lights and its mural of celebrity encounters. The cheesesteaks are warm at best, the beef was sliced and had no flavor what so ever, the provolone cheese wasn't melted, and the onions were raw. That's pretty much everything you can do to ruin a cheesesteak. Not to mention the service is horrible, they're rude and they look down on customers that can't speak English well. The fries are decent but if you want a more satisfying cheesesteak, just go across the street to Pat's. If this review hasn't deterred you enough to not want to try Geno's, then bring cash because they don't accept credit. Similar to Pat's, covered seating is available outdoors."
7431,9,2,1,2/1/2012,"I drove from NY to try the Philly cheese steaks with whiz (also stopped at Pat's). ˜After having them (both Geno's and Pat's) I wouldn't drive down the street for them, let alone for two hours. There was nothing remarkable about these sandwiches (other than the hype and cost)."
7432,9,2,1,1/31/2012,Go else where for a cheesesteak. There are better options. The regular sandwich has a so-so bun and the meat was dry. The fries were average. Overrated; went there based on the name only. Go else where.
7433,9,2,1,1/30/2012,"Grumpy cliental, a mediocre cheesesteak, and high prices sum up the Geno's experience. One of the better tourist traps, but that's not saying a lot. If you have the crave, it will get the job done but not very well. Bigger, better, and cheaper steaks can be purchased at most other South Jersey pizza shops and bars. Don't say I didn't warn you."
7434,9,1,1,1/30/2012,"If you think Geno's cheese steak is good then sorry to say, you've been BRAINWASHED. The rolls are chewy and as hard as my sandals. The beef is pre-sliced and dry! And this sloppy made overpriced cheese steak taste really bland! I rather get a cheese steak from my corner chinese restaurant, they taste better!"
7435,9,3,1,1/28/2012,"We drove all the way from Virginia just to get a cheesesteak fix. ˜Personally, I preferred Pat's but decided to go here because it had a bunch of bright lights. ˜The line was long but it went by fast. ˜I got the wiz without which means wiz cheese and without onions or peppers. ˜I also got an order of fries with wiz. ˜The fries were great at first but became soggy because of the cheese. ˜I would recommend getting them plain because they taste good by themselves. Overall, this was better than your average and I do think it's worth one trip in a lifetime to try the Geno and Pat challenge. ˜Other than that I wouldn't be coming up here anytime soon."
7436,9,2,1,1/26/2012,Cold and chewy cheesesteak. Got it within 5 seconds of ordering. Cash only. 9$. Pat vs geno's? None. Both suck
7437,9,1,1,1/24/2012,If you like bad cheese steaks and racists this is the place for you. If not go somewhere else.
7438,9,3,1,1/21/2012,"The steak is flat sliced not shredded. The place is flashy with the lights, glits and glam but Pat's is much better!"
7439,9,5,1,1/20/2012,"I've been going into the city for the past 4 years and in that time, I have been able to try all of the finer cheesesteak establishments this great city has to offer. This being said, Geno's Steaks has never disappointed. The slabs of beef, combined with fried onions, and cheese whiz all on a delicious amoroso roll allows this cheesesteak haven to bypass Pat's, John's, Steve's, or any other of the hundreds of local steak sandwhich purveyors. If this is your first time in the city, this place is a can't miss."
7440,9,1,1,1/19/2012,"Despite the hype and television coverage ( the nonesense of Food Network should tell it all) this is NOT the traditional Philadelphia cheesesteak,. Like the steaks across the street at Pat's this is not at all what most Philadelphian's know as a steak sandwhcih. These steaks are tough and flat. ˜No real steak uses cheeze wiz. A real steak is ""scrambled"" the meat is broken down, shreaded. And the cheese is real. go to any corner place to fine the real thing."
7441,9,2,1,1/18/2012,"This review might not be fair. Not because we have anything against Geno's, but because we tried his neighbor's steaks and were extremely satisfied. The bar was set high, and Geno's had a tough job to do. I can't say much about Geno's. It wasn't piping hot, the beef was sliced and had no flavor at all, the provolone cheese was practically missing, and the onions were raw. Neither of these were appealing to my significant other and I. In fact, we had to order some lemonade to wash down the dryness of the steak. The only thing that might be superior at Geno's is the bread, which doesn't make up for the other things. I'm not sure if it was just a bad night at Geno's or what, because we were largely disappointed with what we experienced here. To make things worse, the bigotry that includes the signs all over the place is extremely disheartening. In a country that is proud of diversity, it felt terrible to see signs saying that you could only order in English. Is that why there were no Hispanic employees at Geno's and a few at Pat's? I would hypothesize that Geno's is of Italian descent, so why do they need to post ridiculous signs all over their ordering windows? All of the political jibberish aside, we really did not find anything appealing about the cheesesteak. Extremely dry, sliced meat accompanied with little cheese and raw onions completely ruined the experience. I don't think we will be coming back here."
7442,9,1,1,1/16/2012,"Go to PATS, Genos is a sad sad excuse for a Philly Sandwich. ˜Got an ICE cold cheese steak that was DISGUSTING!, ˜People at the window, just laughed when we tried to get a new steak. ˜Super RUDE, fat and cocky workers. ˜Definitely not the OG steak shop, ˜go to Pats, Jims, or Tony Lukes"
7443,9,1,1,1/16/2012,"This place wasn't very good. It is basically a mere average cheese steak priced for tourists. ˜Philadelphia totally let me down with this historic eatery. Also, I took off a star for the offensive sign that reads something like: ""This is America, speak English""... I totally regret buying a sandwich to support this bigotry. For an equally mediocre sandwich without the flag waiving bullshit, check out Pat's across the street."
7444,9,1,1,1/13/2012,"I wish I could give this place 0 stars. One of the most appalling dining experiences of my life. Workers aren't friendly but that is to be expected with places like this. Food is just OK which is also to be expected. But the owner decorates the joint with racist and far right wing propaganda. NOT WHAT I WANT TO SEE WHEN IM WITH FAMILY TRYING TO ENJOY A MEAL. He is entitled to his opinions, but he should keep those racist stickers and signs out of my face when I am giving him MY business. Absolutely abysmal. Never again."
7445,9,2,1,1/11/2012,"Disappointing, kind of a tourist trap I dont locals come here. Bland taste, nothing special about the meat, the bread, or the cheese. Its worth coming once to say you went. Food is not terrible but underwhelming. I dont plan on returning. If i am back in philly, i will try out the higher rated local cheesesteak chains on yelp."
7446,9,3,1,1/4/2012,"Let the battle begin!! On a cold (cold for a Cali boy) day in Philly I ventured over to South Philly for a Philly cheese steak off. The contenders? ˜Gino's Vs Pat's. ˜While in the huge line I did my research so that I could order my sandwich the true Philly way. ˜Here's a cheat sheet for you! (anyone correct me if I'm wrong) 1st Say: ""I'd like a cheese steak"" Then the type of cheese ""wiz"" ""provalone"" or ""American"" Then ""wit"" or ""with out"" Then enjoy! I enjoyed Gino's better then Pat's. It had more flavor, the bun was soft and buttery and the service was a little kinder. ˜I know a lot of people are angered at the ""order in English"" signs but they don't bother me at all. ˜Bring cash as they don't accept anything else."
7447,9,2,1,1/3/2012,"cheesesteaks arent my thing but this place was okay... the wait in the cold, the cash only, and the xenophobia of this ˜place aren't worth what you get and especially what youre paying for."
7448,9,1,1,1/1/2012,"Craptacular. ˜Racist workers and horrible service. ˜Bread was better than at Pat's, but nothign else. ˜(Pat's is prertty bad too, dont get me wrong.) ˜Meat was horribly dry. ˜Oversalty with the cheese whiz. ˜So simple to make a philly but somehow they drop the ball here. ˜Definitely would advise friends against wasting time here. ˜I don't see how people can enjoy eating something like this. ˜I'm normally not this harsh, but seriously, grow soem taste buds. ˜This food is horrible. ˜I don't get how it's popular."
7449,9,1,1,12/31/2011,"(1.75 stars) ˜Gino's is one of the two iconic cheesesteak stands of Philadelphia, and sits across S 9th Street from Pat's-- the original. ˜Being iconic, however, says nothing about quality or the dining experience. ˜Let's look at the dining experience first. ˜Under the best of circumstances you order from a long outdoor counter, and have a foil-wrapped sandwich literally thrown at you moments later. ˜The counter isn't wiped as frequently as hygiene would dictate, and there are few places to sit and eat. ˜Add to this the fact that the counter help is predictably gruff and short-tempered. ˜It would take some remarkable food to create a dining environment that any sane person would want to repeat. ˜Unfortunately, the cheesesteaks just don't measure-up. ˜The meat is both loaded with gristle and cooked to the point of being dry. ˜I prefer melted provolone and onions, and the cheese has always been only partially melted. ˜I've eaten at four of Philly's ""big name"" cheesesteak spots (Geno's, Pat's, Jim's and Dalessandro's), and believe that Geno's is the worst of the four."
7450,9,2,1,12/28/2011,"Went all the way to Philadelphia for this, so disapointed. Guess ill go run the Rocky stairs..."
7451,9,5,1,12/27/2011,The cheesesteaks are really good.. The line is long..
7452,9,5,1,12/23/2011,"If you are going here for good service and non-greasy food, then you have a problem. ˜The ruggedness (not rudeness) of the staff is something I love and I think it's fun. ˜They don't mess around here. ˜Yes this place is a tourist trap where it's not really worth it to pay ~$10 for a cheesesteak with fries. ˜But, it's an institution and for that price, I'm willing to spend in the double digits for some shaved meat wit whiz and onions."
7453,9,2,1,12/22/2011,"**Tourist Trap** My nephew wanted to go to Geno's. See he is a Cheesesteak aficionado and has never had Geno's. Ive been here before but it was some time ago. This place survives on reputation. They have all kinds of crazy signage most of them with a slight racist theme. Also a bunch of Cop badges, firefighter stuff etc. Joey Vento use this as a ploy . Im sure the man didnt really give a hoot about cops,firefighters etc. It was just business to him. Anyways the cheesesteaks are bland no flavor the amount of meat is well not enough. The steak itself was cold we sat down right after it was served an ate and it was cold. We ordered cheesefries they where cold as well. The guy on the ""french fry"" window was kool. The other 2 older ladies at the steak line where as cold as the steak. ˜The only good thing was there was actually no line. Do yourself a favor go to Pats instead. Pat's isnt the best in the city, but is much better than Geno's cold cow tail steak. Its definitively not worth the $9 which i found a little steep for the amount of meat you get. Perhaps this wouldnt have bother ˜me as much if it was good."
7454,9,4,1,12/21/2011,"This was the first Philly cheesesteak I had ever had, and after doing a taste test multiple times, comparing Jim's and Pat's with Geno's, Geno's still wins. To the people saying it is too greasy... newsflash, you're eating a cheesesteak. It is buttery, delicious bread with melted cheese (I get the whiz wit - cheese whiz and grilled onions) and shaved meat on it. If you don't want it greasy, you have issues. I took off a star because the quality of their meat isn't as good as it could be, for instance, as good as Pat's. If I could take Pat's meat (that sounded bad...) and have everything else be like Geno's, it'd be a perfect steak. The attitude from the staff sort of comes with the territory. You're in south Philly. I know that's a poor excuse, but I really don't care if they are short to me. They keep the line (and there's always a looong line) moving and everyone gets their food in a timely manner. Win!"
7455,9,3,1,12/21/2011,Hardly worth the $9 for the whiz. Was pretty damn tasty tho.
7456,9,3,1,12/21/2011,"Worse service than the one across the street, guys are not warm and not friendly, I mean not friendly at all. ˜ Cheesesteak is not fussy - but i did goof ˜- I ordered whiz wit' - should have dropped the whiz - kinda overpowered the steak - more meat than accross the street too. Pat's and Geno's thing was neat to do. ˜I expected more tourists than what I saw -- but I guess locals like them too.?"
7457,9,4,1,12/20/2011,"Thank You Geno for blessing the street with your sandwich; why did I not come here instead of Pats in the first place??? I made my way over here a week after Geno died, very sad to hear of his passing. I am so glad I finally got to try this sandwich. The bread was friggin perfect, fresh but chewy goodness. I once again had it wit onions (you have to say wit, not with or you may get mistreated) and the wiz. I know there are many people who would never try fake orange melty cheese on their steak sandwich but it really works well, it creates this creamy saltiness that is undeniably wonderful. In fact, the bites with no wiz just don't burst flavor as the ones with it. Trust me on this. I literally enjoyed every bite of this sandwich. I am so stoked I got to eat here."
7458,9,5,1,12/19/2011,"I tried the big 3- Geno's, Pat's, and Jim's on South St, but Geno's won by a landslide!"
7459,9,4,1,12/18/2011,"Not only is it a Philly institution, it's called ""Geno's."" What more you want?"
7460,9,1,1,12/15/2011,this place is the worst. the cheese steaks here are so dry! i had to drench it with ketchup to help me swallow this beast! ˜i guess you don't have to make good cheese steaks if your building has blinking light's showcasing the restaurant name..... do yourself a favor and go to jim's steaks in south street. stay away from this tourist trap!
7461,9,3,1,12/15/2011,I know it's a landmark of sorts but I really liked Pats better. I prefer chopped over slices and it could really use a healthy dose of seasoning!
7462,9,4,1,12/13/2011,"My first Philly cheese steak experience. Had a ""whiz wit,' ""and It was dam good. The meat wasn't cut up, and it wasn't all greasy like Pat's. The bread held everything together perfectly."
7463,9,2,1,12/12/2011,I used to be a Geno's guy but it seems just ok. I would not drive out of my way to come here again. ˜Disappointing. What happened?
7464,9,1,1,12/10/2011,"Awful. Clear contempt for the customer. Terrible people working here - just the worst service I have seen. I felt I was doing them a favor by patronizing their shop. After ordering 4 cheesesteaks - 2 prov/2 American, ""with"" (onions) I went to order fries and sodas at the next window. Lady didn't want to help, asked me ""is that all you want?"", ""are you sure now?"" with attitude like woahhh. Another patron was told not to use napkins from the stall b/c he was carrying a pats steak, although he also had one from Geno's in hand. Staff is not customer-friendly, especially for a place that considers itself (or should) a tourist spot. The food itself is garbage. Tepid meat, greasy, greasy onions. Nothing else offered. To give you an idea of the kind of place this is, flyers on the window read: ""Speak English, this is America"" ˜ ˜ and ""I want my country back!"" I didn't like this place."
7465,9,2,1,12/7/2011,"Ate here with my fiance a few months ago. We each went to an establishment- me to Geno's, he to Pat's. I thought the workers were extremely rude and kind of mean. Not to mention all the racist stuff all around, even though I definitely saw a person of Hispanic decent working there- like HELLO? The price was rather high... the soda's were rather small. Then we ate. We tried to be as scientific as possible, each of us eating half of our respective cheesesteaks. The winner is definitely PAT'S However, the best place for cheesesteaks in Philly is Tony Lukes!"
7466,9,3,1,12/7/2011,"I initially wanted to try Pat's Famous Cheesesteaks but the flashy lights and signs of Geno's Steaks drew me in. The service was ""blah"". I told the counterperson it was my first time eating at Geno's and she looked like she could care less. I was hoping by telling her it was my first time that she would offer some suggestions, tell me about the menu...something. But nada. Anyways, I ordered the ""Whiz Wit"" (Philly cheesesteak with cheese whiz w/ onions). I was expecting the steak to be chopped up but it wasn't. It doesn't really matter but I just thought that's how a Philly cheesesteak was prepared. It was good but I didn't get the hype with Geno's. Next time I'll try Pat's to compare."
7467,9,3,1,12/7/2011,"Was in town on business and figured I'd check this off my ""Eating Tour of America"" list. ˜I got the ""Whiz with"" and it was a pretty good sandwich. ˜Was it worth $9? ˜No- but then again, that's part of the price for saying that you've had one of their cheese steaks. ˜I wish I would have had the appetite to run over to Pat's and do a comparison."
7468,9,1,1,12/5/2011,"drove all the way from the ""bronx"" new york to try this place out. should have read the reviews first. whenever there are negative reviews, the food or place is usually lousy. thank-god there was no line. had no clue that you had to order a sandwich at one window and go the a different one to purchase a drink. the woman at the front counter was nasty. paid $9.00. for a couple of slices of dry, fatty, tasteless beef..the bread and onions were no bargain as well..knew that 'adam"" of ""man vs. fool"" would not know anything about food unless it hit him in the back of his head. would never go back nor recommend..how to people rave about places like this?? moreover, stay in business?? had better cheese steaks ay ny local diner, parx racetrack and atlantic city. was very, very dissapointed.. would never go back..awful...a big double two thumbs down.. this is ""a review you can trust!"" did enjoy the neighborhood and decor of the place..felt like I was back in the bronx, brooklyn or downtown manhattan. next time, will try pat's and spend the day walking around the streets of south philly! = )"
7469,9,4,1,12/2/2011,"Better than most, just not Pat's. Their bread was so fresh, but they rely on their Hollywood photos to draw a crowd of onlookers to see who patronizes their steaks. They are flashy, but it is just a flash in the pan for me. Go across the street and try one of Pat's side by side and you'll taste the difference."
7470,9,1,1,11/29/2011,its ashame that people come to this city just to go to genos .there are so many places around that are better (plillips steaks 23 passyunk) by the way to the out of towners they are racist against people with an accent.and you do not get your money's worth
7471,9,1,1,11/28/2011,"not a fan for many, many reasons"
7472,9,1,1,11/27/2011,"Crap, tourist trap, not filling. The best thing on the menu are the cheese fries. I've had better Philly Cheese Steaks in Ft. Lauderdale."
7473,9,4,1,11/25/2011,I love philly cheesesteaks. I don't particularly have a favorite. When I am in Philly I always head down to Passyunk and stop by either Geno's or Pat's. Geno's is the glitzier of the two. Its a bit more greasy and the steak is not chopped like Pat's....but who cares?....I love it.
7474,9,1,1,11/25/2011,"terrible customer service, rude cashiers, long lines, no parking, I got a ""whiz wit"" and it was terrible, no flavor, TOO EXPENSIVE! $9 who are they kidding! seriously we got three sandwiches two fries and two drinks for like $45 WTF! definitely will not eat here again, it's just minute steak on a bun I can make that at home!"
7475,9,3,1,11/24/2011,"I prefer Geno's over Pat's because of the beef slices (vs chopped beef), but it's still not that flavorful. ˜Geno's does get points for having good hot sauce for folks like me who don't ever eat anything without condiments. ˜Got the Cheez Whiz with onions for a head-to-head comparison. ˜The cheese was not as plentiful, but the beef was juicier. ˜It's a shame I did not get to meet Joey Vento (R.I.P.). ˜ I will not return here, but it's a must for tourists and I can say I've been there. ˜:)"
7476,9,2,1,11/23/2011,"Meh. Not as good as Pat's (see my review on Pat's), but I think it really comes down to personal preference when judging these behemoths of cheesesteaks. What I did like about Geno's, was that it seemed like a classier joint. But, in the same sense that a south Vegas strip club is slightly classier than an Atlantic City strip club. So, don't get too excited there. It just seemed more clean and sanitary than Pat's. I was a little less worried about catching some disease from eating the food. what I didn't like about Geno's: - the baguette was soft, and not toasty like Pat's - the onions were massive chunks, not finely chopped... I'm not a fan of the onion, so this was a MASSIVE turn-off - the beef is sliced, and not chopped - it also seemed like the sandwich was slightly smaller than the cheesesteak at Pat's, and less filling as a result The neighborhood around Pat's and Geno's is quite sketchy and borderline-ghetto. We were lucky to score a parking spot on Reed Street about 2 blocks away from both establishments. But, certainly not the kind of place you'd want to be walking alone on a Saturday night."
7477,9,2,1,11/23/2011,"My friend was visiting from out of town, and we did the traditional Pat's and Geno's cheesesteak trek. We went a bit before noon, and parking wasn't as bad as I expected- it is all street parking, but we managed to get a spot only a block away. There wasn't much of a line by the time we got there, but when we were leaving around 12:10/12:15, a line was already forming. The decor is pretty tacky, to say the least. The service guys all seemed like they were smirking at you, but we got all our food in about 30 seconds, which was pretty impressive. The racist signs around the place were pretty off-putting, and I think they should really reconsider that- after reading the signs, I'd be really hesitant to ever go back (for example: ""Press 1 for English, press 2 for deporation""). There's really a line between patriotism and ignorance, and Geno's managed to cross incredibly far into ignorance. We ordered cheese fries, a diet coke and a cheesesteak with American cheese and onions. The ordering system was a bit confusing- there were different windows for different things (i.e. order the cheesesteak at one window, pay, then move to a different window to order the fries, pay, etc.) and the signage wasn't clear. The cheesesteak was $9, which was prettttty steep. The meat on the cheesesteak was gray-ish, and were cut into long slices. The onions were large-ish chunks, and not really cooked well. The roll was so greasy that looked wet, and the bread on one end actually was wet from grease. We had to get napkins and blot it off, and we went through a good number of napkins before we felt the cheesesteak was digestible. The American cheese, however, was tasty. The cheesefries were mostly just fries with some cheez whiz on it, and weren't too bad- although all the cheese whiz sunk to the bottom, so the top didn't really have much on it and the bottom had so much that the fries were stuck together. I might go back if I had another friend visiting who wanted to try Pat's and Geno's, especially since they are right across the street from each other. But there's really no other reason to go here- the food isn't good, the food is overpriced, and the obnoxious signs are really off-putting."
7478,9,1,1,11/19/2011,"In all of my time here on Yelp I have only ever written one review before -- most of my time here is to spent promoting my business in NYC and deciding whether or not to be a patron at a local bar/restaurant/etc. But man! I'm all mad and wanting to rant! So here it goes (*ahem*) My sister recently moved to Philadelphia from Atlanta, and so I'm here for a weekend getaway. She being new and me being hungry almost always, she suggests we participate in the little tourist trap that consists of eating a lot of cheese steak from places that are kind of old and then deciding which one is the best, a.k.a: the Pat's versus Geno's showdown. My Verdict: Neither of them are really all that, but of the two it's definitely Pat's. Plain and simple, their cheese steak is just much, much better. Geno's bread is hard, they don't put enough cheese, the steak itself is mediocre. Dude, it's really just not good. I mean, you could very easily make something more delicious at home and not get in a panic that you're going to order it wrong and be sent to the back of the line. Cause they do that there, apparently. And you know what that's just rude! But hear me out cause that's not why I'm all mad and stuff. Because it's after the 30 minute wait in the cold -- yet before the first bite of plllllppp cheesesteak -- that the fury begins. Because in that window of time, ladies and gentlemen, you're surrounded by shamelessly RACIST propaganda all over the walls of the actual establishment. Have you ever seen a person or a place actually boast about being a complete racist? It's strange, it's unsettling, and if I didn't have a healthy appetite almost always I would probably say unappetizing. A bunch of bigots, I say! Bloody bigots! So what I suggest is to, honestly, forget the tourist trap all together. Ask a local where the REAL cheese steak is, because I'm telling you this place ain't it by a long shot. ˜But if you just gotta go for the experience nonetheless, in the very least go to Pat's first when you're actually hungry for semi-decent food. I say order a ""wit whiz"" and grab a couple hot peppers to spice up the experience. Ketchup on the side is also nice. Ask for no ice if you order a soda, cause they gip you with a cup full of ice (both places do). But all together, don't support a mediocre establishment like Geno's. Because let's face it they're only in business because of some misguided food rivalry that got started who-knows-how. And cause it's obvious that not only do they have no pride in food quality, they have little respect for their patrons (dude, those guys are pushy) or for an entire race of people with their totally ludicrous displays of asinine, ignorant, flat-out racist propaganda. Man! This place totally ruined my feel-good vibe for, like, a solid hour! That lasts longer than the heartburn! Geno's, I'm sorry to tell you, but you kinda suck big time in ˜the categories of deliciousness and, apparently, moral fiber. I award you no points."
7479,9,3,1,11/17/2011,"Everytime I watch TV, I always see Geno's or Pat's featured as the best cheesesteaks in Philly. ˜So naturally, when I went to visit, I wanted to go to Geno's or Pat's. ˜When we got there, I just picked one. I wanted to try both but, I knew I'd be stuffed like a turkey if I did. ˜So I just chose Geno's. ˜Yes it's a tourist trap, but from the long lines, it traps a lot of people like me. ˜Read the signs and make sure you order right, otherwise you'll get laughed at like me. ˜I tried to order Wiz and Provolone. ˜That's two cheeses. ˜oops. ˜The sandwich was greasy and the meat was tough. ˜Real tough. ˜I suspect they probably cook the meat in huge batches and leave it to the side to heat..and cook..and cook and cook..until it's tough as leather. ˜But hey, at least I got to try and I can say that I have! :)"
7480,9,2,1,11/14/2011,"Had just the standard Philly Cheesesteak wasn't impressed, it also made me a bit sour that they just had the sandwich sitting there at the window and slid it over to me. The meat wasn't very flavorful, and the cheese was meh.. too."
7481,9,2,1,11/14/2011,"Pat's vs Geno's?! Keep reading to find out! You let me down, Philly, you let me down. Got half of each. Was sooo excited because they were both on the travel channel (why? i have no idea) Hi miserable dude, i know you hate your job sorry. Your shirt matches the building so you should at least pretend like you don't hate taking my order (Luie CK reference). Like Pat's, the bread was un-toasted. I guess this is preferred by some people, not me. This is a glorified Subway sandwich but worse because you cant customize it. (love you Jarred). Not allot of meat, flat and sort of soggy. Who wins?!?!, Honestly, neither. They were both the same sandwich i swear both owners have some sort of collaboration with each other. If i had a gun to my head to pick one....Sorry mom and dad love you its been a good run. Both equally boring. I can throw together a better Philly in my kitchen with frozen minute steaks."
7482,9,1,1,11/14/2011,"When yelping about Geno's there are just so many directions that you can take this. One could rant on the awful racism that is plastered all over the establishment. Another direction could be the deplorable customer service they display even in some of their signage which directs you like you are a three year old. The easiest and most direct route is the fact that the establishment is nothing more than a glorified tourist trap that has made it's name and money on the backs of others claiming to be ""true Americans"". For this yelp I'll just focus on the food and leave the other stuff to those with more time on their hands ;) As many others who have been sucked into this tourist trap I had an expectation of having an excellent authentic Philly Cheesesteak. After all if you didn't grow up in Philly you assume you have only experienced mere imitations at your local sandwich shop or perhaps even frozen food section. Well after eating a cheesesteak from Geno's my first thought was, wow I think I'll stick to the frozen ones. The cheesesteak tasted a bit like a piece of cardboard you may have munched on when you were five (hey maybe that's why the signs are written that way) with some cheese and lots and lots of grease... Did I mention it was greasy. I was very disappointed but hey it was a $9 learning experience, but for that price I could have picked up two at Wawa and been more satisfied (no, Wawa does not have the best cheesesteaks for those reading this that are not from around here) Let's face it, no matter what we yelp people will go to Geno's just to say they went there, that's how they stay in business. Just a word to the wise, when you have choked down that greasy cheesesteak, don't bother trying another one, save the 9 bucks for Pat's across the street so you can say you tried them too. Then when your finished with Pat's go and find a real authentic Philly cheesesteak. :) If you are wondering where... Hey that's what your yelp is for :) Look up somewhere with good ratings from real Philadelphia residents. I can point you towards Tony Luke's but hey I'm a New Yorker who is transplanted to Delaware, so Im not up on the latest and greatest Philly has to offer."
7483,9,5,1,11/13/2011,"Perfection. Melts in your mouth. ˜Gotta get it with cheese wiz. If your not from the area, skip the sides and just get 2 sandwiches. You will never have another one like it!"
7484,9,3,1,11/8/2011,"I was up in Philly a bit for business and decided to do the touristy thing and try Pat's and Gino's. ˜Simply put, I had the cheesesteak wit' onions (they didn't have mushrooms like Pat's did, or at least I didn't see them). ˜It was fine. ˜Not great, not bad.. The meat here is sliced, not chopped like Pat's, which seems to make it a bit juicier. ˜I found it easier to eat it with the chopped meat. ˜Geno's I kind of had to tear through. The person I was working for has lived in Philly all his 73yrs and had never been to either one, and said there are plenty of cheesteak places and they pretty much all do it the same. Parking can be next to impossible. ˜A few blocks away is a shopping market. ˜Just park in the lot there and walk the 2-3 blocks."
7485,9,2,1,11/8/2011,If you are around this way and want a cheese steak just go to Pat's not they they are much better but they are by a little.
7486,9,3,1,11/7/2011,"Whether this old man was racist or not, that doesn't factor into my rating. I can take a joke (even though he wasn't joking). Anyway, what's up with the huge Mumia Abdul Jamal plaque?! That was a little uncomfortable; cause if I didn't know any better, I would have thought someone had got shot dead right where I was standing. Yikes... In the Pat's vs Geno's battle, I gotta go with Pat's. Geno's left me feeling like I just ate a greasy, constipated cow; which incidentally, left me feeling like a greasy constipated cow. Taste-wise, it wasn't bad. They can grill their onions a little more, though."
7487,9,4,1,11/7/2011,"i was down in philly recently over the weekend last week and well i went down to both geno and pats and i have to write a review for both of them. i am not a philadelphian so i really do not know what a good philly cheese steak taste like, all i know they are better than other states cheese steak who they all try to replicate it. one thing i like about phillies philly chease steak is that there are more meat than veggies which i did not expect that which that was awesome because i had ""fake"" philly cheese steak where i live in colorado and colorado have less meat and more veggies. but one thing is that i am not going to compare both places because 1. i do not know what is a good philly cheese steak taste like. 2. both pats and geno are good well not good but awesome! 3. for sure when i go back down there i will buy some more from both restaurant and bring them home as well. haha. overall if i have to pick 1 then just go to both of them because they are just across the street. if there is a line i will just wait even if it will be all day just to get both geno and pats because philly cheese steak are worth waiting for."
7488,9,3,1,11/7/2011,"If you're looking to find the best Cheesesteak in Philadelphia Geno's is absolutely NOT it. You'd be better off traveling to Belmont Ave or Front and Snyder. If your looking for a true Philly tourist attraction than Geno's is for you. Glowing Neon lights, celebrity pictures lining the walls, long lines packed with tourists, and a rule than can never be broken - Know what you're ordering before you get to the front of the line. There's also something fun about rolling to Genos at 4am after you get out of the club. Everybody in line is sloppy drunk and the cheesesteaks taste so much better than they actually are."
7489,9,4,1,11/5/2011,"I LOVE THEIR CHEESE FRIES!!!!! The thing between the two rivalry joints of Pats and Genos, is that this places does stand out more when you first look at the place. It has that very loud look and it does seem like there's so many things going on all at once. It's like a Las Vegas dumped joint to dine at. LOL. But if I were to visit Philadelphia again in the future, I will definitely won't be choosing side because I love both spots. They just have their own specific style of cooking and presenting their own philly cheesesteak. Geno's Steaks Philly Cheesesteak was delicious especially if you pair it with their Cheese Fries. The steak wasn't chopped the way I've seen philly cheesesteak but that doesn't mean it's good. Their meat was actually very tender, it was more like quality meat. Although, I'd want it to be very juicy and very fatty like. So, their cheesesteak really wasn't as good as Pats juicy and fatty Philly Cheesesteak. Though, there is one thing that I love about this place, it was their cheese fries. It's simple dish, fries + cheese whiz = ooey gooey fries *drool Gosh, reviewing these two philly cheesesteak makes me crave it even more. Too bad I have not found a good Philly Cheesesteak here in Los Angeles, CA. If anyone knows a place, please do recommend."
7490,9,3,1,11/5/2011,"In the 20 years of living in Philadelphia I always heard of the rivalry between Pat's and Geno's, but I never made the trek down to 9th to try out either one. Last night I finally made that trip and I have to say that the cheesesteak I got (whiz, wit-out) was pretty decent. Though, they lay down the meat in strips versus chopping it up (like every other cheesesteak place I've heard of). Im not saying that this fact makes it a bad cheesesteak, but it takes away from it just a touch for me. There is definitely way too much hype about either one establishment, but I find the back and forth fighting like an old married couple to be quite humorous. If you're sitting at Geno's then someone near you or the people you're with are talking about the steak you got compared to the ones at Pat's and visa versa. I don't agree with Vento's ""Speak english or GFTO"" mentality and that does sway me to across the street more...it is after all just a cheesesteak place. But hey, thats just me."
7491,9,5,1,11/3/2011,With out a doubt beats Pat's out the water!!!
7492,9,3,1,11/1/2011,"My first Philly cheese steak, I was a little underwhelmed. It was good, but I won't go out of my way for it again. The service with a frown I assume is a Philly thing."
7493,9,3,1,10/31/2011,"With the novelty of Pats vs. Geno's I felt compelled to give it a try Pros: -Relatively priced - $9 for a large cheese steak sandwich. -Bread is crunchy in a way that makes the sandwich enjoyable -Some of the workers are relatively friendly. Cons: - The atmosphere is aesthetically unpleasing - it looks like a vegas casino threw up all over a building. -The meat was rather dry -Yeah, the whole racist thing isn't relevant to the food but it still irks me. I'm a Pat's kind of girl - sorry!"
7494,9,1,1,10/27/2011,fuck this place...bad food and bad service. ˜ fuck the all the minimum wage workers that work there cuz they all got bad attitudes.
7495,9,1,1,10/25/2011,Very disappointing. Tasted like stake'um with cheese wiz. Anyone who can even cook just a little can make a better Philly at home. I just don't get all the hype. The owner was very rude. He has lost his passion if he ever had any
7496,9,3,1,10/19/2011,"Unfortunately, not the best cheesesteak I've had during my time in Philly (See my favorite at By George! in the Reading Terminal Market). But I'm a Pat (my bf is a Geno). I didn't quite enjoy the sliced pieces of beef and unnerved at how fast the sandwich came out. And even though my bf is Geno fan, he liked Pat's bread better. Our guide got us the fries with cheese whiz which my bf enjoyed thoroughly."
7497,9,2,1,10/19/2011,"Yes I've experienced better. I don't care about the lines. But the food is what I'm there for. Coming to Philadelphia I went to Geno's first and after eating the cheese steak. The meat didn't have flavor, so eating that thing was like eating cheese and bread. Second day for lunch I came back and wasn't going to try Pat's but I'm glad I did. You will too!"
7498,9,1,1,10/16/2011,"Unfortunately I ordered and paid for my cheesesteak before I noticed all the awful racist bumper stickers, photos... (take a look at my photo) The cheesesteak wasn't good at all. ˜I took a couple of bites and I threw it away. ˜I walked away with my head down in shame for supporting this place..."
7499,9,1,1,10/16/2011,"Seriously Philadelphia!! This is whats supposed to knock my socks off!! ˜Are you fuckin kidding me!! ˜All these years passed and Im finally gonna try an authentic Philly cheesesteak!! I was waiting for some 10 inch high, cheese and onions explosion of a hero, insane looking thing to arrive, instead I got this sorry miserable looking, steak umm tasteless thing with absolutely no weight to it, I thought he just gave me the bread wrapped up in wax paper, I had to open it in front of him to check. ˜Anyway, this was the worst fucking garbage I ever tasted in my life!! Coming from Brooklyn people, this was such a joke, Brooklyn represents their reputation, they should be called BROOKLYN CHEESESTEAKS because Brooklyn totally destroys them in cheesesteaks. ˜ ˜And not to mention the people that work there are total jerkoffs, I come from Brooklyn, I know how to play the role with who to be nice to and not, but when your running a business the secret is to be nice!! ˜People couldn't give a rats ass about my review because their gonna try it anyway but youll be sorry, Im so embarrassed that this is what Philly has to offer as their best."
7500,9,1,1,10/14/2011,"This place is totally living on reputation. ˜They're not friendly to say the least, but that doesn't even matter to me with cheesesteaks. ˜ The tourists all want to come here, ˜let them have it. ˜To the discerning individual, its just bad. ˜The steak is as mediocre as it gets. ˜It's typically super crowded. ˜This is not a sandwich crafted with care, it's just a slapped together waste of money. ˜It's only useful for a late night visit after a night of heavy drinking. ˜Even then, go to Wawa or something. ˜At least you can find SOMETHING decent there. ^^^This was my review of Pat's steaks across the street from Geno's. Take all the same stuff and just enhance the negative aspects that much more and you have my review of Geno's. ˜The staff is a little more condescending and weaselly. ˜The steak is a little crappier (less meat, equally flavorless). ˜It's as unsightly as a place an be. ˜Not a lot of good you can say about this place."
7501,9,4,1,10/9/2011,"I went a few weeks ago with some friends. The food was good. The service was very fast. I'm not a fan of the lack of seating & long lines, but overall a must for Philadelphians and tourists."
7502,9,5,1,10/9/2011,"This is as original and good as it gets as far as Philly cheese steaks go. I suggest a steak with onions on provolone. Don't get me wrong, they are a good portion, just don't expect to have the beef pilled on to the point where it's spilling out the hoagie roll. Speaking of the hoagie roll, it comes on a roll that is to die for. The sandwich is a perfect mix of fresh doe with the other flavors from the meat and onion mixing togeather. I also suggest putting about 4-5 hot peppers on the sandwich which they offer at a ""condiment bar"" after you pick up your sandwich. Pat's across the street doesn't offer that and which makes Gino's better. Other that that they're pretty much the same sandwich."
7503,9,3,1,10/4/2011,"Yep. I was a tourist in Philly so I went to Geno's. Its kind of like going to Memphis and taking a swing by Graceland. You may not like all the songs, but its something you HAVE to do. I got lucky on a Tuesday at lunch. There was no real line and it was a beautiful day to sit outside. I ordered the cheese steak with provolone and onions. The staff must have been bored because they were cheery and playful with me. Order sandwiches at the first window. I ordered french fries and a drink too. Order that other stuff at the other window. Oh, I said. He gave me that look like I was such a rookie. True, sir! True! So I go to the other window and the guy sees that I have a convention tag hanging from my neck and he says that the convention tour passed by yesterday and went to the wrong place. They went to Pat's across the street, which is where Philly cheese steaks began - but they are Geno's arch nemesis. I told him, yeah, we saved the best for last. He liked that. So about the food? they asked. Well, the bun was warm and the outside was crisp and the inside was soft. So far so good. The meat was sliced and slightly spiced, very tender. The sweet onions and the provolone were a nice compliment. I was surprised the sandwiches didn't have a lot more meat. I've been other places where the beef is falling out of the bun and the cheese is slathered all over it, great big globs of gooey, yummy grease. This was not that. But it was still tasty. I just expected more and messier. All in all, I'm glad I went. Yeah there was some of that ""freedom fry"" signage on the walls that I think is silly, but they also support the police, military and fire fighters. So that was cool to see all the ribbons and medals on the walls. They have some great photo's of celebrities eating there. Some of the pics are older than others though. I saw Jay Leno back when he actually had one chin instead of his current three. So check out Geno's or walk across the street to Pat's if you want a solid Philly cheese steak."
7504,9,2,1,10/4/2011,"There's so much to consider. On the one hand, it's become overrun as a serious tourist trap. But on the other, it holds a pretty plain stake to Philly history, going strong for 45 years, and helping to make the cheesesteak iconic for Philadelphia. But all they did was plop down across the street from the place that invented the cheesesteak years before Geno's owner Joey Vento was even born. And that whole thing with the ordering in English just made him look like a jerk (may he rest in peace). The food? It's okay. It's not a bad cheesesteak. But it's nowhere near as good as literally dozens of other places in the city. It costs $9, which is way too much by about $1.50, and the line stretches so far into the street that you actually have to consciously avoid the traffic. Save your time, your money and your appetite for a more worthy purveyor of this very special sandwich."
7505,9,2,1,9/30/2011,"Geno's steaks are average at best. ˜I usually stop by after the bars close. ˜ Pro's: ˜Its quick and not too expensive. ˜They support the Police, Fire & EMS services. Con's: ˜They don't have too much meat in the sandwich's and they are very plain tasting. There are many, ˜less famous places that offer way better cheese steaks."
7506,9,4,1,9/30/2011,"Geno's is the talk of the town or really...it's a place everyone mentions when you talk about philly cheese steaks...Do I think it's the best of the best...not quite, but it sure is at the top of my list! ˜I was a bit nervous when I first came to order because I'm from out of town and I didn't know how to order. ˜It was very intimidating and I wasn't really used to the straight up in your face service. . . I ordered something very simple. . .a plain cheesesteak with provolone and mushrooms..that's it..did it taste good? Sure it did! ˜But of course I had to make my way over to Pat's to do a side by side comparison and figure out which one tasted better. . .I think they're both great! ˜But I liked ordering at Pat's better."
7507,9,1,1,9/28/2011,"Average sandwich! I was definitely disappointed! We were PRESSED for a ""real"" Philly cheesesteak! I'll take a DC ""steak & cheese"" any day! Not to mention they were the RUDEST workers ever! Worse than NYC! They almost chopped my head off when I asked for shredded lettuce and yellow American cheese!! NEVER AGAIN!! And it was definitely NOT a $9 sandwich!!"
7508,9,5,1,9/28/2011,LOVE their cheese fries!!
7509,9,1,1,9/28/2011,Sandwich is boring and that's being nice. The decor is great if you're a racist or just plain hate those who may be different from you.
7510,9,2,1,9/28/2011,"Being from Philly and trying tons of different cheesesteaks from various places, I don't know why this place always has a long line. ˜I usually only come here when I have out of town guests who have never eaten a real Philly cheesesteak and only know about Genos and Pats. ˜ I usually go with the traditional, whiz-with (cheesewhiz and onions). ˜The meat has no flavor, but the bread is good. ˜For the price you pay, you get a pretty small sandwich. ˜I can pay half the price and get a cheesesteak from another place that is twice as big. ˜The fries are greasy and soggy. ˜ Overall, this place is over-rated."
7511,9,3,1,9/28/2011,"It's a Philly institution and subject to being massively over-hyped, but try to put most of that out of your mind, get in the enormous line, enjoy the photos and police/fire dept badge displays, and settle in for a tasty sandwich I'm a non-traditionalist when it comes to cheesesteaks. ˜I'm all about the provolone with triple onions. ˜If you are ordering this at the counter, you'll say, ""provolone, wit, extra, extra onions."" ˜Then I like to put a nice fat ribbon of ketchup down the center. ˜In my personal opinion, this is the best way to dress a cheesesteak. ˜You've got the slightly fatty, savory meat, the sweet onions, the salty sweet kick of ketchup, the creamy cheese and the bread to wrap everything up. At Geno's this approach is pretty tasty. ˜It's not the best cheesesteak I've ever had, but it's definitely a satisfying sandwich, and ultimately, that's exactly what I was looking for. Geno's is very efficient in cranking out the steaks with a good amount of seating, a long stand and eat counter and plenty of napkins and condiments. PARTING THOUGHT: Is it worth standing in line for...hmm, maybe not for locals, but if you're in town to visit, it's not a bad way to pass the line on a sunny day after strolling through the Italian market. ˜If you brought the numbers, you can even send half your crew to Pat's across the way and have your own sandwich showdown!"
7512,9,2,1,9/28/2011,"I love the history of the rivalry between Pat's and Geno's. ˜I was super excited to have some extra time in Philly to experience the famous philly cheese taste challenge. ˜Let me preface by saying that I realize that these are probably not the best examples of philly cheesesteak in the city, but it's still a tradition. ˜ We ordered one with wiz and one with provolone from both Pat's and Geno's. ˜Both were good, but Pat's was the clear winner in the battle. ˜Geno's meat was dry and lacking. ˜The question is answered, in my mind at least; Pat's wins!"
7513,9,1,1,9/23/2011,"After being disappointed by my steak at Pat's, I had to go across the street to check it's competition Gino's. I could not have been more disappointed. The steak wit with provolone was skimpy and flavorless. ˜I mean there were like four pieces of meat on the sandwich for 9 bucks. The fries were undercooked bleeh. At some point they must have started believing all the hype and stopped trying."
7514,9,4,1,9/19/2011,"OK... I really don't see how people can seriously say Pat's is better than Geno's!! HUH?! Geno's is definitely KING in these parts! Since Geno's doesnt chop up their meat, it seals in the juices (fat)! You want a fatty cheese steak for that makes is so flavorful. Also, that dirty water of Philly makes for great bread!! I must say I was extremely happy that I was able to get a Geno's cheese steak at 2am while hurricane Irene was blowing away!!! When you get that craving, nothing will stop you!!"
7515,9,1,1,9/19/2011,Wow did they really pull beef from a cow's ass or what! Tasted like crap. What is up with all the hype? Tasteless and low quality of all food. Ur local steak and cheese is a lot better than driving all the way to Philly. The worst is the unfriendly service with the altitude tones. TheY rush you even when no one is in line. This place need a reality check of modern day business concept. People only believe its good bc of the hype.
7516,9,2,1,9/19/2011,"I give Geno's two stars but I gave Pat's two as well even though Pat's is better. If you read my review of Pat's you'll know why. Both these places are just ok. Both of their steaks are flavorless but Geno's is drier than Pat's. I was disappointed. I thought Italians were all about flavor but these two Steak giants serve flavorless meat. Let me suggest a shot of butter and some garlic, and other Italian spices to bring some flavor to the party. I bet I can make a Cheesesteak that tastes 10 times better than either one of these places. Hype for sure."
7517,9,4,1,9/19/2011,"I heard through my bf about the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's and I was so excited to try them both! The ambiance of each is completely different. ˜Geno's is bright, the Las Vegas of Cheese Steak establishments if you will. ˜It was clean and the staff was friendly. I preferred Geno's Cheese Steak to Pat's. ˜I know that Pat's is supposed to be the original but I liked Geno's MUCH better! ˜It's def. worth getting a sandwich from both establishments and deciding for yourself!!!"
7518,9,4,1,9/18/2011,"Line is long but moves fast. ˜Good steaks deserving 4 stats, but we prefer Pat's."
7519,9,3,1,9/18/2011,"i don't eat red meat, so i'm judging the fries - the cheese fries are quite tasty - and that hot sauce is no joke (like a few of these other reviews say). it is absolutely burn your mouth up spicy...they need a sign/warning but it was quite good!"
7520,9,2,1,9/17/2011,"I went on a cross country roadtrip from San Diego, CA to Boston, MA. Along the way, we stopped in Philadelphia to eat some cheesesteaks since they're known for it. We tried Genos first and ordered a cheesesteak with wiz and fries. I went halfsies with one of my friends because I needed to save room for Pat's across the street. When I bit into it, it wasn't omg good droolz omnom. =( It was just ok. I found it a bit bland and there wasn't that much meat. For $9, they could pile a bit more. I feel bad for giving a famous tourist trap 2 stars, but I seriously feel like I've had a lot better cheesesteaks elsewhere. =/"
7521,9,5,1,9/15/2011,"R.I.P. Joey By far my favorite and always my go to steak spot. The combination of the grease, big pieces of steak and the soft roll just cant be beat. Nothing, and I mean nothing beats a Geno's after drinking all night. I always opt for the American cheese too, no whiz. The American gives it that extra flavor that whiz just cant deliver. You need to laugh off the people that say Pats and Geno's are for ""tourists"". Pats and Geno's are the gold standard in the city. Everyone wants to make it sound like THEY have the go to spot just so they feel better about themselves. Comparing Pats/Geno's to places like Tony Luke's and Jim's is like comparing Coke and Pepsi. Yeah, both taste good but we all know Coke is the pioneer and undisputed champ that started it all - as are Geno's and Pats. Location; If you think Geno's is in the ""ghetto"", then you've never ACTUALLY been to a REAL ghetto. Hit me up sometime, we'll go for a ride. I'll miss Joey Vento. Its so rare to see and meet people that speak their mind these days given everyone in the world is SO sensitive about EVERY thing. I laughed (and usually agreed) at every time he caused a ""stir"" in the media. I'm blunt myself so I respect it. Geno's will always be my number one. Bottom line; You may have hated Joey, but you know you love his cheesesteaks."
7522,9,4,1,9/14/2011,I don't think I've ever eaten as fast as I did here. ˜Got the philly cheese steak with American cheese& onions. ˜A few minutes after ordering the line was super long. ˜The only bad thing is limited seating and gaudy lights.
7523,9,5,1,9/5/2011,I have to give Geno's a slight edge over Pats. We did the taste test and Geno's roll was fresher and they serve Coke products.
7524,9,5,1,9/5/2011,Sandwich was very good!! Didn't like it as much with provolone cheese versus the cheese whiz. I'd prefer extra cheese though. The bread was very good also. Soft but still firm enough to hold the juice from the meat.
7525,9,1,1,9/3/2011,"Friends recommended this place and I was looking forward to tasting some real philly cheese steak. When I took my first bite the steak was dry and it had no flavor. Also there's no restroom and no one was there to clear and wipe down the tables. On their menu they still have ""freedom"" fries instead of french fries. Come on!"
7526,9,2,1,9/2/2011,"I live not far from Philly but had never had an official Philly cheesesteak, so I was expecting a lot from Geno's. First off it's an eyesore, with neon lights everywhere. The staff is very quick and efficient. The cheesesteaks are unique in the fact that the steak isn't shredded and is in thin slices, and the bread is toasted and not the typical rolls. But I wasn't impressed otherwise. Cheesesteaks all taste the same to me."
7527,9,5,1,9/2/2011,"A Philadelphia tradition, Geno's Cheese Steak Sandwich. The Fresh Roll, Grilled Steak, Peppers & Onions. Eating on the street adds to the experience too. Pat's Cheese Steaks just across the street, must have both, careful choosing one over the other as your favorite, this could drive a wedge between your relationships."
7528,9,4,1,8/31/2011,Wiz with. Need I say more?
7529,9,3,1,8/31/2011,"I give Geno's 3 stars based on very select criteria... 1) I'd just eaten at Pat's, and by that comparison, Geno's was better. ˜(Better bread, thicker steak, and I went with provolone over whiz - a wise choice.) 2) Geno's is sort of a weird police officer shrine/anti-immigrant billboard. ˜I can't say I agree with their politics, but it's nice to stand for something, I guess. ˜It's rare to find such outright hatred and blind pride in 2011. ˜So, you know, novelty factor. 3) I ordered a birch beer to wash everything down. ˜We don't have that in Chicago, so I was delighted to taste a delicious new soda. If you have a mind to visit Geno's intentionally, don't expect much out of the food, expect to be bombarded with vague racism and order a birch beer. Your stomach will hate you in the morning, but I think that might be the point."
7530,9,3,1,8/30/2011,"Stuck in Philly for a night. First agenda was try a philly cheese sandwich. I've heard of Geno's from travel channel and since that was the only one that popped up on yelp we decided to check it out. Since it was my first philly cheese sandwich in Philly I had nothing to compared to. The sandwich and fries were good. Had to try the cheese wiz and I was a fan. It was a pricey meal though. Next day, walked around downtown and came upon Lou's Philly Cheese Steaks. This beats Geno's! Lou was such a charmer and the food was delicious. Super cheap and super filling!"
7531,9,3,1,8/30/2011,"Wiz wit is the way to go. ˜From KC, I choose Geno's over Pat's. ˜We went to Geno's twice while on our vacation to Philly. ˜And, we skipped Pat's the second time around..."
7532,9,1,1,8/30/2011,"This is the most disgusting food in Philly, period. I don't care whether it's a novelty food and if there's history in this restaurant, just go online and look at pictures instead because if you eat here you will want to puke. There are so many better cheesesteaks in Philly that actually taste great and weren't made by the underbelly of everything that defines the ghetto. I get that tourists want to feel authentic by going here, but seriously, you'd be safer going and spending a night in a penitentiary. The ingredients here are dry, disgusting, extremely cheap pieces of what is most likely shoe rubber. Sadly, this is nothing more than a place where dirt-poor people come to eat when they need some meat in their diet. The exact same review goes for Pat's. Ask yourself- do you ever go to your local soup kitchen just for authenticity's sake? Avoid both of these places like the plague."
7533,9,3,1,8/30/2011,"Essentially the same review as Pat's for me.. I find both Pat & Geno's highly overrated but I do suggest going at least once fir novelty's sake. ˜ Take a ˜friend and order the same items at Geno;s & Pats, Share to compare! ˜ ˜ These guys have gotten too commercialized.. and too much attitude. I prefer the shops with more mom and pop/hole in the wall feel. It seems like their are many less hyped but higher quality spots all over the city.. AND lots of places with vegetarian friendly options! My review is mostly based on going repeatedly with friends... and their reactions. But I have tried their cheese fries.. ultra processed cheese so you definitely need a fork to eat these babies.. so synthetic and bad.. but ooo so good all at the same time. I'm lucky I don't live in Philly.. they are like crack (not just at Pats but the cheese fries in general)"
7534,9,3,1,8/29/2011,thicker meat...dry...disappointed.. cheaper than pats though... something beer..which is root beer...i forgot what its called is good
7535,9,1,1,8/29/2011,Rude cashier and a $9 meh sandwich. Man v Food you have failed me. If I make it back to Philly I'll try Pat's.
7536,9,2,1,8/27/2011,So we headed down here and my wife and daughter went and ordered Geno's and I ordered Pat's since this was their first time eating Philly Cheese steak sandwich I told them they had to try both. In the end Geno's was not as good. ˜The meat was dry and not as good and bread was a bit to chewy for my taste.
7537,9,3,1,8/27/2011,"Let me start by saying I really don't eat cheesesteak. ˜Based on direction from locals and previous patrons, I decided to go to Geno's. ˜I had provolone and onions and it was quite good. ˜However, it was so greasy that I almost couldn't get my mind off of that fact. ˜It's a must visit place on your tour of Philadelphia, but if you're not into fast food, don't expect much."
7538,9,3,1,8/26/2011,Not as good at Pat's. The diffrence is Pat's caramelizes the onions and Geno's was almost raw. ˜Both places were rude in trying to order.
7539,9,4,1,8/25/2011,We added a trip to Gino's after seeing it featured on Man vs. Food and we were so glad we did. We drove all the way from Boston to take part in the duel with Pat's Steaks across the way. Best looking Steak n Cheese I have ever had. Sad to say that Gino passed away 5 days after we made our trek. I'm glad I was able to make the trip and meet Gino. RIP Gino
7540,9,3,1,8/24/2011,RIP Joey Vento!
7541,9,3,1,8/24/2011,"This place is BOMB !!! ˜ ˜Makes you feel good eating here. ˜They even have a sign that says ""Order in English"". ˜You can go across the street to Pat's but your not a fairy right? RIGHT ?"
7542,9,3,1,8/23/2011,"I saw Geno's on the travel channel 10+ years ago and have always wanted to try their cheesesteaks. ˜The have a rivalry with Pat's cheesesteak across the street so you really have to try both and compare who's better. ˜I finally had the opportunity to visit the east coast recently and knew I had to make the pilgrimage and mark it off my bucket list. ˜All in all, the cheese steak wasn't bad. ˜I got the standard cheesesteak WIT whiz and onions for $9. ˜The bread was really gourmet and the shaved rib-eye meat was fresh. ˜The sandwich was a bit bland and could have used some salt and pepper but wasn't bad. ˜There were hoards of tourists just like me waiting in line intimidated by the mean muggin clerk at the window. ˜I remembered on the show that they would throw you out of the line if you didn't order correctly. ˜So here's a tip, practice your order ahead of time and don't give them any eye contact. ˜The first window is for cheesesteak ordering only. ˜You pay and MOVE ON to the second window for drinks. ˜Mess this up and you're at the end of the line."
7543,9,4,1,8/23/2011,"Too close to call. Geno's and that other place are both very good and worth the trip. Got two ""wit"" and wiz. Very good."
7544,9,2,1,8/23/2011,I went here on my last trip to philly... It was pretty decent couldn't complain but I think Pat's tasted a little better. It's not as crowded as Pat's but it is cleaner for sure. All in all it was a cheesesteak but Jims is way better...
7545,9,5,1,8/22/2011,Better than Pat's!!!!
7546,9,1,1,8/22/2011,"Geno, you are not american. ˜ I'm probably not the first to say this nor will I be the last. ˜ Your steaks are good, but I will not go back due to your preference to be a jerk to non-locals. ˜ AND - your bike shop sucks...."
7547,9,1,1,8/22/2011,"HORRIBLE. ˜I had a couple of great cheesesteaks in Philly, a lot in all, (Dalessandro's was #1) and Geno's was absolutely terrible. ˜I can not understand why tv gives this place any recognition at all, Pat's blows it away, and even it is fair at best. ˜The steak slices are solid, not chopped, I found them very plain and dry. ˜I actually could not finish the sandwich. As others have mentioned, the propaganda is just immature and silly. ˜I ordered form the owner and told him i want onions and cheese. ˜We saide ""You mean wit and whiz?"" ˜I said I was only following his ""This is America, WE SPEAK ENGLISH ONLY!"" policy, lol."
7548,9,1,1,8/22/2011,"gotta agree with a lot of the folks on here: this place just makes me uncomfortable. ˜all the anti-immigration, pro-philly police propaganda was unnerving. ˜ the food's terrible as well. ˜the steaks are sloppy and undercooked and the roast pork is pretty much flavorless. ˜ you could certainly do worse than this place but i would never recommend it."
7549,9,1,1,8/20/2011,"They are racist and the low key Pat's across the street is better anyway. However there are better tasting ˜cheese steaks to be found all over Philly. Don't give this xenophobe your business, especially when its better and more for the money right across the street. Basically, trying a steak at virtually any mom and pop shop is better than what Ive tried from here. Don't believe the travel channel, its an overpriced tourist trap. Every time I've ever been to this intersection, Pats is busier than Geno's. But if you really want a decent steak, go to pats, or do yourself a greater favor and strike both off of your list. Steaks aren't mind blowing things anyway!"
7550,9,1,1,8/18/2011,"1) You can get Philly cheesesteaks anywhere just as good as in Philadelphia. ˜There's not much too it. 2) Compared to Tony Luke's, Steve's, etc., this one is particularly mediocre. 3) Had I noticed the blatantly racist propaganda prior to paying, I never would've ordered. ˜Is there anything more pathetic and ironic than an old ITALIAN guy putting up anti-immigration propaganda? ˜I also enjoyed the posted story about the 'mixed race' dog applying for welfare. ˜It's also an insult to the multicultural street their space is at the end of. ˜I assure you, this didn't affect my rating of their mediocre sandwich - that speaks for itself. 4) Do NOT get a roast pork sandwich - it is flavorless - no doubt because some dirty Mexican probably made it after taking my job, my wife, and that kickass job picking blueberries for $3/hour that I was really holding out for. ˜(note: the one w/ broccoli rabe at Tony Luke's is great)"
7551,9,4,1,8/18/2011,"Very good, just pricey for what you're getting."
7552,9,2,1,8/16/2011,"The service here was nice and quick. I came on a weekday so I barely had to wait long. The sandwiches and the cheese fries have to be ordered at separate windows. I did notice the cheese fries line being longer than the sandwich line. Overall, the sandwich was okay (nothing special) and pricey for what you are getting. I did find the meat tougher to chew because it comes in larger slices. It also lacked salt and moisture."
7553,9,3,1,8/15/2011,"Do not pay too much expectation, it's just cheese steak.... I went to Philly this weekend. It seems that all tourists in Philly will go to Geno's, so I did the same. I ordered the cheese steak sub. Hmmm....there were onion, cheese and steak in it, taste good, at least not bad....But it is just a sub... nothing special. ˜ I took a photo in front of the Geno's...at least I fulfill a mission of being a tourist...."
7554,9,2,1,8/15/2011,Racist bastard..
7555,9,2,1,8/14/2011,The steak here was skinny flanks that was bland in flavor. Try Pat's King of steaks instead.
7556,9,3,1,8/14/2011,"We came here right after Tony Luke's because we want to compare different cheese steak. Subs here were more juicy and their cheese was not solid, it was more like liquid. I think their cheese smell was better but the bread was worse. Not like Tony Luke's I felt they already cooked the beef and bread and put there waiting for the order. If you like stronger flavor (cheese and onions), this is the place for you."
7557,9,1,1,8/14/2011,Terrible service. Terrible cheesesteak. #Terrible
7558,9,1,1,8/13/2011,"My brother and I decided to head over here for lunch. While walking there, I saw a bunch of celeb photos and signatures and stuff on the wall so I figured this place must be pretty good, however, I was in for a huge letdown. I seriously could have gotten a better Philly cheesesteak from Carl's Jr. The bread felt like I was eating cardboard. The meat was really dry. It was overpriced and expensive, and I was really scared to order since we're not white and they are known to be racists. Also, my brother's cheesesteak had A HAIR in it. He was eating his 2nd or 3rd bite when he noticed some white thing sticking out. He pulled on it and out came about a two inch piece of white hair. It was disgusting and we had to throw away the whole thing. That was a nice 8 dollars in the trash. So all in all, this place should be avoided at all costs. Those who say that this place is delicious and good are dumbasses. The real secret to finding a truly delicious Philly cheesesteak is you have to go to the ghetto places!"
7559,9,1,1,8/11/2011,"nothing special, my mom ordered from Pats which took about an hour and i ordered from Genos, nothing special between the two, the reviews are very misleading for both restaurants, nothing special with Philly Cheesesteak, i would rather have my NY cheesesteak which is loaded with meet and cheese both Pats and Genos were real oily, low in cheese and low in meet, maybe i just had a bad sandwich you say? i ordered 8 for four people, they were consistent with all 8, real disappointed"
7560,9,3,1,8/10/2011,"Long wait and pricey cheese steak. Not worth the wait or money. The building itself is really flashy and I feel like they're trying to overcompensate what they lack in their food. The only thing I liked about the cheese steak was that they served it with a lot of fresh onions but otherwise, it was pretty greasy and bland. It was enough to make my tummy happy but I'll probably go somewhere else if I come back to Philly for a cheese steak next time."
7561,9,2,1,8/10/2011,the line is way to long for this place. i tried genos and went right across the street to try pats to decide which was better and i think pats is!
7562,9,1,1,8/9/2011,"Very disappointed. Stopped by Phila on the way to AC shouldnt have wasted gas. The bun was cold, meat was very average at best. I was expecting much more but I guess it more of a tourist trap."
7563,9,3,1,8/9/2011,"Racist, flashy, but food was alright. They don't have mushrooms like Pat's, but there was a lot more cheese which made it taste good. The bread at Pat's is better"
7564,9,5,1,8/8/2011,I liked it better than Pat's. Bigger and better.
7565,9,2,1,8/8/2011,"Having never had a cheesesteak at Pat's or Geno's, my husband and I randomly chose Geno's over Pat's (yes, we're from out of town). We got there around 4pm on a Saturday before going to see a Phillies game and waited in the line, which wrapped around the building, for probably about 20 minutes or so, which wasn't that bad. When we were the next to be served, we heard someone from another window say something along the lines of ""Can I help the next person?"" so, thinking he was talking to us since we were next in line, we took one or two steps to the left (out of the original line) and toward that other window and then realized that the other windows were for drinks or sides only. So we stepped BACK to our original spot, and the older man taking orders said to us, ""Line starts back there,"" motioning to where we got in line 20 minutes before. We proceeded to explain that we WERE in line, even asked the guy in line behind us to vouch for us, and he laughed it off and said ""I don't know, I don't know..."" Long story short, the man taking orders was RUDE, accusatory, and embarrassed us. He did eventually take our order, but not before making a scene. I understand that this is Philly and all that, but customers are customers and should not be made to feel insulted. Other than the rude service, the sandwiches were okay. My husband and I each got a sandwich and a drink and we paid around $25. If I could do it over, I'd just save my time and money and get food at the stadium. Needless to say, we won't be back."
7566,9,2,1,7/30/2011,"We made a special detour to Geno's based on it's online reputation...and what a disappointment! ˜You know something's up when the person who greets you at the window is rude with a negative attitude! ˜ But, we overlooked that, afterall...that guy may just be having a bad day. But then the sandwich was passed to us. ˜The steak was DRY, and tasted like a flavorless roast beef sandwich. ˜There was nothing on the sandwich expect cheese melted into the bread (i.e. so you can barely taste it, and the meat remained dry), and a few onions. ˜We had to add tons of relish, ketchup and mustard just to choke down this dry sandwich. ˜ What a disappointment! ˜ Genos is a place that is riding on the coat-tails of a past good reputation (probably when there was less competition, or when their was less arrogance and better service/food being served!) ˜Total waste of time...and wish we would have gone across the street to the other cheese steak place instead!"
7567,9,3,1,7/26/2011,I got both Geno's and Pat's for my first experience of cheesesteak. Don't let the long liens fool you beause service is quite fast and it's funny how the lines are divided up into sandwich and fries/soda. I thought that the sandwiches at Geno's were not as flavorful as Pat's. I tried the pork with whiz and it was a little bit too gooey for me. The whiz is not as good of a blend with pork as it is with beef. But the fries here are really good and I think it's worth the $4-5. Absolutely crunchy and flavorful.
7568,9,1,1,7/26/2011,"The cheesesteak was gross; the bright lights were annoying; and the ""decor"" was blatantly xenophobic."
7569,9,1,1,7/24/2011,Ugh
7570,9,3,1,7/21/2011,I ordered my first authentic Philly cheesesteak here and it failed my expectations. They keep it real simple: choice of cheese and steak (onions were optional). I wish they offered more items in the sandwich instead of the hot dog condiments on the side. Seating is available but make sure you be on the lookout because it gets filled up fast.
7571,9,5,1,7/19/2011,"In my opinions, Geno's is better than Pat's. When I visited, I bought cheese steaks from both establishments and ate both. ˜Yeah, I'm a gluttonous foodie. Genos: strips of meat instead of cut up meat, but they spread the cheese wiz throughout the sandwich making it more ""wet"" which I preferred. Pat's: Cut up pieces of meat with, but there is only a small amount of cheese whiz on top making the rest of the sandwich dry. However, the onions were pretty good for Pat's. If I ever get a chance to stop by Philly, I'll order both sandwiches again ad see if my opinions change."
7572,9,5,1,7/17/2011,Great fresh Bread from local bakery And super moist and tasty Love it
7573,9,1,1,7/16/2011,Toooooo much hype. ˜the food has no flavor.
7574,9,5,1,7/15/2011,"OMGAWD I LOVE GENO'S! THIS PLACE HAS ONE OF THE BEST PHILLY CHEESE STEAKS I HAVE EVER TRIED! I come here all the time with my BF whenever I come up to PA. love just getting the regular cheese steak with the whizz cheese and onions. It has more flavor in the sub with the whizz cheese. I've tried it with provolone once, but it wasn't AS great. It doesn't even take long to make, so right after you pay for it they have it ready for you. But I think the sub is a bit over priced. It is $9 just for one. But the cheese and onion does NOT cost extra. The sub itself is so juicy. I love the juiciness of the sub! The bread they use is pretty good. I'm not sure what they use, but it seems like it's a mix of sour dough and french bread. The meat is not just some thin layer as they have at Pat's cheese steak. The meat is a LOT better at Geno's. Please do not use there hot sauce. It is REALLY hot and over powering. So than you won't get a good taste of the sub. There cherry peppers are amazing too. It can be a bit over powering to those that can not take things that are spicy. I really do not recommend putting anything on the sub itself other than how it comes. DO NOT GET THERE CHEESE FRIES! I have to say that I was REALLY disappointed. It was really salty. The cheese they use is the whizz cheese. The fries seem similar to Wendy's friends. It is soggy. The fries do NOT come with the sub, nor does the drink. A drink is about $4? So to anyone that goes here I recommend you bringing your own drink! They don't even give free refills for an over priced drink. I REALLY RECOMMEND GENO'S OVER PAT'S ANY DAY!! THIS PLACE IS OPEN 24/7!"
7575,9,3,1,7/15/2011,The decor was super cheesy! ˜I've never seen Jersey Shore but I assume that this guy is one of their parents.
7576,9,1,1,7/14/2011,"Dry dry dry dry dry meat. Yet Oily somehow. ˜I don't know how that combination is possible, but Geno's somehow has done it. ˜ Since Geno's is famous and tourists flock to the area, ˜I'd suggest eating at Pat's, which is right across the street. ˜Pat's is at least edible and isn't as oily. ˜ Oh yeah, and it helps that Pat's Cheesesteaks isn't xenophobic or racist..."
7577,9,5,1,7/12/2011,"I love this place. ˜It is in a grimy part of the city, lit like a Christmas Tree on crack, and makes one thing. DAMN FINE CHEESESTEAKS. I love the fact that service is quick and gruff, and if you don't know what you want, you're hurried along. There are two great steak places in one part of town, and Geno's wins... hands down. ˜The meat is juicy, the onions are perfectly carmelized, and the choices of cheese are awesome. Make sure you know your terminology when you get to the ordering station and BRING CASH. The following statements are for people who don't know and/or are not from Philly. ""Wit"" = WITH carmelized onions ""Witout"" = WITHOUT carmelized onions 1) Whiz wit/witout = Cheese Whiz (yes, THAT processed cheese food) on your steak. ˜The original, and my favorite. ˜Tangy, tasty, and juicy. ˜Have a lot of napkins to eat this. 2) American wit/witout = American Cheese on your steak. ˜My wife's favorite. ˜They use thick sliced REAL white american cheese, a milder cheese for those who don't like sharp cheeses. 3) Prov (or Provie) wit/witout = Sharp Provolone cheese on your steak. ˜I love a good EXTRA SHARP cheese, and Geno's uses a great on on this steak. ˜Go for this one if you want zing without processed cheese food."
7578,9,5,1,7/11/2011,"Geno's, I miss you so much and I think about you all the time. Like many thousands of people before me, I visited Phili and did the obligatory side-by-side comparison with Pat's. To me, there was no contest. Geno's wins without a doubt."
7579,9,3,1,7/10/2011,It's Geno's it is not cheap it is not a huge cheesesteak it is Geno's. Take it or leave it this is the center of the Philly Cheeseteak Scene. As far as all of the political stuff goes to write a bad review based on that is silly. I'm sorry but if you don't like what a business owner thinks don't give him your business it is as easy as that. Personally I like Geno's more than Pat's for the sheer fact that Pat's always looks dirty to me while Geno's always looks spotless. Also everyone going there from out of town NO CREDIT CARDS AND NO BATHROOM so stop getting to the window and wasting everyones time by asking.
7580,9,4,1,7/7/2011,"I finally made it to Philadelphia! ˜Yay! My wife, sister, and-brother-in-law decided to take a road trip to Philly to see the historic sites, experience the culture, and of course, taste the delicious Philly Cheesesteaks! We went to Geno's to try theirs first. ˜Then we went to the one across the street. ˜I have to say, Geno's was our favorite! We ordered two Cheesesteaks with onions, mushrooms, and provolone. ˜The bread was chewy and delicious and the overall sandwich was everything I expected - delicious! It was fun to see how close in proximity these two shops are: directly across the street from one another. ˜The rivalry is very apparent. ˜Geno's is a little bigger and more flashy than Pat's, but both serve up a mean Cheesesteak sammich. If you're in Philly, why go anywhere else for Cheesesteak? Totally recommend!"
7581,9,2,1,7/6/2011,"We took a quick day trip to Philly last week with the main goal being to try the Cheesesteaks. ˜ ˜Nope, I didn't give a shit about the Liberty Bell nor did I have any desire to get tickets, wait 3 hours and finally visit the Liberty Center where I can see in real life what I hated reading about back in High School US History. ˜ ˜My goal being in Philly was the food. My wife and I decided to go to Pat's & Geno's and do a side by side comparison. ˜ We started out at Geno's and, quite frankly, I've had better Cheesteaks at home and certainly at Theo's back in San Francisco. ˜ What's with the rivalry and/or hoopla. ˜ Geno's Cheesteak sucks, plain and simple. Don't waste your time here and walk across the street for a really good cheesesteak!"
7582,9,2,1,7/4/2011,"There're really isn't much else I can add to the feedback already given by the 700 more reviews already here on Yelp, but this place was really disappointing. All I can say is that if you're going there despite the reviews, then lower your expectations, then you might enjoy the food a bit more. I think you could tell from the line that Geno's isn't the popular one, since their line was much shorter than Pat's across the street. One really great thing about Geno's? They're really quick to fulfill your order."
7583,9,3,1,7/4/2011,"We hurried across the street to Geno's, hearts pounding. ˜Could it usurp the delectable Pat's for my cheesesteak affections? ˜Thankfully, the answer is no. ˜Geno's seemed much more stylized. ˜Tons of pictures of police and ""patriotic"" sayings that were pretty off-putting. ˜The sandwich was served very quickly. . .but it ˜was dry! ˜Also, it was harder to find a seat. ˜Not as soft and cheesy as Pat's, but still a Philly institution."
7584,9,3,1,7/2/2011,"Is there a magic Genie I don't know about at Geno's? Poor Geno's. I had high expectations since this was on the food channel. Geno's looks iconic from the outside, but unfortunately it feels like a scam after you eat there. I had a lot of problems with with the food at Geno's. The steak had these fatty things on them that reminded me of caviar. Also Geno's uses slabs of meat and it kinda reminds me of high school cafeteria food. On top of that, they had canned mushrooms, and they stand out in a gross way. I love mushrooms but these slimy things are a big let down at all Genos, Pats, and Jim's in Philly, Pat's used the least which was smart. Also the tables were just gross. I understand they're busy but not only could I not enjoy my food because I couldn't find a place to sit (except for the ""leaning"" old fashion ledge type area) when I did find a seat It was so gross I could barely eat. There were cheese stains everywhere...and with no plates and a messy hoagie i felt like I was melting in to the nasty table as I ate. I was probably too nice with my 3 star review. There were things that were nice like feeling like I was at an old fasion, authentic, Philly cheese steak joint, and I love those red peppers (both Pat and Geno's have them) . But those too things don't make up for it. There were some things that bothered me that I even left out of this review to be nice!"
7585,9,2,1,6/29/2011,"Came to Philadelphia to mainly try out their Philly Cheesesteaks, and after grabbing a bite at Pat's, we just had to go across the street to compare it with Geno's! Geno's steaks are sliced instead of chopped. You know what? I hate to say this, but when comparing to Pat's, Pat's definitely win this challenge. It might be just preference, but I find the steak at Geno's to be somewhat bland. :( Their service is so fast, it's like, BAM BAM BOOM! If you order slow, or pay slow, feels like you're going to get yelled at! HAHA."
7586,9,1,1,6/29/2011,This place sucked .. Don't believe the hype... I tried both and pats is way better then Geno's .but I will never come from ny for either again. I make better at home . What a let down
7587,9,2,1,6/27/2011,Highly overpriced and overrated. Pat's has a better cheesesteak even though they are overrated as well! I also heard this place is racist.
7588,9,5,1,6/27/2011,I might just be a tourist that doesn't know any better but Geno's tasted damn good to me. ˜I got the wit whiz and it was way better than any other place in the US I've been. ˜There hot sauce was surprising a lot hotter than I thought so I had to brush it off to not ruin my yummy cheese steak. ˜ I've heard that some locals hate this place due to political reasons and health consciousness. ˜With this in my mind I still had a good time and delicious meal. ˜A must try if you are visiting Philly.
7589,9,1,1,6/25/2011,"Go to Pats across the street. This guy is nothing but a fraud. How do you have a big sign saying you support the troops out front but not give a active military discount??? The best way to support a group is doing it anonymously anyway, not by making a few donations to milk big bucks out of the public because you put up signs saying you care."
7590,9,1,1,6/23/2011,"I live 1 block from genos, and I have only been there once, even when Im drunk and starvin I will never go back. It is the most tasteless food I have ever had."
7591,9,4,1,6/21/2011,Great cheesesteaks nomnomnom
7592,9,5,1,6/21/2011,"All time best cheesesteaks. ""wiz wit."" Sorry Pats fans. I'm all about the cheese on the bottom of my steak for whatever reason. Ah, the college memories of standing in this line at 2 am. I'm getting hungry just reminiscing about it."
7593,9,1,1,6/20/2011,"Stay away! I would give this place negative stars if I could. ˜First, the cheese steak: the beef was dry and tough, the onions were raw (rather than sauteed as they should've been), there were no peppers (not to mention mushrooms), and it was served with cheese wiz, rather than, um, actual cheese. ˜ Second, the price: $9 for a bad sandwich following a notable wait in line is a scam. Third, and perhaps most importantly, the staff and environment of the place: Geno's is arguably xenophobic, with signs like, ""This is America, speak English!"" Never mind that we don't have a national language and that the founder of Geno's was Italian and so presumably spoke, uh, Italian. ˜There was also a shrine-like photo to a cop who had been killed 30 years ago, which struck me as, well, odd and perhaps obsessive? ˜Then there were the in your face photos of Geno with Glenn Beck, Geno with Rush Limbaugh and, oh look, Geno with Sean Hannity! Then of course there were the token pictures of scantily clad teenagers (females, of course). ˜Overall it was really (white) trashy decor. ˜The staff aren't worth much commentary - they were generally trashy (as in, I wonder if they even washed their hands today and eww, they're handling my sandwich), middle-aged, a-hole-ish and couldn't care less whether they filled your order correctly or not. So, given all this, why would ANYONE go to this place? There's not one selling point that I can think of..."
7594,9,1,1,6/20/2011,"Staff is so arrogant and rude. ˜Standed on line ""outside"" and stunk of their ˜ mediocre food. ˜There are plenty of other places to get a better cheesesteak without the attitude. Thumbs down!"
7595,9,2,1,6/19/2011,"First off, I'd like to start by saying that the people are super nice compared to the environment you get across the street (although I like Pat's 'aggressive' environment too). The steak was good... I just didn't like the texture of the meat as much as other places. If you like onions... this place doesn't fool around. Good stuff, my 2 stars is just cause I like other cheesesteak places more. Definitely nothing wrong with this place and I'd eat here again (if I was in the area and Pat's line was too long)... purely a preference call."
7596,9,2,1,6/18/2011,"Definitely the flashier of the two cornerstones in the cheesesteak competition. We went to Geno's first, drawn like moths to the hugely lit neon name. Tried the sandwich with whiz and cheese fries. Underwhelming, for all the pomp and circumstance surrounding this joint. At first, the kitsch is entertaining; there are picture frames mounted on every available surface, even the awning's ceiling, featuring servicemen and women enjoying a sandwich. The patriotism took a darker turn when we noticed the deliberately anti-immigrant signs (""If you can read this thank a teacher, if you can read this in English thank a marine"" etc). I was afraid to eat in front of that sign--imagining my dinner snatched out of my hands until I showed proper ID for the healthy tan I was sporting. Political taste aside, the food was bland. The meat was dry, the onions slightly less so. The famed whiz was the cheap rubbery kind that cemented my fries into one entity. A good place to hit up if you're interested in local landmarks, but not somewhere I would regularly throw down a ten for a mediumish meal."
7597,9,3,1,6/18/2011,"Took a drive with my family from New Jersey to Philadelphia. ˜Obviously, we checked out the tourist sites but one of the main reasons I wanted to go to Philadelphia was for the cheesesteaks. ˜Anyways, when we got here my husband got the cheesesteak ""wit wiz""... having never tried this before... I was surprised by how tasty it was. ˜It was kinda hard to make a true determination because I also tried the place across the street. ˜But between the two, I like Geno's the best!"
7598,9,4,1,6/15/2011,"I'm not a huge fan of the bigger slices of steak, but it works within the sandwich. The seasoning they put on the meat might give them the edge, but the folks working there are dbags."
7599,9,4,1,6/13/2011,"Drove down to South Philly. One of the Geno's customers in line told us she liked them better than Pat's. ˜Ordered a cheese whiz wit. ˜Came out fast. ˜Cheese fries were eh -not good, not bad. ˜Will stick with just the cheesesteak next time. ˜Cheesesteak itself was great, as was the bread it was on. In case it's not mentioned before, it's cash only. ˜Sandwiches served separately than the drinks and fries. ˜Line moved very fast for a Sunday afternoon. ˜Parking is hard to find, but we lucked out."
7600,9,1,1,6/12/2011,"Checked out the website. Heard the stories. Gino's is a bigot, and very arguably a racist. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT! I sloppily finished my Pat's sub at Gino's in silent protest."
7601,9,4,1,6/12/2011,"Went for breakfast while in town. ˜The lady at the register was very courteous and my cheesesteak was made pretty quickly. ˜Benches are outside the shop for customers, as well as condiments. ˜LOVED seeing the English-only signs! ˜This place is what America is all about!!!"
7602,9,1,1,6/11/2011,"Not a big fan of Geno's at all. ˜I think the steaks were bland and i highly ˜ dislike the fact that they only have one option for your cheese steak. ˜I will not go into the ""signs"" that they have at this location. ˜I would not waste my time going here again."
7603,9,2,1,6/9/2011,"So, as promised, I tried the guys across the street. ˜Overall, the steak was OK, the cheese good, but the bread was too chewy for my liking. ˜Good grease factor, but other things bring this place down: 1. Price. ˜$9 for a steak, $2 for a drink...I didn't even bother with fries. 2. I'm sure some of the cost of my food is going into funding all the touristy merch at this place. ˜Really? ˜You guys can't just serve steaks? 4. Service - surley...even for philly. ˜I've had better service from kidney thieves. 5. The pro-police, anti-immigrant crap. ˜I get it, cops are great. ˜What if I only speak italian, y'know, like some of your forefathers, do I still need to 'order in english'? If you like it, great, but I'll spend my $ at Pat's."
7604,9,1,1,6/5/2011,"Pat's is better than Geno's. ˜Pat's has been better than Geno's all of my life. ˜And Pat's will always be better than Geno's. ˜I consider this place an embarrassment to cheesesteaks. ˜Instead of political propaganda, how about concentrating on actually putting a fair amount of meat on your sandwiches?"

7608,9,2,1,5/31/2011,"Get your cash ready and know how to order before you get to the counter, oh, and make sure you speak English or they won't take your order. ˜In this city of 'brotherly love' I was extremely disappointed with the sign that clearly states you have to speak English- Geno's is patriotic, I will give them that, but simply rude. ˜Their sandwiches were only average. Do not go out of your way to go to South Philly and if you do go across the street to Pat's, it's a better sandwich for the same price."
5418,9,2,1,5/31/2011,"Sorry Geno's! But in a side by side taste test, Pat's won. Geno's bread is better than Pat's but overall the whole package just didn't cut it."
7609,9,1,1,5/31/2011,"So I guess the sandwiches here are alright (declared by Mike as superior to Pat's based on their cheese application and roll) and the cheese fries were whatever. Super salty, soaked with cheese (especially at the bottom), but hot, freshly fried, and pretty tasty. Their regular fries, doused in ketchup, were much of the same, also. That said - get bent, Geno's. Dude, Geno's sucks and I hate it on principle alone. The service here blows, and not in that kitschy Weiner's Circle way where it's fun to get yelled at or mistreated by the disgruntled staff. Like, it actually is bad and not part of the fun. Everything is grossly over priced and low-grade. And while they serve both Coke and Pepsi products, but not a Mt. Dew, Wild Cherry Pepsi, or Cherry Coke in sight. And, most of all, their crudely displayed racist sentiments are unappetizing and sleazy. Like, amidst all of the pro-police regalia are what appear to be anti-immigrant chain letters clearly printed from Microsoft Word or a Geocities page generated back in '00. Also, pictures of Donald Trump and (I heard) Sarah Palin. Okay, what the hell is going on here? What year is this? Good thing I didn't wear my ""Free Mumia"" t-shirt on this day. I'm going to decorate the exterior of my building with anit-Geno's propaganda and pictures of Barack. Geno's can go to hell. BONUS CONTENT: Some of the people who come here are just as bad. A lady in front of me asked for mushrooms on her steak, and then in the fry/soda line, she asked for lemon in her Diet Coke. Not in this lifetime, dummy."
7610,9,2,1,5/31/2011,"Visited Philly over the Memorial Day weekend. ˜I should of taken a clue when the line over at Pat's was so long and the line at Geno's was a non factor. ˜Ordered this with onions and provolone cheese. ˜The bread was good, but there was no flavor and the beef was kind of dry. ˜Had to put a lot of salt to eat this. ˜Go to Pat's for cheesesteak. ˜It's so much better."
7611,9,3,1,5/26/2011,"Geno's is okay, I prefer Pats which is across the street. There is always a line here as well. I learned very quickly that wen you order a cheessteak you have to get cheese whiz. I repeat do not get fancy and get provolone or any other cheese. The bread is good and you have to get onions and peppers as well. You cant go wrong if you stop by and get a cheese steak here. I been to a lot of places in Philly and this place is one of the better ones."
7612,9,2,1,5/25/2011,"Meh. I'm not a Philadelphian, but I can tell how touristy this pad is... The flashy lights are gaudy, and the employees seriously need to learn their place. If I want to eat a cheesesteak a particular way, that's how I'll eat it. Don't arm-wrestle me into whatever you want to say is the tradition. I rate this place low for pushiness, and lack of interest in catering to the customer. No more of my money will be going into this establishment."
7613,9,2,1,5/24/2011,"If Philly Cheesesteak is one of the most essential food that represents Philadelphia, then Geno is definitely NOT the place to be. ˜I came to Philly along with friends & coworkers to try those two famous rivals across the street. ˜I have to say, after trying at both Geno's and Pat's. ˜Pats across the street wins hands down. Geno's selection are not as good at Pats, and the beef is kinda blah. ˜Not to mention their overall presentation. ˜ Greasy and tasteless. ˜Dry beef with some nasty beefy taste, ˜Cheese is very bland, and the bread were HARD to chew...I feel like they must mixed with some gum when making the bread. ˜Its hard to eat without any other condiments. ˜ The only thing that I like about this store is their bright neon light. I would highly suggest the owner to improve the taste of the food and spend less money on advertising campaigns"
7614,9,1,1,5/23/2011,"They say that Geno's and Pat's are rivals to the end. Who makes the best of best Philly Cheese Steaks? In my opinoin, I say Pat's is the better choice. Geno lack the flavor, the texture was ultimately soggy, & the there wasnt much of a kicker to anything that I got ..Even the Cheese fries was simply plain. If your at Geno's I recommend you cross that street to Patt's."
7615,9,2,1,5/20/2011,What Philly trip is complete without visiting Geno's and Pat's? ˜ Ordered a Geno's with provolone. It was okay this time around. ˜While the provolone steak proportion was good compared to Jim's. ˜It was still a little on the bland side. ˜The bread was really good though! Overall it didn't meet my expectations. ˜I think the travel channel and food network people that make these sandwiches seem like the best thing on earth should tone it down.
7616,9,3,1,5/19/2011,"Very good, worth a taste if you are doing both!"
7617,9,4,1,5/16/2011,"They say this is a tourist steak place, but i disagree.. I always get the wiz with out and I love it!!! Never had a bad steak here"
7618,9,2,1,5/14/2011,"So there's this whole rivalry between Geno's and Pat's (very Jets and Sharks), and when we were visiting Philly we ate at Geno's because I'm not exactly a Cheez-Whiz fan (apparently Pat's sticks more to the ""original"" cheesesteak, which comes with Whiz). When you order a cheesesteak, you don't want to come off like a total tourist. So if you want it with onions, you just say ""with"" and if you want it with provolone or whiz, you just say either ""provolone"" or ""whiz."" Pretty self explanatory, no? So for example, I wanted a cheesesteak with onions and provolone, so I would just walk up and say, ""With provolone"" (or ""provolone, with""). If you just wanted Whiz on your sandwich, you would literally walk up to the window and just say, ""Whiz."" Don't be a doucher and just say ""with,"" because, hello, it's a cheesesteak -- you're supposed to get some kind of cheese on it. Anyway, the cheesesteak was meh. Also, it's outdoor picnic-style seating, so it's not very clean, but who cares? You're eating a greasy sandwich with fake cheese on it. Bring hand sanitizer."
7619,9,3,1,5/14/2011,"I dont understand why this place isnt rated that good. I loved this place, the cheesesteaks are just not at all like any kinds in Cali. Loved the place and how Pat's was across the street. I went to both while visiting and I liked this one better but thats probably because I split one from each with my brother and he messed up the Pat's one with cheese wiz that I didnt like. But loved this place"
7620,9,3,1,5/12/2011,"For those of you who don't know much about Philly...here's a hint ""You can't live, visit, fly nor drive through Philly and not try a cheesesteak hoagie!"" ... there is a rivalry between Pat's king and Geno's and Geno's wins up in my book. ˜ Yum!"
7621,9,1,1,5/11/2011,"As a lifelong Pat's fan, I'm reminded of the immortal words of Blair Waldorf: ""You are disgusting, and I hate you."""
7622,9,3,1,5/10/2011,"I usually get the cheesesteak here ""wit wiz"" (with onions and cheeze wiz). ˜Admittedly, the quality of the sandwich varies greatly. ˜Sometimes, there's too little (or too much) cheese or the bread is a little stale tasting or whatever... but nonetheless, overall, it's always a solid eat here...and it's still better than the ""cheesesteaks"" from areas other than Philly (as for comparing Geno's with other places in Philly, that's another story/debate....). That being said, it does feel like a giant tourist trap and a bit pricey for what it really is. ˜And don't expect your cashiers and order takers to be friendly either.... just know what you want before you step up to the ordering counter and order quickly. ˜If not, everybody (employees and other customers in line) will get mad at you :P ˜I'm also not a super big fan of the Tea Party-esque political propaganda and ""speak English"" signs posted everywhere either.... ˜but I'll swing by whenever I'm in the area."
7623,9,2,1,5/9/2011,"Was in Philly for the night and decided I had to stop and check out the whole cheesesteak debate. Pat's wins, but I am not sure what they win. Geno's is ""cleaner"" if that makes sense? Everything is a little more polished, to its detriment. Weak bread, weak serving size, and wayyyy too much. $9 for steakums and cheeze wiz is highway robbery for a place in the boonies. The only thing keeping both of these places alive is the traffic they get from the food channel. I ˜would not suggest to anyone to make the trek out there to eat."
7624,9,1,1,5/7/2011,"I really enjoyed my cheesesteak. Ketchup was good too, since it was fresh, and the hot sauce is spicier than average. But I hated the lighting and the ridiculous signs saying only English was allowed. I'm sure I speak English better than any of the folks there, but I bet they wouldn't stop giving me sidelong glances even if they knew that."
7625,9,2,1,5/6/2011,"Geno's is weaker than Pat's in flavor, texture, and just in general. ˜Their bread is pretty good though. ˜The flashy design is a big difference compared to Pat's subdued white paint job and didn't really impress me much. ˜I ordered my steak sandwich with onion and cheese whiz. ˜The meat was cut in bigger pieces than Pat's and had more fat making it less appealing. ˜The overall flavor was not as pronounced as Pat's and left me disappointed. ˜Many similarities abound between this place and Pat's. ˜Oddly enough, the pricing is exactly the same as Pat's and the menu choices are very close as well. ˜Even though it's only right across the street from Pat's, Geno's seems like it's in a less-friendly location. ˜ -I wonder if the same person secretly owns both and just gets all of the profits. ˜I most likely will not choose Geno's on my next visit."
7626,9,4,1,5/6/2011,Geno's vs Pats= GENOS!
7627,9,4,1,5/5/2011,"Whenever I'm in Philadelphia, the highlight of my trip is a visit to Geno's. I have not tried Pat's yet (across the street), but I've always wanted to. The line for both of these places are always long, so for some reason or another (Oooo look at the pretty lights) I've just always stood in front of Geno's. I remember the first time I bit into of one of their cheesesteaks. I took a good look at it and was very confused. It looked nothing like what I had been eating for my 26 years? It didn't taste like it either? SO WAIT....is this how a Cheesesteak is supposed to taste like? Because this tastes damn good. {Bread} Light and fluffy. Yet substantial enough to hold the meat, cheese whiz, and onions in place. {Meat} Not greasy. Not salty or over seasoned. Thinly sliced. Juicy. Though, I wish they put MORE slices in there. {Cheese Whiz} Oh so cheesy. A bit salty. Holds the sandwich in place. {Diced onions} Bits of chopped sauteed onions complete this sandwich. It's simple. Everything on the sandwich seems to highlight one thing- THE MEAT. Compared to the ""Philly Cheesesteaks"" I've had in the past (which were good), this was lighter and still flavorful. One could have seriously eaten 2 of these with ease. Yes, its pricey. But since I only come here once in a blue moon, I guess I'm willing to fork out some cash for an authentic Philly Cheesesteak. Now I've got to try Pat's..."
7628,9,4,1,5/3/2011,"Geno's gave me my first authentic cheese-steak experience about a week ago, and i'm still craving another one. ˜The service was lightning fast while preserving the quality of my sandwich. ˜I must admit it's purely junk food, but I didn't feel like I overate after I was done. ˜I would have given it 5 stars but at $9 a sandwich Geno's might be overcharging a little to much."
7629,9,1,1,4/28/2011,"This is America, and we have the right to free speech, one of the many freedoms that make this country great. ˜That being said, I'm going to exercise my free speech and say that the ""This is America, when ordering, speak English"" sign, and the numerous other signs (yes, last I checked they are still up there) outside Geno's are hypocritical, RACIST and flat out ignorant. ˜Plus their steaks are sh*t. Congratulations, Geno's, you've added nothing to this community but hate-mongering propaganda and crappy hoagies. Bravo. ˜I mean ""well done."" Sorry."
7630,9,2,1,4/26/2011,"Needs more salt. It's tasty, if you're a beef lover, it'll be good, but I found myself adding way too much salt and katchup to it to give it any higher star(s). With Pats accross the street, it's not a far walk to get some good steak on bread. Cheers, -Herbal Tea"
7631,9,2,1,4/26/2011,"You can't miss Geno's with their loud Vegas lights. ˜Those lights also attract major bugs! ˜You'll constantly hear mosquitos get zapped (electric bug killer on the ceiling) as you wait in line for your food. ˜I was offended by the ""order in english"" sign. ˜But the sandwich.. the sandwich! ˜The bread was stale, the meat was sparse, not enough cheese... why you go cheap on me G? ˜If you've never been.. you need to try this at least once but only once. ˜Otherwise..I've experienced better... ACROSS THE STREET! ˜Pat's Pat's Pat's!"
7632,9,1,1,4/23/2011,"I like roasted red peppers on my cheesesteak. Is that too much to ask for? Apparently. I know I'm supposed to follow the posted signs that force you to speak like a local, but I thought, ""C'mon, they can't get THAT mad, right?"" The woman looked at me like I had two heads when I said, ""Umm can I have a cheesesteak with fried onions and roasted peppers?"" Luckily I wasn't turned away and she took my order, albeit rudely. After close to $9 (I didn't even order a beverage), what I got was a pepper-less, stale cheesesteak and a finger point in the direction of a picnic table that had large, sticky jars of sweet peppers floating around. They'd probably been sitting there for weeks. The bland cheesesteak combined with the fluorescent lighting and racist propaganda has forever turned me away anytime a drunk friend suggests a 3 a.m. trek there. Steaks on South (S.O.S.) is far better."
7633,9,2,1,4/22/2011,"I should've listened to all the local fellow yelpers on this one... BUT, we wanted to do our own ""FOOD FEUD"" and started with Geno and then went to Pats... ˜I probably would've given them a higher rating had we not enjoyed a departure cheesesteak at Carmen's (Reading Market!). ˜Between Geno and Pat - Geno won for us - the bread was fresh and tasty and the meat (skimpy) was not as greasy as Pat. ˜It packs a crowd (both establishments), but as a fellow yelper pointed out - it definitely is the tourist trap appeal. ˜Taste around the city folks, you WILL find a cheesesteak that makes Philly proud!"
7634,9,2,1,4/21/2011,"It is the tail end of lunchtime on a Friday, and there are throngs of people at both Geno's and Pat's, crowds creeping back out onto the road. We decide to hit Geno's first. Juliet volunteers to order, having boned up on proper etiquette. There is a window for cheese steaks, and another window for drinks and fries. While she waits in the longer line, I acquire a Birch Beer and some cheese fries. Signs in the windows proclaim Geno's support for Trump in the next Presidential race; warnings if you don't speak English or you don't order correctly; and plenty of star-spangled banners. It feels like I'm at a Tea Party rally. With a bit of luck and patience, we secure a small picnic table and unveil the beast. We tear the foot long in half, then dig in. The bread is soft; the shaved meat is juicy; the onions are sweet, weeping; and the Cheese Whiz is...well, Cheese Whiz. In the end, it is nothing special, just a somewhat thin sub with some anemic, salty, and overly-processed ingredients. The Birch Beer does wonders to wash it down. The cheese fries are pretty good, though. Better than the sandwich. Eager to work our way up the food chain, we cross the street and prepare for Pat's. I step up this time to order, paying close attention to the instructions printed next to the window. I say, ""One provolone wit"". Translation: ""One cheesesteak with provolone cheese and with onions."" I feel like a local when the guy takes my money, hands back the change, and another guy shoves a sub at me. I'm getting the hang of this! Unfortunately, there are no available seats. People are like scavengers, rushing to the nearest open picnic table and wolfing down their late lunches. We end up at one of the standing rails, clustered close together against the brisk wind. The sandwich tears apart easily. I take my first bite and prepare for the onslaught of meat and cheese...only to be met with nothing. Nada. Zip. Bupkis. I don't taste bread, meat, onions, or cheese. What in tarnation? I eat more slowly, rolling each bite around on my tongue, trying to tease the flavors out. Still, it eludes me. The preparation is either too light a touch, or Geno's has ruined me. Maybe that's their secret weapon: ruin your taste buds before you try the competition. But don't take my word for it. Read what my better half has to say at our website (linked in my profile)."
7635,9,2,1,4/19/2011,"They spend way too much time on being racist and the lighting. ˜The steak comes out to like 8 bucks or something and I ended up spending around 20 on a steak that was on a semi stale roll with raw onions (they give you nasty breath) and not enough of wiz. ˜A cheese steak should have sauted onions almost caramelized and the cheese should be cut into the steak or at least melted enough that it mixes in with the onions and bits of steak and grease. ˜Now that just made me hungry. ˜The cheese fries are good enough tho. Bottom line- come here for late night crap steaks, this place is built for tourists, if you want a real steak find a truck near any university campus if not then come here."
7636,9,2,1,4/19/2011,Meh. I had Geno's before Pats and was kind of disappointed. The sandwich was decent but the juices from the whole pieces of steak made the Wiz in my sandwich soggy. The hot sauce they have out on the condiment bar is seriously spicy like it says. I'm usually a spicy/hot sauce eater but this sauce was way too spicy. I wish they had something in between.
7637,9,4,1,4/19/2011,Wiz with & Wiz fries make even the longest road trip seem so far away in my mind. Thank you Geno's for bringin it when I needed it the most.
7638,9,5,1,4/19/2011,"Fucking yum! Hitting up Genos was a highlight for this Southern Cali dwelling slob. Great food, and I love the attitude these guys have, and the love they have for the police, military, and America gets my blood pumpin'.

7639,9,2,1,4/16/2011,"Geno's is ok. I definitely like Pat's better because they have better steak. However, Geno's has better bread since it's softer. Geno's is definitely way more flashy than Pat's (orange color, a lot of lights at night). The only thing I like about Geno's (other than the bread) is the service, the people are much nicer here compared to Pat's. If you guys decide to go here, order the Cheese Wiz, it's the best one."
7640,9,2,1,4/15/2011,Was in Philly during a vacation so wife and I decided to try the famous Pat's and Genos and put them up against each other. ˜ We got one sandwich from each shop (catty corner from each other). ˜ We came here at the off hour of around 3PM on a weekday so they weren't busy at all and should have had time to make our cheese steaks properly. Verdict: ˜Meh. Meat: Dry and tough Bread: Not bad Cheese: Provolone wasn't even melted. We were not impressed with either. ˜We've had better in San Diego. I cut and paste this review for Pat's because it applies there too.
7641,9,2,1,4/14/2011,"Onions are good, but this place is pretty pedestrian. Not a fan of the sheets of meat either. I guess its in business because of suckers like me from out of town. Shoulda just gone to Jerry's."

7643,9,4,1,4/12/2011,"The sandwich and cheese fries are on point, they just have terrible customer service. They act like you the customer owes them something. What a shame because the food is pretty good."
7644,9,3,1,4/11/2011,"I liked Geno's better than Pat's; juicier and more tender. It also had a very tasty hot sauce at its condiment bar. That said, I was a little disappointed; it'd be a great sandwich back home, but it wasn't quite what I was expecting from a Philadelphia cheesesteak. I had another cheesesteak elsewhere and it was delicious, but neither Pat's nor Geno's quite lived up to their reputations."
7645,9,4,1,4/9/2011,"I just came back to philly from DC. If you want a more juicier and less saltier tasting cheese steak, go to GENOS. Way better then Pat's! The fries were ok...I would defintly go back for the cheese steak!!"
7646,9,5,1,4/8/2011,"The legend. What else can I say; pure steaky, cheesey, oniony ambrosia. Bread is perfect, steaks are perfect...I got mine with onions and american instead of the goopy cheez wiz. Definitely a bucket list stop."
7647,9,4,1,4/6/2011,"Legendary Cheesesteak house competing with Pat's on the facing corner. As for me, I prefer Geno's to Pat's. I think the cheesesteaks are better. The only way to know for yourself is to try it yourself."
7648,9,1,1,4/4/2011,"We were taking a tour of the Italian market on a nice saturday morning and at the end of the tour they took us to Geno and Pat's. Everyone know about what Philly is best known for -CHEESESTEAK!! I told my friend to go to the Geno line and order 1 Wit whiz and I will do the same but I will go to Pat's so we can switch and compare who is really the best between these 2. The lines were much longer at pat's but Geno has better lighting and signs(gimmicks). Our tour guy told us that Geno has a policy toward people who buy their cheesesteak. The policy is that you have to speak in ENGLISH!! Wow i couldn't believe what I had hear but i really wanted to see if their cheesesteak are good or not. That is very rascist and of all person, he should know about being a immgraints from another country. Anyway I don't really want to talk about policy so I am focusing on the food. The cheesesteak here, we get more meats and it isn't chop up like pat's. The flavor is alittle bland for my taste. Overall very disappointing sandwich and I have no clue why people would ever compare this to one of the best cheesesteak. There are soo many other choices such as Jim, John Roasted Pork, Tony Luke, and Pat's. I was happy that i got a chance to finally try it but disappointed in all of the hype considering their cheesesteak. I realize people or me shouldn't watch so many Travel channel and Food network because everything is made more for tv and once you actually get a chance to try it. It is one great disappointment!!!"
7649,9,3,1,4/4/2011,"A good steak sandwich, but certainly no Tony Luke's. ˜Cool that the guy supports our troops and has tons of famous people pictures, but sandwich to sandwich, it's just not as good."
7650,9,3,1,3/30/2011,"The decor, staff and cheese fries saved this place for me. The cheesesteaks didn't ˜make a statement for my taste buds. ˜My bf and I only had a day and half in Philly so we had to do pats and genos on the same day, one right after the other. It was a good thing for me tho. That way I was able to tell which was better. Pat's was! ˜The steak here was a bit dry and bland for me."
7651,9,4,1,3/30/2011,"Come on ... you can't write about Geno's and not Pat's and vice versa. ˜These 2 establishments of delicious meat and dairy products are forever linked and happily so. Odds are if you are looking at the review you are wondering which is better, Pat's or Geno's. ˜Honestly ... your best bet is to bring a friend and each of you get a steak from one of the locations and you split them. For my money I think Pat's wins on the ""initial taste"" barometer. ˜It hits you just right and makes you crave a 2nd and 3rd bite. ˜That being said, I think Geno's sits in the stomach better and is a better ""total experience""."
7652,9,5,1,3/30/2011,"5 star review simply because the meat itself was so tender and a cut above the rest of the other places (jims, pats, etc...) But I have been eatting from here for the past 12 years or so now, and notonce have I gotten SICK, I did have Pat's once and I was sick for a few days later... Butquite frannkly I just simply love the atmosphere, even if some of the workers look pissed off. As for the signs, BIG deal! I meansure everyone has an opinion, but obviously Joey Vento's opinion includes a ""Speak English while ordering"" or even calling french fries ""freedom"" fries. Which, by the way I'll be willing to bet nobodyknows the reason behind it. Anyway, GENO'S STEAKS will always be #1 not only in the city, but also wit me."
7653,9,4,1,3/29/2011,"This is one of those great debates, and everyone has their own opinion on the matter. I couldn't wait to get my butt to Philly on my last trip to the east coast just to try these cheesesteaks for myself. I tried both Pat's and Geno's back to back, 'with and provolone'. Geno's was the clear winner, with a much tastier/juicier stack of meat. This is a must-try!"
7654,9,1,1,3/24/2011,"Disgusting tourist trap. ˜No self respecting person in this tri-state area would ever eat there. ˜This place literally makes one of the WORST cheesesteaks in the city. ˜ANY food truck will make you a larger, better tasting, and MUCH cheaper cheesesteak, and you don't have to deal with bullshit signage, blatant racism, or drunken ""bridge and tunnel"" douchebags."
7655,9,4,1,3/23/2011,"Well to answer the big question, yes it was worth the trip!!! My first ever Philly cheesesteak and it did not disappoint at all. Be prepared for a little bit of a wait, but it is well worth it."
7656,9,1,1,3/20/2011,"It's times like these I wish giving zero stars was an option. My boyfriend and I decided to come to Philly for a night on our spring break from grad school. We wanted to do the Pat's/Geno's taste test, but only made it to Geno's before getting too full to take on Pat's (we got 2 cheesesteaks, one wit provolone and one wit whiz, two cheese fries, and two birch beers). We decided to try Pat's on our way out of Philly the next day and carried on with our sightseeing trip. Cut to 4 hours later and we're both violently ill in our tiny (one bathroom) hotel room. While I've frequently lurked on Yelp before, this is the first time that I've ever been enraged enough to actually write a review. This meal at Geno's ruined our entire trip to Philly and now we're stuck in our hotel room playing cards in between trips to the bathroom. Thanks a lot, Geno's!"
7657,9,2,1,3/20/2011,Pat's across the street is MUCH better. These are just sub par to ok not really worth the hype IMO.
7658,9,3,1,3/17/2011,"3 Stars This would be a four star review if it wasn't for the ""freedom fries"" and other lame signs they had posted in the window.....and everybody out in Philly says the owner is racist, but I'll leave that alone. They had an advantage off the bat b/c I was wasted when i came here after drinking in Old City. I got a sandwich w/ onions and cheese wiz, one with onions and American cheese, and some fries. I also tried some of the roast pork sandwich my friend ordered. - Bread was fresh - a lot better than Pat's - Meat was good - better than Pat's - No line - it was 3 something in the morning, so neither Geno's nor Pat's had a line - Sandwich w/ Wiz and onions - very good - Sandwich w/ American, onions, and mushrooms - very good (Mushrooms looked and tasted like they were out of a can though; I could do w/o them next time) - Fries - very good - Roast Pork - ok (but I don't like the taste of roast pork that much, so you've gotta try it for yourself; my friend likes pork and he said it was really good) - Service - decent considering that we were acting up and probably annoying the hell out of all the employees - Ambiance - too flashy for me, but it stands out....and that's probably what they were going for. I know I'll be back here late night next time I'm in Philly"
7659,9,2,1,3/16/2011,"I waited until I tried both Pat's and Geno's to write my review and I'm going to have to side with Pat's. Geno's wasn't horrible as I have had worse cheesesteaks in my life, but the steak at Pat's was juicier and wasn't overpowered by the cheese."
7660,9,1,1,3/15/2011,"It was ok. Did not live up to the hype. I've had better cheese steaks at the Jersey shore. The peppers and onions are from jars, not fresh. Very disapointing."
7661,9,1,1,3/15/2011,"I just moved to PA about 3 months ago and I made it my thing to test out philly cheesesteaks from every restaurant I come across in philly. This is by far the worst I've ever had. I went to Pat's several times and I decided this time to give Geno's a chance, especially since I had 3 of my friends come up to visit me...biggest mistake ever. It was greasy, flavorless, the meat sucked, and the bread was probably the only decent part of the sandwich. None of us wanted to finish our sandwiches. ˜And not only that, they were pretty rude and they do have some pretty offensive stuff on the window where you order your food. Pretty low class of them if you ask me. So I definitely would recommend going across the street to Pat's because Geno's cheesesteaks are just plain terrible. Good thing they have all those ridiculous lights to help them attract new customers because I'm pretty sure their sandwiches can't do it for them."
7662,9,4,1,3/10/2011,"It's an ageless debate whether Pat's or Geno's are better. ˜Here's a comparison: Geno: Less meat, meat slightly tender and more seasoning Cheese wiz thinner - more runny Bread is softer, I think they steam the bread but because it's Italian bread, a little chewy after steaming Sandwich is presented tightly wrapped - easy to carry around. The wrapper is bigger and non-porous General appearance is cleaner and brighter Pat: More meat, less tender, not seasoned at all Thicker chess wiz Bread is more crunchy They give the sandwich to you un-wrapped in a much smaller piece of wrapper. The wrapper is porous - oil sip through makes eating messy. General appearance darker and less clean"
7663,9,3,1,3/7/2011,"Geno's is good... but, Pat's is better! The best part about Geno's is the bread and they don't give nearly as much meat as Pat's but it still tastes good. I would def. suggest doing the taste test on your own for the full experience!"
7664,9,1,1,3/6/2011,Checked out ˜both Pat's and Geno's...not sure what the big deal is??? ˜No flavor...all I can say...great tourist trap!
7665,9,1,1,3/4/2011,"First of All, $8.50 for a crappy cheese steak is a bad idea. They are cash only, and for all the hype that's with this place, I really wonder if people have lost their minds. If I wanted cheap Italian bread made with STEAKUM meat from a hairy guy who doesn't like to prepare food with gloves, I would've...well...actually who WOULD want that? Outdoor seating only, so it is not cold weather friendly. Also apart from the overpriced dog meat, I felt like the size of the sandwich was just downright offensive. When we asked locals about Geno's the next day, they said it was an overpriced joke too. If you want a REAL cheese steak, go to Jim's Steaks on South. Don't wast your time at Geno's. It's not even worth saying you've been there."
7666,9,4,1,2/26/2011,I've been coming here since I was a kid and could barely see over the counter. It's a right of passage if you live in South Philly. You can't just order anytime of way. You have to say you want it wiz wit. I know it sounds crazy but that's how it's done. The classic is a cheesesteak with cheese wiz and onions. Everyone has there favorite but this is mine ˜and I will eventually bring my kids here to have there arteries clogged also.
7667,9,4,1,2/25/2011,"As all other people, I tested the Geno's-Pat's rivalry. Pat's asked for the order and gave it to me before I even finished my order! Geno's, on the other hand, granted my request. Similar steaks, but I'd go with Geno's."
7668,9,2,1,2/22/2011,"Geno's & Pat's are slightly different but both are pretty sloppy and not that great. Plenty of restaurants have them beat in quality, service, & tastiness. You only go here for the experience because they claim to be the ""Original Philly Steak."""
7669,9,2,1,2/22/2011,"I must say, the glitz and glam of the place was impressive. ˜But the workers weren't exactly friendly (although, I do realize that service is not the #1 reason to go to a cheesesteak place). In fact, they were a little scary. If I were to rate the cheesesteak by itself I would say it was average. If someone were to offer it to me, I'd eat it. But compared to other cheesesteak places, it wasn't the best. The meat didn't seem flavored at all. Maybe it's because I didn't get it with cheese whiz, but the sandwich definitely didn't live up to it's hype. ˜I ended up crossing the street to Pat's to try their cheesesteak which was a lot better than Geno's."
7670,9,3,1,2/18/2011,"Was here to compare the Pat's Geno rivalry and I have to say, I prefer Pat's even though the line at Pat's was longer. This was a pretty good sandwich as far as sandwich goes, great textures with the steak and bread and great flavors. However, I prefer Pat's because I felt the flavors at Pat's was more distinct and savory. Geno's however, has a more photogenic sign."
7671,9,4,1,2/15/2011,"First off: NOT a fan of Pat's - too many bad bad experiences. You don't even wanna know. ˜Never tried Geno's. Figured it was same'ol same'ol. ˜So last wk, still starving after drinks and appetizers with friends much earlier, passing Geno's I stopped in and got a steak american wit. ˜Wit'out much anticipation, and from years of bad experience, I hesitatingly bit into one of the best steaks I've ever had. Was it hunger? That particular night? I dunno. But THIS obese sheep was pretty happy. Luckily I put too much hot (ouch!!!) sauce on it and stopped eating it halfway through before I fainted. But what I had was Awwwwsome."
7672,9,3,1,2/15/2011,"This is another ""Don't Believe The Hype"" Steak As a part of what I have come to think about as ""operation cheesesteak"" in my head, I am going to as many hyped and non-hyped steak places as my heart can handle. I base my rating ONLY on the taste of steak that has been pared down to it's most essential of elements: Bread, Steak and Provolone Cheese (I can't do artificial cheese, sorry folks). ˜I only go when I'm starving, and I usually eat half in my car and half at home. Today I got that hunger pang, and to Geno's I went. Geno's steak is a mediocre steak. ˜Edible, but mediocre. ˜Don't get me wrong, the establishment has a glitzy facade, and a cheesesteak turf war that is unrivaled ... but the steak itself is just average. ˜The ˜construction of the steak is sliced meat on top of sliced provolone on a bun. ˜The steak was good, but not spectacular. ˜I can forgive having cheese that's not melted throughout when you're working with steak slices, but I do like when the meat is hot enough to melt the cheese. ˜This was not the case with my steak. ˜And the bread was okay ... but not incredible either. ˜The mediocrity remained after the steak cooled off. Tony Luke's is still killing it, so far. Despite that, I will say that in my opinion, Geno's is a better steak than Pat's for 3 reasons: #1 No gristle in the meat (if you've read any of my other reviews, you know that's a dealbreaker for me). #2 It was not ridiculously greasy like Pat's steak was. #3 At 8.50, it was a bigger steak than Pat's provides at the same price. Turf war, solved."
7673,9,4,1,2/15/2011,Had some Pat's and immediately walked across to Geno's to compare. Gotta give to to Geno's by a nose but I prefer the classic feel of Pat's.
7674,9,3,1,2/13/2011,"Well, here is another three star rating and this is why . I am a native Californian so I can picture it already. ""EY, Waddayanow about steaks?"" Well, l may not know cheesesteaks, but I know what I like. I did like the sandwich, but it wasn't what I thought it would be. It had good flavor, and I loved the onions. I ordered it ""wizz, wit"" and I was surprised how FAST they get things done. I also got the cheese fries and a drink. All in all it was around $15 (!) and I ate it right there on the benches. Yes, it was cold with the wind blowing. The best way I can describe it is to draw a parallel observation with another LA landmark that people rave and fawn over. King Taco. Sure, they make good food. Sure they serve tons of customers every night and are rather well known. Sure they make GREAT late night stops. However, late night munchies are not really the best way to judge foodstuffs. Perhaps being soaked in booze from late night carousing adds to the overall experience. There is NOTHING wrong with that. Just in the same way I like King Taco, I liked Geno's. I however, have had better cheesesteaks. So far, the best cheesesteak I have had in the US was at Moochie's in Salt Lake City. It is not blasphemy, and it in no way takes Geno's down for what it is. A pioneer in the field of cheeseteaks with a history only perhaps one other restaurant can rival. That rivalry I am sure also adds to the legend. Still, 3 stars for the food. -Subject to change based on intoxication-"
7675,9,2,1,2/11/2011,I find that those small carts throughout center city makes a better cheesesteak than Genos.
7676,9,5,1,2/2/2011,I came to Philly to fish out the rivalry between Geno's Steaks and Pat's. What's great about the winter is that there are no lines! So that was a plus. ˜My friend and I tried Geno's first and fell in love. The meat was very tender and juicy and it was a good amount to eat. ˜I've heard of people telling me there are other places that have better cheesesteaks but we just wanted to experience the more well known.
7677,9,2,1,2/2/2011,"The flare of the place is awesome, and the history is too, but they rush you, the cheesesteaks are small, and the fact that you have to pay cash is really 1970's. Don't get me wrong, the steaks don't taste bad, but there are so many other places that i've experienced better in philly. If this was in Cleveland, or Miami, i'd give it a 4 or 5 star, but for philly, it's just mediocre. Saying all that...if you are in the area, you have to stop by and taste test between Pat's and Geno's...one of each!"
7678,9,2,1,2/1/2011,"I came here on a trip to Philly, hearing the thousands of stories about it. I really love cheese steaks and was really excited to try the "" famous genos"". The stories plus the travel channel shows really made me want to try them even more. But something was wrong, it wasn't the best it was suppose to be! Wasn't even close to some other ones I've had. A few things were lacking such as size and cheese. I was expecting a monster sandwich and all I got was a average one. I am also not a huge fan of cheese wiz but I won't doc them from that. Maybe I should give them another chance. But considering all the the good eats in Philly, I might not. It's up to you to decide!"
7679,9,1,1,1/28/2011,"I would have to say this is the worst cheesesteak joint in philly. ˜Like they said in almost every other review, it is a tourist trap. ˜All the flashy lights outside of their joint may make it look appealing but it really isn't. My qualm about this cheesesteak is that the meat is not chopped up like all the other kinds in philly, but all they do is grill 3 thin slices of the meat and put in on the sandwich and for $9. I really don't think its worth it. So to all the tourist reading this and wanting to try real authentic cheesesteaks, I would suggest you go somewhere else, maybe across the street to pats which is better than this joint, I would suggest John's Roast Pork or Tony Luke."
7680,9,5,1,1/27/2011,"2nd Best cheese steak in Philly, hands down. (1st is Pat's on South St.) And I lived there for 4 years! so I definitely had my share of cheese steaks! To all the people who rated this place with 1 star just because of their signs plastered everywhere... Ok... so they're blatantly and openly prejudiced... freedom of speech anyone? Although I don't share their views, I can appreciate their bold and adamant rebellion against what they feel is going on in the country. I think anyone and everyone has the right to post whatever statements they want, on both sides of any argument! MORE IMPORTANTLY, if you've been there... you OBVIOUSLY know that their racist signs and overt displays of hatred to non-americanism DO NOT AFFECT THEIR BUSINESS! They have a line of at least 10-40 people for cheese steaks at most times of day!! So just ignore the signs and posters that offend you, and enjoy the fantastic cheese steak!! (The fries are good too!)"
7681,9,3,1,1/27/2011,"Yes it was a great cheesesteak but I dont think it lived up to the hype. I wanted more stuff on mine and more flavors than just whiz and onions. Big line but it moves quick. Ate one cheesesteak from genos then walked over and ate a cheesesteak from Pats. ˜Liked pats SLIGHTLY better but again, I wanted a bigger selection of stuff. ˜ ˜ I was satisfied, however, I could not walk afterwards for several minutes after this venture for fear of exploding."
7682,9,5,1,1/26/2011,"OMG! I never expected to fall in love with a cheesesteak like I did at Geno's. I am from LA, and have heard many reviews and trust me, you have to try it. It just melts right in your mouth.. I can't wait to visit Philly again, and eat some more.!!!"
7683,9,2,1,1/24/2011,"This place is not good. I was not impressed. ˜I ate here with three other people who have traveled many places and we could not see how anyone thought this was good. I would rather get a double cheesburger from Burger King, it would be more satisifing."
7684,9,4,1,1/21/2011,"Okay, sue me for being a tourist. I came here to take my friend who is visiting from LA, and true to FORM, i had half a steak sandwich from Geno's and half a steak sandwich from Pat's. As the Director of the Board of Judges in my own personal competition, I LIKED GENO's BETTER. because for me, A SOFT BUN IS KEY! i like the balance of not too much steak, cheese and a soft bun - kinda like a grown up melt-in-yer-mouth sandwich... the one thing that irks me is that they are not too welcoming to tourists- god knows how to order in this side of town, and its just downright disappointing service wise. ill forgive them for rude service since once they hand you your drink and sandwich, you don't have to deal with them anymore. Now i want to try the other cheesesteaks."
7685,9,1,1,1/21/2011,"What I've Learned Today: - I've learned it's okay to post a sign bearing an offensive comment as long as you include and place emphasis on the word ""please"". - I've learned that if a business engages in charitable acts and philanthropy, this makes it more aesthetically pleasing. - I've learned that merely visiting a sandwich shop and eating their food does not sufficiently qualify you to say things about said establishment or its food. Geno's can suck it. I would *gasp* go to Jim's before I went to Geno's! Ooops....I mean, Geno's can suck it PLEASE."
7686,9,3,1,1/19/2011,"For the record, I went knowing it was a tourist trap, but it was still worth it for the Whiz, baby. I'd say that Geno's is a stop worth making if you're from out of town and looking for your first cheese steak. The reality is, you're probably going to kick around the Italian market as it is and if you don't like Geno's, you can walk across the street to Pat's, and if you don't like either, well, you've probably fallen off your bike and smacked your melon. Go, load it up with onions and whiz and enjoy all four seconds of hoovering."
7687,9,3,1,1/18/2011,"Ok steaks. Better than Pat's I feel. Nothing to brag about. ˜Food does not have that fresh taste that other steaks have. ˜Steaks are on the small side. ˜Don't get the fries cuz the cooking oil leaves an awful taste in your mouth. ˜Not saying its terrible, but it's not worth all the publicity. ˜Many better spots."
7688,9,1,1,1/18/2011,"The only thing worst than the steak here are..... I have so many ways to finish that sentence. ˜Let's see, the prices, the service, the suggestion that English is our official language, and the eyesore it is on the neighborhood. ˜I think that's the worse one. ˜ Who knew you could use tanning booth lights to decorate you business? ˜I honestly can't think of any reason to visit here."
7689,9,3,1,1/18/2011,"Geno's is not the best, I'm sorry people, they are most definitely the coolest looking cheese steak spot in Philly no doubt about that, but their steak meat is kinda bland, and yeah, Pat's across the street is better, if you don't believe me do a steak by steak comparison and find out for your self... And oh yeah, THEY ARE RACIST as hell...sorry not my shtick, but i still gave em 3 stars so you know I'm not hate'n that hard...."
7690,9,4,1,1/17/2011,"Big fan of Geno's steaks, with onions and cheese wiz. This place is what it is, nothing more or less. Great bread, just a great cheesesteak. I find Pat's to be greasier. As others have said, fries are not good, not worth it, just frozen fries. Cash only, but several ATMs next door."
7691,9,1,1,1/16/2011,"Didn't even try the food because couldn't stand the disgusting, xenophobic, racist signs on the front. ""This is America, so order in English?"" Oh Geno- what would your grandmother have said about that when she first landed in America? English isn't our national language, it's a ""Lingua Franca."" Look it up. Went to Pat's. Really enjoyed ourselves, wasn't nearly as trashy."
7692,9,1,1,1/16/2011,"I speak perfect English and not only will I not order in English here, I won't order at all. Pat's across the street delivers steak sandwiches fine without accompany xenophobia. Very few Americans have ancestors who could have ordered at Geno's without discrimination along ""wit"" it."
7693,9,2,1,1/15/2011,"With all the hype I was let down. The steak sub was good it wasn't great. It was not very hot and the fries were Like Costco fries. All the celebs must get a different sub. I will try Pats across street next time and see, This is definitely a TOURIST TRAP Ironic though their core business are tourists yet they treat them like crap if you don't know the Cheese Steak slang on how to order. Newsflash there is a big world that starts 10 ft away from the restaurant"
7694,9,1,1,1/15/2011,"Like everyone else says, no one from Philly actually consistently goes here. it's a tourist spot. The only time it's acceptable to go when you're actually from Philly is at 2am when you're drunk. The people are rude and the cheesesteaks are wayyy over priced. And btw not everyone from Philly talks like an idiot and doesn't know how to pronounce their ""h"" in with. The few times I've gone I make sure to accentuate the h when I've ordered...it always pissed them off. And like you've been reading, they're racist and have no issues telling the world that and their stances on political subjects with all the signs and posters they have up the most popular being ""this is america order in english"". Like honestly get over yourself Bill O'Riley ˜the world doesn't care what your stance is on the country's immigration policies...stick to what you're good at which is selling over priced mediocre cheesesteaks. Douchebags."
7695,9,1,1,1/14/2011,"Only cheese steak place I dislike more than Pat is Geno's. For it being a tourist hot spot in philly they're very rude and not flexible with people ordering withing their ""system"". All for not too...the cheese steak was dry and lacked basically anything that makes a cheese steak a cheese steak. Stay clear if you can. Over priced Rude No bang for you buck Three strikes you're out."
7696,9,1,1,1/12/2011,"Barely better than Pat's in my opinion. Bread was actually warm. Meat was tender enough and flavor was ok, and I went with the cheesewhiz. And well cheesewhiz is... cheesewhiz. Fake, melted, way too salty cheese-like sauce. Not what my dreams and expectations of what a true Philadelphia cheesesteak would taste like. But still, between my beau and I, in our mini cheesesteak throwndown, Geno's was better overall. However, the criteria for winning this mini throwdown was basically deciding which is less crappy. And holy crap, what a bigot the owner is (presumably, Geno). He had stickers/signs/posters posted saying great things like, ""You're in AMERICA, order in ENGLISH"", along with other pretty obvious stabs at Latino immigrants, including a border control picture depicting Mexican immigrants as chihuahuas. I'm assuming that his background is of Italian descent, so to be oblivious enough to ignore how your family came from another country to find their ""American Dream"" and bash how Latinos are doing it today is just downright ignorant. Best part? This past year he won some kind of ""Best Tea Party Member"" award. Should have ordered in Spanish. So obviously, I'm never going there again."
7697,9,2,1,1/11/2011,"One of the most shittiest and overrated piece of cheesesteak ever! ˜I have been living in Philly since 2005 and had Geno's twice and it was not tasty at all. ˜The way that they cut their meat slices (long strips) make the sandwich taste dry. ˜Pat's Cheesesteaks' approach to their meat is loose and cut up. ˜Their meat is moist and juicy as well. ˜Not only that, their neon signs are TRULY OBNOXIOUS! ˜It made feel like is this the Las Vegas of Cheesesteaks? ˜Visually yes but clearly NOT! ˜Do yourself a favor, try it once at Geno's for the experience, but Pat's Cheesesteaks is better. ˜However, I think that there are better cheesesteak joints in the city than those two. ˜For example: Jim Steak's on South is my fav. ˜Two nights ago, I took my cousin from NYC to Geno's and the verdict between Pat's and Geno's: Pat's although both overrated said he. ˜I do remember specifically when I had Geno's the second time, it caused traumatic diarrhea..... ˜well not traumatic but damn sure it fu$%ed my morning up the next day. ˜Geno's will not take another cent OUTTA me!"
7698,9,3,1,1/10/2011,Average product but a city landmark. Go for the experience but better steaks can be had elsewhere.
7699,9,2,1,1/8/2011,"Since moving to Philly a few months ago, I had been avoiding going to either Pat's or Geno's due to the depressing reviews. But when our friend came to visit from overseas, I felt obligated to take her on her last night in town. Poor girl had never had a cheesesteak before. Yeah. Anyway, I forgot which one was the bigot, Pat or Geno, so we just rocked up to Geno's because Pat's had a bit of a line and Geno's had none. At the time it made perfect sense. I was going to tell my boyfriend how to order, but decided against it when I realized I didn't care. After ordering at the window, the gruff lady behind the counter translated it as ""Wit Wiz"" to no one in particular. A few minutes later another gruff lady slid open another window, thrust our cheesesteak out, slid the window shut. Boyfriend waved at her to get a drink and got one filled about 2/3 of the way with ice, which you know was exactly what we wanted for standing around in 30 F (before windchill) weather. The cheesesteak ($7.50? Really?) was utter garbage, and this from someone who's only had a cheesesteak twice before: once from the cart in front of the Liberty Bell Center, and another from some random fast food joint in California the week I found out we were moving to Philly. It's been almost a full 24 hours since I ate the thing (because after taking a few bites neither the boyfriend nor our visiting friend wanted anything to do with it, and I hate to waste food, or in this case, ""food""), and I still feel the bread and cheese pressing down on my appendix. Half way through abandoning me to my last meal on earth, the assholes decided they wanted to try Pat's instead. I was like, sure, if you help me finish this we can get a cheesesteak from Pat's. My friend rolled her eyes, the boyfriend hailed a cab, and that was the end of that."
7700,9,1,1,1/7/2011,"Here's the deal. On a recent vacation to Philladelphia I thought to myself ""I'm in Philly, clearly a cheesteak is in order"". After the show on Food Network I knew exactly where to go... that crazy corner where both places have those great sammy's. Ugh. I was surprised when i noticed that Geno's ˜boasts signs like ""If you can't speak English get out of line"" and insane racial propaganda that is honestly ignorant. After talking to some locals it turns out that these guys are some seriously racist dudes who feel like it's okay to spew their hate talk like it's no big deal. I got out of line. Not spending a penny here. It's not okay and in most of the country these hate mongers would get run out of business. I got a great cheesesteak down on South Street by some rasta dudes who were AWESOME. Suck it GENOS!!"
7701,9,2,1,1/6/2011,"Also totally ok. ˜Bland, but better bread than Pat King's unless you like soggy bread."
7702,9,5,1,1/4/2011,"Geno's is the best! ˜WAY better than Pat's. ˜And the people that work there are really nice too. ˜It's the best with prov, onions, a tad of hot sauce, and ketchup & mustard. ˜ Yum!"
7703,9,3,1,1/4/2011,"I would like to give it 3.5 stars, but I'm not able. It's not up to the 4-star label, though. You cannot come here without comparing it to its neighbor, Pat's. I seem to be in the minority in thinking that Geno's is a little better. The meat is less gristly than Pat's, and sliced thinner. They are both different styles, and Geno's just agrees with me more. Not great meat, though, at any rate. The process for ordering is smoother than at Pat's, as long as you order in English."
7704,9,3,1,1/3/2011,"Geno's is more of a tourist attraction than anything. The bright neon lights attracts people like flies to the fluorescent zappers. Both have the same effect...a timely journey to your death! Hahaha. There's not too much special about the actual food, but I guess the environment is almost as important too. The beef is average, the bread is okay, and the cheese...well cheese is cheese. If you're looking for a little Philly style rough-up, the hot sauce will do you justice, especially on its way out a couple hours later. It's kinda like a bittersweet relationship, the hot sauce and I. I'll spare you the details. Verdict: A cheesesteak is a cheesesteak, and it's definitely a must try if visiting Philadelphia. But I must say that there's better cuisine out there."
7705,9,1,1,1/3/2011,"I think they are both over-rated but Pat's was my clear choice, although I liked the fries and pictures in front of Geno's. ˜Even though I give a low rating, this is a must see and this Texan tourist still enjoyed the taste test."
7706,9,5,1,12/31/2010,sup with the bad reviews 2nd best steak in philly under jims
7707,9,3,1,12/29/2010,"Alright, alright. Pats v. Genos. Sorry, my win is Pats. However, the guys at Genos aren't total dicks like they are at Pats. I get that a lot of people are offended by their political banners and their pro-republican stance. Yeah, we're in a world run by liberal hippies. But you hippies forget something, our 1st amendment right. These guys use it. As a Libertarian, I'm glad these guys are using their restaurant to say they're proud to be Americans, even if they're significantly more to the right to where I am politically. The beauty of our country is the freedom of expression, at least for now, before you damn hippies destroy that. So, good for them. I may not believe everything they do, but I'm happy they're excersizing their rights as Americans. Back to the point --- Yeah, their steaks are a little thick for me, not as tender as I'd like but hey, they're good. They're not fucking terrible or anything. Not the best, not the worst. They're okay. If you want the best, go to Tony Luke's. But it's fun just to experience the feud between Pat's and Geno's. But shh, you'll probably like Pat's better."
7708,9,4,1,12/29/2010,"My boyfriend and I were in Philly for the day and decided we wanted to wanted to try some real Philly cheesesteaks. We live in San Francisco and heard about the rivalry, so decided we needed to try both Geno's and Pat's. ˜Short answer, Geno's was better. Geno's was all around the more flavorful cheesesteak. ˜The bread tasted fresher, the steak was more flavorful and so was the wiz.... ˜However, I didn't appreciate the awkward pro america (borderline racist) paraphernalia - I would actually refrain from bringing people here because of it. ˜The building is..interesting, I didn't mind the orange paint but the sign with flames is gaudy. ˜I would rate the food at 3.5, but the experience they provide made me round their score up to a 4. ˜ Bottom line: ˜Tasted better than Pat's, fun experience, good cheesesteak. ˜I can get an equally good, if not better tasting cheesesteak at home in California so if you don't like Geno's cheesesteak it's not the end of the world, it's more about the experience."
7709,9,3,1,12/28/2010,"Don't let the flashy lights fool you. I'd heard about Geno's because of The Food Network so the weekend I moved to the Philly area from Southern California, I took my mom and my aunt here. First off, what's with the ethnocentric and xenophobic remarks about America and such Geno's has plastered everywhere? I felt awkward standing in line looking at all of that stuff, and I'm not a minority. As for the service, meh. It's like any other cheesesteak place, rude yet quick and efficient. The cheesesteak's were unremarkable. Tony Luke's has far better cheesesteak's for about the same price."
7710,9,1,1,12/27/2010,We usually go to Pat's across the street!
7711,9,3,1,12/26/2010,"When you come to the intersection of Passyunk and 9th, you look at one side and you see bright colorful lights...enticing you to come over to try their ""World Famous Cheesesteaks."" Then you look to the other side and you see a old building that isn't as flashy, but they promise the same thing. Sure lots of people like Geno's. ˜And lot's of people like Pat's. ˜I don't think you'll get a consensus from Philadelphians. ˜But that's what makes our country great. ˜You have a choice. ˜Pick one or the other. ˜It doesn't matter, as long as it makes you happy. I like Geno's bread. ˜But Pat's steak is better."
7712,9,3,1,12/24/2010,"My husband never had a cheesesteak in the City of Brotherly Love and I think one of your exposures should be the eternal Pat's vs Geno's feud (otherwise, you will always wonder what the fuss is all about). ˜And yes, I still wonder what all the fuss is all about. ˜I used to live in Philly and only need to eat a cheesesteak once a year to have my fix. ˜For me, Geno's edges ahead of Pat's but still lags behind Tony Luke's. I'll compare Pat's vs Geno's. ˜At both places, we bought it Wit Whiz. ˜The bun at Pat's is a little fluffier and less dense than at Pat's. ˜They're also a little more generous on the meat portions. ˜I don't know why people complain that it's dry but I actually found my steak to be rather messy...it was dripping with a mixture of meat juices and whiz. ˜The bun soaked up a lot, which made it nice and moist. ˜I thought the meat was more tender and flavourful than the meat at Geno's. ˜Either way, it's a decent steak sandwich. No, it won't knock your socks off and I certainly wouldn't ever go out of your way to come here but if you happen to be in Philly, this makes a decent, entertaining lunch."
7713,9,3,1,12/24/2010,"Pat's vs Geno's is one of the great debates in Philadelphia. Geno's makes a very good cheesesteak, unfortunately they are right across the street from Pat's who, in my opinion, makes them better. Geno's uses a thicker piece of meat for their sandwiches, where Pat's chops the meat more finely. For me it's a good, not great cheesesteak."
7714,9,2,1,12/21/2010,"You want to talk cheesesteaks? ˜You gotta go to both Pat's and Geno's... so that when you tell your friends about Steve's Prince of Steaks, you can definitively say ""Eh, yo. I know my cheesesteaks, aight? ˜And Pat's ain't it. ˜Geno's ain't it either. ˜Steve's is where it's at."""
7715,9,2,1,12/21/2010,"Sometimes I like to take friends and family who have never been and get one from Pat's and one from here and see which they like best. It's fun, just don't forget and take a steak over to the other area, you'll get boo'd out of the place!"
7716,9,2,1,12/18/2010,"(1) The flashy lights were about the only thing that was remotely interesting. (2) Racism...everywhere...REALLY!? wow... (3) After hearing about how AMAZING the steaks are supposed to be; I was incredibly disappointed by how BLAH the sandwhich tasted. So, if you like crappy food & Good 'ol fashioned racism...you won't be disappointed!"
7717,9,2,1,12/17/2010,"PAT'S vs. geno's I was sooo excited to FINALLY be in Philly for the first time because I wanted to try the Cheese Steaks. Being that I was only out there for 1 night I had to get one from each of the most well known spots, so that I could do the compare and contrast between the two. I had heard so many times that Geno's was great and how many celebs go there and blah blah blah...and all I can say is FAIL!!!!!! The sandwich was dry, the meat had no flavor and the onions were so raw that I had that annoying onion taste in my mouth for a while until I got back to the hotel and brushed my teeth...UGHHH...DON'T WASTE UR MONEY HERE...I've tasted better in NYC...don't be fooled by the celeb hype and the BRIGHT lights... Then, I quickly made my way across the street. I order one from Pat's and I could tell just by watching them make it that it as going to taste WAY BETTER. The Bread was soft, the steak chopped up and JUICY, the onions and peppers COOKED and the cheese was regular American cheese, but good non the less... LADIES AND GENTS WE HAVE A WINNER...PAT'S HANDS DOWN..."
7718,9,2,1,12/16/2010,"All my life, I've heard people telling me that you can't get a Philly cheese steak to taste right unless it's made in Philly. ˜And when I asked, they told me that this was the place to go for it. ˜I have to say that I wasn't thrilled. ˜I was expecting to be knocked over by how different the steak was from every other sports bar that claims to have one, and I was not. ˜That being said, Pat's crew across the street were much more pleasant than the crew at Geno's. ˜My group and I decided to split up and try a sandwich from each place. ˜I walked back from Pat's, sandwich in hand, and went to sit down with them (I stopped for a napkin on the way) only to be yelled at for taking a napkin. ˜I figured they were mad because I wasn't a paying customer, so I offered to buy some fries. ˜The guy looked at me and yelled, ""No! ˜You got a bad sandwich!"" I had heard the competition between these two was tight, but I wasn't aware that their principle strategy for gaining market share involved alienating potential customers. ˜I met my group in the ""neutral ground,"" and I gotta say, not much difference between Pat's & Genos, flavor-wise, but as far as kindness goes, Pat's wins."
7719,9,1,1,12/16/2010,"I just realized that I missed a big point of Geno's hatred: the lights. That godawful, garish nightmare of a building. A structure that makes the Vegas strip look like the model of taste and restraint. Remember that sleazy, alternate Hill Valley in Back to the Future II? It's just like that. Vento is Biff, and Geno's is Biff Tannen's Pleasure Paradise."
7720,9,1,1,12/14/2010,The cheesesteaks here are terrible.
7721,9,4,1,12/14/2010,"We enjoy visiting restaurants that we have seen on the Travel Chanel, which is how we found Geno's and Pat' Steaks. Flew in to Philly on our way to Atlantic City & stopped in for a taste of Philly!!! Enjoyed the food at both places but have to give the thumbs up to Pat's for their helpful & friendly service. ˜ Barb P. San Diego"
7722,9,4,1,12/12/2010,"I tried both Pat's and Geno's on the same night just to keep the taste test fair. ˜Geno's was better, IMO. ˜The meat was more flavorful. ˜That was the major difference. ˜They were both good but Geno's was just a bit better."
7723,9,4,1,12/12/2010,"What's with the bad reviews? I thought the cheesesteaks were delicious! I never got to try Pat's across the street, but I still think it was a good sandwich. Melty cheese, over meat, along with veggies on toasty bread. The food came out fast, the pictures on the wall were interesting, and it was entertaining watching them make your food."
7724,9,3,1,12/9/2010,"I went for the provolone and cheesesteak with onions, which was very tasty, but then I made the mistake of putting hot sauce on it. I really enjoy hot sauce, but this one is ridiculously hot! I couldn't taste the cheesesteak after that, so if you're going to go in for the hot sauce, just be careful, I usually put hot sauce on everything, but I really don't enjoy it when I can't taste a thing."
7725,9,1,1,12/8/2010,"I will stand by my statement that Genos is only famous or even in business from setting up shop across the street from Pat's. Geno's makes a horrible cheesesteak. There are chunks of grizzle around the outline of the meat, which is very bland and not chopped. Gross. If you are looking for a really good Philly cheesesteak, you'd be better off going without one than ruining your experience by coming here!"
7726,9,1,1,12/8/2010,"My boo and I came here on our journey from NY to Philly. The cheesesteaks here were meh. ˜I've had better ones elsewhere. ˜The meat is pretty bland. These two restaurants are like a couple of assholes in a pissing match. ˜We bought food from Pat's across the street and came here because we wanted to try them both. ˜Immediately they'd shoo us away. Keep in mind that all of the picnic tables are empty, and we bought food from them. We decided that they both suck and Cheesesteaks in Philly aren't good. ˜But if you're dead set on getting a cheesesteak, head over to Jim's where the meat is actually somewhat seasoned and the workers are nice and friendly. Probably the first and last time we'll be in Philly. ˜Surprisingly, New Yorkers are friendlier!"
7727,9,2,1,12/6/2010,"After trying Pat's, I walked across the street to try out Geno's. Pat's had delicious, flavorful toppings, but plain meat. I ordered a cheesesteak ""whiz wit"". The cheese and the grilled onions did not look as appetizing from Pat's, BUT!!! the meat was moist, not over-cooked and loaded with flavor! The meat wasn't chewy like Pat's, which is two thumbs up from me! Yet, the cheese and the grilled onions were a disappoint. They didn't add anything else to the sandwich. No extra POP. The bread wasn't toasted =( so it added the ""heaviness"" to the sandwich."
7728,9,3,1,12/6/2010,"having been to pats, and not even enjoying it when i was DRUNK at 4 am (houston, we have a problem), i was quite happy that i enjoyed geno's, sober, at 4 pm. oh and hi, cheese fries (soooo good). i know it's a touristy thing, but i'd probably go back."
7729,9,2,1,12/5/2010,So being that neither of us had ever been to Philly and everyone said go to Geno's and get a cheese steak we felt it to be an important stop on our whirlwind tour of Philly. Since we where short on time and needed to get to the ballpark for a tour ˜this cheese steak was more like our breakfast. We where the only people there on a random Tuesday morning. So we had a cheesesteak with all the fixings and well I was pretty disappointed. It was one of the priciest cheesesteaks I ever ate ( which I expected being a tourist destination). It was not any better then a steak and cheese sub I grew up on living in Lyman Maine. Maybe my expectations where too high but I was disappointed because I did not see anything special about this Philly cheese steak.
7730,9,1,1,11/29/2010,"Avoid! Taste: Bland. ˜Bread was great. But that was all. Experience: Very put off by the ""speak english"" sign and various other bits of signage. The 30 minute wait in line wasn't fun either. Haven't tried Pat's yet but probably won't bother. Next time in Philly will opt for a cheese steak place with great yelp reviews for the actual taste of the food."
7731,9,5,1,11/28/2010,"I would drive to Philly just to come here. I've tried Pat's and honestly they taste pretty much the same in my opinion. But Geno's is juicier and has whole slices of steak. Wiz With is the only way to go. Cheese fries are also awesome. It is a little pricey but quality costs money. Cash only! I hated steak before this place, now i crave it constantly. Don't listen to the bad reviews. its nonsense."
7732,9,1,1,11/23/2010,"the cheesesteaks here are SO BLAND! the meat is dry and tastes like cardboard. to think, i allowed myself to eat meat on this trip just to try phiily cheesesteaks and it turned out i've had better cheesesteaks in OAKLAND. and the best part of the places i've eaten in the bay, there isn't a racist sign telling me what language i need to speak in order to get service. screw you geno ownership. you should spend more time learning to make better cheesesteaks instead of trying to control what language gets spoken in your restaurant. the next time i come here, if i ever want to waste my time again, i'll bring my entire loud @$$ vietnamese speaking family just to piss you off. ignorant douchebags. take down that GD sign or get the hell out of america if you can't handle all the different languages spoken in this country!"
7733,9,1,1,11/21/2010,"Totally NOT the best cheese steak sandwich in Philly. If this is what Philly calls the best, then well...I feel sorry for people here, for I've had a better cheese steak sandwich from Charley's at any military base. The attitude of employees was horrible! They did have a sticker saying you are in america, order in English or something like that. Well I don't know what wiz or wit is. I know what ""wit"" is but I'm sure that's not what you use to describe a sandwich. I don't care if you support law enforcement or u.s. military. I am in the Army and I felt not only ripped off for the amount of meat they put in the sandwich but also abused for their rude attitude. I'm sorry, I don't know what wit or wiz or whatever it is. I'm not from South Philly. I'm from Boston and we treat Yankees fans better than they treated me or my friend there. And cash only? Serious? This is 2010. Get with the program. I'm going to try Tony Luke's tomorrow. Hopefully it's alot better than this place. No wonder why Pats had a longer line."
7734,9,1,1,11/17/2010,"Owned and operated by South Philly trash and lit up like a shitty traveling carnival attraction, going to Geno's is through-and-through a bad experience. The way the employees seem to resent their customers for bothering them by patronizing their establishment, and especially ˜the obese man/woman character who slices the bread for the sandwiches complete the carnie vibe. I'd give the food a C-, and definitely not worth the $9 or whatever it is they charge now. For my two cents, it is better than Pat's, whose meat I find to be dry and undigestible. To be sure, you will get a better steak from ANY other sandwich shop in Philly (besides Pat's) or any other city for that matter. There is something humbling about going to Geno's. Usually when I'm there it's at an hour when most decent people are asleep (Geno's is open 24hrs). You get into a long line with money in hand, for fear of not being prepared to get out of the cashier's sight the moment they shove your overpriced pile of meat in your hand. Then there's the ridiculous streamlined ordering system (the ""wiz wit or witout"" shit) which I suppose originated naturally by regulars, but now feels contrived because it is mandatory. I want to gag sometimes when I hear myself say it. You slink off, happy to be out of eye-shot of the miserable people making sandwiches inside. Then there's Mr. Geno's steaks himself, Joey Vento. A real-life Jed Clampett, Mr. Vento comes off as a lovable lug who made it big. He seems like a nice guy, aside from his divisive political views which he has no qualms about sharing. That doesn't bother me. I imagine that if Jed Clampett went on a racist tirade about terrorists and Middle Eastern Oil, he'd be forgiven on the grounds of being a rich, overindulged rube, too. Yet another aspect of Geno's that is in bad taste is the police and firefighter theme. Being a person who hates cops, and ESPECIALLY over-the-top, tasteless pandering, this really gets me. There is a giant plaque of Daniel Faulkner's surly mug (cop who was allegedly killed by Mumia Abu Jamal 30 years ago) right out front. As if this wasn't enough to dissuade anyone from going to Geno's, consider the case of the gentleman who was beaten up by Geno's goons after discovering meat delivered surreptitiously in the middle of the night was labeled as coming from some South American country from a year previous. Granted, he got beaten up for keying Geno's Hummer, but he discovered year old meat from a different continent all the same. Go America"
7735,9,1,1,11/13/2010,"Gross. Low-quality meat smelled like dog-food. Cheese Wiz was watery. It is a sad state of a sandwich when the only nice thing you can say is, ""Sweet onions."" And the anti-immigrant sentiment is disgusting. Last I checked you are a third or fourth generation Italian, Geno or Mr. Vento. Were your relatives fluent English speakers when they stepped off of the boat?"
7736,9,2,1,11/13/2010,The atmosphere and tradition are the reasons for the two stars. ˜ I was not very impressed with the actual food. ˜ Seems like there was too much bread and not enough meat on the sandwich. ˜ Will try Pat's across the street next time.
7737,9,4,1,11/11/2010,"Haven't been over to pats yet, and I'm no expert of philly cheese steak but this is one of the best sandwiches I've had. ˜The bread was great, the steak was great and I love white american cheese so the sandwich was great. Second thing I like about Geno's is one of the few corners of America where its ok to be an american, and not feel sorry about it. ˜American pride is something that is all over this place and its something that I enjoy about eating here. ˜The Law Enforcement/Fire Dept memorial as you walk up to all the pics and the different decor just adds to it for me. ˜I'm not into the whole competition between the two I just know that so far, Pat had got his work cut out for him"
7738,9,2,1,11/10/2010,"stop #2 in the wiz wit off (pat's/geno's/jim's): geno's placed higher than pat's simply because of the quality of the meat and the wiz-to-meat ratio. ˜however, still not digging this sandwich because they don't chop the meat, there wasn't enough of it (chopped or not), and the onions were underdone - almost raw, in fact."
7739,9,1,1,11/4/2010,"OVERRATED OVERPRICED JUST NOT THAT GOOD. This place is so hyped, I was expecting something at least decent. I've eaten at Jim's (which was EXCELLENT btw) and was expecting this place to be as good, or better. Wow was I mistaking. I will be fair, the one and ONLY good thing that was worth mentioning, the steak was of good quality and fairly tender, BUT it was not cut thin enough. Cheese whiz is cheese whiz, but they did not put enough on it. The onions were diced a bit too small, and not cooked enough. The bread wasn't bad, but wasn't that good either, tasted like something you'd be in a supermarkets bread aisle (do not mistake this comment for a supermarkets fresh bakery) The cheesesteaks are $8.50, I wouldn't have said it was overpriced if it was good, but it was not! There is only outdoor seating, outdoor ordering, outdoor eating, does not have an inside! It's the type of building that should be on a boardwalk, not in the middle a northest metro area! They do not offer mayo with the condiments. The hot sauce that they offer is insanely hot, too hot for a cheesesteak IMO, and this is the only hot sauce they have.... I've made better cheesesteaks at home. Have had many many better steaks in NYC/Jersey City/Hoboken. Genos is, Nowhere, and I mean NOWHERE, near the quality of the sandwich Jim's makes. If this place is better than Pat's, I'd hate to taste Pat's! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS. GO TO JIMS ON SOUTH STREET!!!!!!!! I don't even write reviews often, if at all, however I read so many GOOD reviews about this place, I had to write this so hopefully more people will know what it is really like."
7740,9,5,1,11/3/2010,I went to Philly for a conference and all the taxi drivers were saying I had to try Pat's or Geno's cheesesteak. Went there after the conference and it was one of the best cheesesteak i've ever had. The pepper there is spicy too.. One of the 2 places you gotta eat at when your in Philly.
7741,9,2,1,11/3/2010,"worse than Pats. ˜ is having said ""been there done that"" really worth a crappy overpriced sandwich when there are so many better options in this city? ˜i dunno. good things: ˜cheese fries and hours bad things: ˜pretty much everything else"
7742,9,2,1,11/1/2010,"I ate a Geno's Cheesesteak SOBER! HELP! Warning - Geno's and Pat's Cheeseteaks are not meant to be enjoyed sober. To fully enjoy this experience it is suggested that you should be too intoxicated to drive. Please only eat these Cheesesteaks DRUNK, or else... Alright, so yes...sadly these two establishments are probably the most popular of Philadelphia Tourists and D-Bags but they are not awful. I actually somewhat did enjoy my Geno's Steak.. I thought the meat was better than Pat's (that's a plus..I guess?). Would I stop by here again? Yes..but ONLY when Tony Lukes is closed haha. Geno's is by far not the best cheesesteak I have ever had and I don't feel like they represent a ""True Philadelphia Cheesesteak"", but they did satisfy my 3am Cheesesteak fix on a Sunday Night. Food is Food sometimes after 1am... I would never come here in daylight! ;-)"
7743,9,5,1,10/31/2010,"I am giving this place a 5 simply because i think that their cheesesteak is better then Pat's, and right now Pat's is way ahead in the rankings. The only other thing these two joints got going for it is that they stay open later like as late as 3am and Geno's has Birch Root Beer. Other then that i would avoid going to these places at all cost. Their attitudes use to be funny back when they were charging $6-7 for a plain cheese steak but now that it is $7-9 neither of these places are worth it. The only reason to go here is because the only other option is WaWa or some dingy diner, so compared to the late night competition it gets 5 stars from me."
7744,9,2,1,10/31/2010,"Oh stop it with the ""tourist"" stuff - the line following a Flyers or Sixers game is not all tourists!! ˜ ˜and BTW Philly is not Paris, so please... ˜ ...that said, I would go here only if you're going to the Italian Market and there's no or a short line. The steak is decent - the roll is decent. ˜The main difference between Genos and Pats is that Pats seems to put the cheese on the outside where Genos puts it on the roll; therefore Genos is less messy. They do not suck, but there are better for sure."
7745,9,1,1,10/30/2010,"So much fun. Last night I went for some cheese fries. I am diabetic and my sugar was low. The kid behind me kept elbowing me in the back. I asked him to stop. He and his two friends started screaming at me and pushing me. I get to the window and the guy tells me to get lost, we ain't serving you. Well let me just say, F**K OFF, Geno's. What a joke. And the food ˜is awful as well."
7746,9,5,1,10/28/2010,"I personally live Pat's more, only because it seems more original to me and the way the meat is prepared.. But other than that. They are very close and I would say damn near identical in flavor.. I am giving this 5 stars as well, but Pats is my top choice.. A chain called ""Phillys best"" also rivals these 2 joints..."
7747,9,2,1,10/28/2010,OVER_RATED ....... OVER_RATED.....(chant it with me) Next time I'm in Philly I'm going to try some of the local spots..this place is for tourists....cheese fries were money though
7748,9,3,1,10/27/2010,"I will add my two cents to the Genos vs. Pats debate. ˜I was in Philly for a week at a conference. ˜One night we did Pats, one night we did Genos. ˜I'm going to vote slightly in favor of Pats. ˜ Genos was friendlier, appeared cleaner, and has more glitz. ˜I had a cheese steak with provy, onions and sweet peppers. ˜The onions and the peppers were cooked just right. ˜Pat's peppers and onions were overdone and soggy. ˜Pats seemed to put more meat on the bun. ˜Also, I liked Pat's bread better. ˜ I'm sure there are better cheese steaks in Philly, but these are the most famous. ˜Now I can say that I have been there and done that."
7749,9,1,1,10/27/2010,"Cheese steaks, eh. ok Over abundance of patriotism, eh. ok. Having a sign that says ""when ordering Speak english, this is America""...ignorant. Waiting in a long line, for what turned out to be mediocre food, in an establishment that probably makes tons of money- I wont be back"
7750,9,2,1,10/26/2010,Love their cheese fries but their steaks send me straight to the bathroom.... TMI but true lol... Dont forget you must order in English at Geno's haha
7751,9,3,1,10/25/2010,"its was aight, there's a place in cali that I like better. But at least I can say I at there"
7752,9,2,1,10/25/2010,"Geno's is better than Pats, but in all honesty these cheesesteaks aren't that awesome. ˜Bland meat, low quality bread, and processed cheese. Meh."
7753,9,3,1,10/19/2010,"Driving back to NYC from DC we decided to stop in Philly for my first authentic cheesesteak. I was stuck in the middle of Pat's and Geno's trying to decide which one to devour and decided to try both, in order to make a decision on which one I'll give the winning ribbon to. First of all I was amazed with the line ride at Pat's and was worried that no lines at Geno's meant that his cheesesteak was terrible. Despite this fact, I walked over to Geno's ordered my steak, plonked myself on a bench and after a few bites, ˜couldn't fathom that I just paid close to 8 bucks for this mediocre sandwich. In Geno's defense, the quality of meat deserves an A+ and I didn't leave there worrying about my cholesterol skyrocketing from too much oil. I was expecting to be wowed by this supposedly world renowned sandwich, but after having my first, I can do without another. Also instead of that whiz cheese crap, I'd wish they'd offer gravy, coz a roast beef sandwich with gravy back in Oz is the only way to go! I still had to decide on which one was better, so we walked over to Pat's and after I felt my blood turning to oil, the winner goes to Geno's."

7755,9,1,1,10/18/2010,"After hearing about this place on the food channel network, this place definitely falls short. For starters the customer service was terrible. The, lady was VERY racist. She pretty much just through my food at me. Now onto the horrible food. This was the absolute WORST cheese steak I have ever had. ˜The bread tasted like plastic. The chesse was even worse. Got very rubbery. The steak didn't even taste like steak. I live in DC, and the carryouts are 10 times better. There was no taste to the cheesesteak whatsoever. The onions definitely were not cooked. Tasted like they just cut them up and through them on your sandwich. Picture they have up is very deceiving. For $8.50, please don't waste your money. ˜I will NEVER, EVER go back."
7756,9,2,1,10/18/2010,"Not much to say except this place is a tourist trap. ˜And go here after a night out, and you are bound to see people driving by and throwing up out the window. ˜Cheesesteaks are average at best, and unless you are going just to say you have been there, I would recommend finding an alternative. ˜Geno's does have decent cheese fries, and the line does move quickly."
7757,9,1,1,10/16/2010,"Let me be clear: I didn't even bother going to Gino's because as a San Francisco foodie, I know good food instinctively and so it was straight to Pat's when I visited PA on business from the Bay Area earlier this year. I was horrified when, on a whim, I visited Gino's website, and front and center is the Jeresy Shore'd out J.V. pointing to a 'This is America, Order in English,' sign, right next to a 'Carl Paladino.' Endorsement. Now, I try not to over politicize my eating experiences (which, arguably is impossible, now that I think of it), however ; apparently this place not only has bad steaks (just read the other reviews), but poorly informed politics. Doesn't this guy understand that his relatives were (at one time, maybe not for long, no matter), persecuted as the same type of 'protected class,' that he would seek to discriminate against as they are attempting to order with the best English that they can, or in any language, or gesture for that matter. This dude should be happy that he is making money in a bare market that the last president (who doubtless he voted for), created! So go on over to Gino's for a dry ass steak, unless you are intellegent, reasoning, have ancestors that weren't (ever) born in America, or are gay, or don't like 'Tea' or 'Parties,' much anymore!"
7758,9,3,1,10/16/2010,"[Pt 1 of 2] As it was my first visit to Philly this summer, how could I not try Pat's & Geno's? ˜I know it's a tourist trap but what about the idiots in line that came all the way from SC claiming they travel 8+hrs just for these cheesesteaks. ˜When you're waiting in line for 15+ mins you start chatting with the other sheeples. ˜ A bit healthier than it's rival across the street. ˜They cook their rib eye slices over the flat top grill w/o all the fat. ˜This makes their sandwiches look thinner and maybe less appealing, but it tastes less greasy & fatty to me. ˜It's a 1-2 napkin meal to eat. I prefer Geno's. ˜5 out of 5 people in my little road trip agreed. ˜ The fries from Geno's were ok, nothing to rave about. ˜ I got it with the provolone cheese & onions. ˜Just like Food Feuds with Chef Michael Symon from the Food Network. ˜Even though Geno's didn't win, I recommend giving them a try."
7759,9,1,1,10/15/2010,"We drove up to Philadelphia for a conference and decided to take a couple of friends, who'd never been to Philly, out for a cheese steak. The amazing thing is after a long wait and curt service, we ended up with a $40 plus bill for 4 cheese steaks ( which if you piled all the meat from 4 on one roll, you'd of actually had a sandwich) and 4 sodas. Definitely, a tourist spot. You wait in a long line to have someone snap at you. Granted their menu is small, but not everyone knows the lingo. Sort of reminded me of the soup man from ""Seinfeld"". Then there's a matter of finding a place to sit and enjoy your bread, I mean cheese steak. It was fun to stand on X street and wander how cars would get through when the two lines from the competing stores merged. Don't forget they don't take plastic, but conveniently located on either street are fee charging atms. Next time, I'm taking the cousin's advice (which I received after this disappointment), and going to Jim's...aka home of the heavyweight. After Geno's, not gonna be too hard to beat."
7760,9,3,1,10/13/2010,"After viewing the Liberty Bell, Congress Hall, etc.----- Very good tasting ˜Philly cheese steak sandwich. I ordered mine with American cheese and sweet ˜grilled peppers, comes with grilled onions in the sandwich. $9. A bit on the thin side, but tasty. Short line, it just began to rain , and it was about 5pm. Tables outside only; we ate in the car. Will go to Pat's, across the street, next time."
7761,9,3,1,10/12/2010,I ordered the whiz wit and it was good. Meat was tender and juicy. Everything is in perfect proportion (except the meat). I wish they could put some more meat in there.
7762,9,3,1,10/12/2010,"Geno's meat is definitely better than Pat's, but both are good eats for any cheesesteak cravings you may have. Good enough for me to come back if convenient."
7763,9,1,1,10/10/2010,"Every city has one and Philadephia's is GENO's (and Pat's)... what i am talking about is an overrated restaurant that is riding on some old reputation that continues to suck in the tourists...without the hype, this place would have went under a long time ago. The biggest disappointment is the lack of taste. Without the cheese, i wouldn't be able to sense any taste but salt. Where is the flavor? I hear that they are choosy with their meat, but if thats the case, they surely chose wrong. The meat is dry and as its cooked whole and sliced, the meat stays dry. (pat's ain't much better but atleast they were smart enough to chop it up to make it seem less dry) I love food rivalries and i love philly cheesesteak sandwiches but these 2 places really aren't worth the hype. I know that avoiding these places as a tourist is like going to Egypt without seeing the Pyramids, but i guarantee that you will have a much better food experience if you avoid these 2 tourist traps. BAD BREAD, DRY MEAT, TASTELESS."
7764,9,2,1,10/6/2010,"In a Pat's v. Geno's showdown, Pat's wins easily. ˜ Geno's bread is better, baked well and more substantive. ˜But who goes for the bread? ˜I actually sat down and had both sandwiches in one sitting. ˜Pat's steak is superior. ˜It's juicy and flavorful, whereas Geno's is flat and dry. ˜Just warm up some roast beef and stick it on a bun. ˜It beats shelling out $8 for bland on bread at Geno's. ˜ Needless to say, my Pat's flag has been hoisted."
7765,9,1,1,10/6/2010,"Hey Geno?!?! ˜Where's the beef? ˜I can get a better cheese steak at the Chinese or Papi store on 5th and _________ (take your pick) for half the price. Leave this place for the tourists and celebrities(?). Unless you like your butt on fire the next day then hey, chow down!"
7766,9,4,1,10/6/2010,Fancy lights make it bright for everyone to see. ˜The line led out to the street which was odd. ˜I don't know why everyone wanted to get hit by all the passing cars. ˜The line went quick which was good. ˜I thought it was weird that you can't order sides and drinks when you order the philly cheesesteak. ˜That is at a different line. ˜I really like the cheesesteak whiz. ˜Very delicious. ˜Love the cheese dripping out. ˜I guess this location is the famous version on some tv shows. ˜Maybe it's because of the lights.
7767,9,3,1,10/6/2010,"i didn't have the same complaints as some of the other yelpers. ˜the meat was decent tasting and pretty moist. ˜cheese was extremely artificial, obviously, but was good. ˜it gets a 3 because it is the most famous phili cheesesteak place in the city that invented the phili cheesesteak, so i was expecting to get my socks blown off, but it did not happen. ˜this is probably one of those tourist traps that locals know to avoid."
7768,9,3,1,10/5/2010,Somehow got there with no line. Pat's was clear too. Went a little heavy on the hot sauce and couldn't taste my sandwich. Have to try again next time I'm in Phili
7769,9,3,1,10/3/2010,"First I want to start off by saying I'm very very new to the beef eating game and this was the first Philly cheese steak I've ever had so I have nothing to compare it to. My friends and I came here after partying at some lounge, and my first impression was when did I leave Philly and come to Vegas? This place was lit up like it should be on the Vegas Strip! Once we got on line it was only a 10 maybe 15 minute wait, definitely not the worst I've experienced. So while we were waiting my friend instructed me on the proper way to order because apparently if you order incorrectly you get sent to the the back of the line (that would suck). Lucky for me I ordered properly and got a whiz wit which is a steak with cheese whiz and onions. My friends cousin suggested I put some ketchup on it as well so I did and we all sat down. I took my first bite and down to the last I thought it was really good, it definitely hit the spot! My experience was different from a lot of the reviews, first being I didn't know about all the hype, I was just brought here. Secondly my bread was just fine and my meat was not dry. However I can definitely see where the place can loose its stars. I personally was very content with the food I had just eaten but I wasn't wowed by it so I can understand how someone who has bought into the hype can easily be disappointed. The wait in line wouldn't have bothered me even if it were longer only because if your out at 3 in the morning wanting to eat a cheese steak or anything else for that matter, you really have nothing better to do. However I do have to agree with it being a bit expensive for drunken food and I'm from NY. The cheese steak was $8.50 and $3.50 for fries ($4 if you want cheese) which tasted more like tater tots than fries. Overall I think the place was just fine but I am interested in some of the other places that some of these reviews say are better, the next time I'm in Philly."
7770,9,1,1,10/1/2010,"Huge disapointment. Some locals took me here to experience ""The best or at least the most famous cheese steak is South Philly"". I hope it is not the best because if it means trying anything worse I am done with the experience. As for it being most famous this is more likely as this place is lit up like a traveling carnival where you pay a ridiculous amount but still feel cheap after the experience. Geno's serves up three items: a steak sandwich with a choice of three cheeses, fries and sodas. So as specialists, one would expect something a little special. The steak is sliced, not chopped, flavorless and not seasoned. The sprinkled diced grilled onions added upon request don't add enough to the taste. If you want really bland go for the provolone, you won't notice it is there. ˜ ˜ ˜ Oddly the worst cheese ever, American, is a step up. Finally the whiz, probably not an actual cheese, provides the gooey messy textures one might expect but the combined flavors again are absent. $7+ for sandwich $4+ for small cup of cheese fries + soda = $15. to sit out side underneath a white neon canopy. While we were eating, the nearby insect zapper stayed busy and the bugs continued to meet an unsatisfying fate while I dined. ˜ I don't ever not finish my food. This once, ˜I left a quarter of my sandwich not because I was full or bloated, but instead I was bored and lost my appetite while eating. ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ If you have to go here, do not say ""please"" and/or ""thank you"" while placing your order. I was not pleased to fork out 15 bucks or thankful to have digested this bland ""comfort food."" Philly cheese steak, At least this Philly cheese steak is not a must have, must experience to appeciate the local flavor and culture type of thing... At least not this ˜cheese steak."
7771,9,2,1,9/30/2010,"I ate here once and didn't like it as much as Pat's. ˜It is definitely too gaudy for me. ˜That they don't chop up the meat here is a noble endeavor (and their saying that ""the cow is already dead"" is clever, to be sure) but this approach keeps Geno's flavors from meshing as well as his rival's. The few times I've been to Cheesesteak Row the line at Pat's is always longer. ˜It's definitely worth the wait."
7772,9,4,1,9/29/2010,"Tried both geno's and pat's. I'm a fan of geno's! Sliced meat, yummy bread and cheesewhiz."
7773,9,2,1,9/26/2010,"As you may know, Geno's is definitely the tourist hot spot. As you may not know, their cheesesteaks are supremely overrated. We had a craving for a good ol' cheesesteak and decided to grab Geno's. It has been awhile since I've eaten here (I prefer Pat's), but thought I'd try the light polluting establishment again. Whiz Wit please... the cheesesteak came out quickly and I began to devour it. It really isn't anything special. The bread was on the dull side and the meat, thickly cut, was just OK. There are a bunch of better places in Philly, like across the street, so don't fall for the trap. Fries were very poor as well. Not as crispy as I would have liked them, and they tasted a bit old. 2 stars is for attempt and was still edible."
7774,9,1,1,9/25/2010,"SUPER excited about trying a famous Geno's Philly cheesesteak. Unless their horrible cafeteria food is the definition of an iconic sandwich. Pat's right across the street was better, but still was quite atrocious. We stayed in and cooked cheesesteaks the next night."
7775,9,1,1,9/24/2010,"A long line leading to the street and crowds of people is what you will see when you approach or drive by this place. NOT worth the hype at all. Drove 3 hrs from NY to experience the ""famous"" Geno's. Overall it was VERY dry, the meat was not chopped up enough, and not enough cheese (I was expecting melting dripping out of the sandwich cheese). The onions were ok. There's ketchup, mustard, hotsauce on the side, I tried to add on to make up for the dryness, but it barely helped at all for this WEAK $8.00 sandwich. The orange painted building is attractive, but does not correspond with the food. Dont waste your time."
7776,9,1,1,9/23/2010,"There's a reason we call Philadelphia ""Murdelphia"" or ""Killadelphia"", because if you don't get shot, we'll kill you with artery clogging tourist traps such as Genos. ˜Not to mention that the service is ridiculously, almost comically, rude."
7777,9,1,1,9/21/2010,"Sorry, but everyone's right when they say they have better in other states *ahem CA.* ˜I did not get a cheesesteak here but I did in two other places and they were both bland yet pricey. ˜I wanted to hit all 3 popular cheesesteak joints so I got one from Pat's and walked over to Geno's for their cheese fries. ˜HORRIBLE. ˜It was like eating up withering, soggy fries drenched in too much cheese whiz...all for over $4! ˜Oh and, the lady in the ""cheesesteak"" line yelled at me to go over to the ""fries"" window. ˜Why do you need a whole other window just for fries? Plus, a guy yelled at my boo to leave the premises for carrying a Pat's cheesesteak (hey, we ordered cheese fries from Geno's). ˜Another guy said they didn't like Pat's (what happened to a little friendly competition?). ˜Maybe we should've taken the sign outside the eating tables seriously when it said you couldn't bring any food or drinks to that area."
7778,9,3,1,9/17/2010,"Was ok, not sure if it lived up to the hype though. ˜Was about a 45 min wait for an ok cheese steak whiz. ˜Have never tried Pats so can say who is better. ˜ Oh and good luck finding somewhere to park. Best thing was that the people we waited in line with keep buying us beer from a small bar around the corner. ˜Thanks guys."
7779,9,2,1,9/17/2010,"This place is bogus. The rolls are bad, the meat is bad, the circus lights are horrible. Take a pass on this. If you're from out of town, don't judge a cheesesteak by eating one of the monstrosities."
7780,9,4,1,9/15/2010,"This was my fourth time visiting the venerable and brightly lit Geno's in South Philly. For those visiting Philadelphia, having the ubiquitous cheese-steak is a mandatory experience. Such was the case with the group I was with last night. The people in my group weren't really a cheese-steak type of crowd, I on the other hand, love them and have at least one anytime I am in Philly. Many people have their favorite places and favorite sandwich styles. I like mine the traditional way, a ""wiz wit"". It's simple and works for me. I like Geno's alot. The food is great. The prices are reasonable. It's flashy and fun with its sparkly neon lights. It's main rival, Pat's is located against the street. Pat's decor is simple and doesn't call attention to the building. Some people prefer Pat's, some like Geno's. I like Geno's a little more, mostly because of the shiny lights. But both have great cheese-steaks. No doubt on that. Another personal favorite in town is Jim's Steak's on South Street. I like Jim's because it has indoor seating and is close to the action and excitement that is on South Street. So truthfully, I don't have a personal favorite. I like each place for different reasons. As for Geno's, I am definitely a fan."
7781,9,2,1,9/14/2010,"So if you're on that infamous corner of E.Passyunk torn between Geno's and Pat's, pick Pat's. (My personal ranking: 1.Jim's 2.Tony Luke's 3.Pat's 4.Geno's) There should only be one reason why you ever eat a cheesesteak from Geno's, and that's if you never tried it before. You deserve a slap on the hand if you ever consider eating at Geno's again. CONS: 1. The meat is not chopped up 2. There is no seasoning on the meat what-so-ever 3. The whiz is not hot enough 4. The overall taste is bland 5. The cheesesteak, as if it can get any worse, loses more and more flavor as you eat it PRO: 1. The bread is slightly softer than Pat's 2. The cheesesteak is slightly warmer than Pat's A WARNING TO ALL FIRST TIMERS: This establishment is Pro-American. My boyfriend (who by the way is Filipino-American, born and raised in Jersey just like me) heard someone at the window say to another employee, ""no no they're american"" after we ordered our food. So i wouldn't advise anyone with a foreign accent coming to this establishment. Just being a different color is a flag to them."
7782,9,1,1,9/14/2010,Don't even bother. Not worth the hype.
7783,9,2,1,9/8/2010,"Came here for an epic breakfast. ˜My BF and I decide we will split a cheesesteak from both Pat's and Geno's. ˜My verdict goes to Geno's by a slight margin. ˜The meat was more juicy at Geno's that day. ˜Plus, the hot sauce will knock your socks off! ˜Bottom line: neither places serve up good service or a killer sandwich, but it's worth a trip if you've never been."
7784,9,2,1,9/8/2010,"we checked this out immediately after grabbing a sandwich from pat's. while their wall of celebrity pics was impressive, their sandwich was less impressive. i liked the quality of their bread a little more, but the meat was drier than pat's. i wouldn't go back."
7785,9,2,1,9/7/2010,We went because its our first time in Philadelphia and heard it's one of the things to do. ˜It was ok. ˜After a long walk from the society hill stop (trolley tour) through very dubious neighborhoods we made it. ˜We chose Genos because the line was shorter. ˜Meat was not seasoned but at least it was real meat. ˜ Definitely greasy. ˜ Fries were ok. ˜There wasn't any seating left so we ate along the fence across the street. ˜Previous reviews about customer service is accurate.
7786,9,1,1,9/6/2010,The question of all questions...Pats or Genos...and the answer... THEY BOTH SUCK....
7787,9,3,1,9/3/2010,the steak is ok
7788,9,2,1,9/1/2010,"Decent cheesesteak, a little dry though for my tastes"
7789,9,1,1,8/31/2010,"Hype, Hype, Hype. This was my first trip to the land of ""Brotherly Love"". I had a mission: to get all the cheese steaks I could in a week, then make my decision who (to me) was the best of four. This over hyped place came in last. I had never heard of this place and I wish I never had. The people who recommended Geno's saw it on TV. I read some reviews, paid attention to the bad ones, and wanted to try The Tourist Trap"". My GF, her BFF and I had of all intentions of making this our first stop. We landed on Saturday morning, unpacked and headed right to the area. We were gonna do the Geno's/Pat's spit and get both, but the lines were outrageous. Pat's went around the building and Geno's was on the other block. Eh, well come later on in the week. During that time we sneaked in two places, so I did have a gauge to work of off. The next time we went, the line was considerably smaller. Pat's line was also smaller so we did the split. I go to Geno's and they go to Pat's. During this time I was told about the owner's (who is obviously of an immigrant decent) rants about being ""American"" and the importance of speaking English while ordering. I was even thinking of making up some weird accent, like Borat, to see what would happen. In my heart I wanted to have fun, but I really wanted to eat the ""cheese steak"" with out any fuss. Plus in the back of my head, I could hear my GF giving me crap for even thinking it. While in line noticed all of the Star F**ker's pictures all spread out like, well, like cheese. Pictures of ""famous"" and people I had never heard of, all of which had signatures. Who cares? Way too much Hollywood fluff going on for me. On the sidewalk was a memorial for some of the police officers who have died in the line of duty, interesting. I'm looking for the famous sticker, but not at the order window. Apparently, there are two order windows. One for the cheese steak, the other for the drinks and fries. Both counter people were rude, I have an idea why, and were very short. At the window for the cheese steak, I told the behemoth of a man, which one I wanted (Provolone), before I got my change back, the sandwich was being given to me. Interesting. Not sure if they were pre-made or just fast. Like cattle, you walk to the next window. There I had to tell the behemoth of a woman what I wanted to drink. Before I could utter a word, a guy comes from behind me and states he didn't get one of his sodas. She replies, ""You didn't get it"". This clever meeting of the minds lasted for 5 min. The witty exchange between the two ended by the man finally getting his soda. Walking away I finally notice the sticker. I really won't repeat it. I still feel nauseous thinking about the meaning and the history of signs like that. ""Whites Only"", ""No Mexicans"" so on. Armed with my ""famous"" Geno's cheese steak, a drink, and fries. I notice that grease is seeping though the bag. Are you serious?! The last two sandwiches had little to no grease. Walking to Pat's I find my BF and her buddy. They grab a seat to wait for me. Sitting there, I pull out the Geno's sandwich and my GF made her famous ""eeewwww"" face. We had to rush to Independence Hall cause we had tickets for a tour. So my GF BFF decides to drive while we sit in the back seat to sample our food. Let me put it this way; It sucked. If you decide to make public rant about your own controversial political views, you had better have the best Philly Cheese Steak in the world, the universe, to back you up. I could have gotten a better tasting sandwich at one of the Greek places in Montebello. It was bland. No flavor whatsoever. The bread was soggy from being saturated by grease. If I knew the life span on this thing was 10 minutes, we would have eaten it on the way to the car. Please, stay away from the hype. No picture wear taken. It was so shiny, it would have been like taking a pic of the sun."
7790,9,1,1,8/30/2010,"These are just awful. I honestly think the ONLY people that rave about these are the same people that visit here at 3am after they're so drunk cardboard would taste good. There are better places in NE Philly like Chinks and Jim's. If you want a good cheese steak go somewhere else, but if you'd like a Wawa alternate after 2am and taste isn't really a high priority, then go to Geno's or even Pat's. Atleast you can look at pictures of all the celebrities that tried these awful steaks too."
7791,9,2,1,8/30/2010,"Terrible, my least favorite cheesesteak ever. Even shouting ""whiz wit"" at the lady, and she gave me attitude. Everyone looked mean inside. While I'm a fan of chopped, I'll give this place a try, but it was oily and with no flavor. I think the super extreme blind patriotism kind of bothers me. They made a big deal about ""ordering only in English."" With how much they love America, isn't it weird since it's a supposed town of brotherly love, a country founded by immigrants??? Political rant aside, you're better off going the other side of the street."
7792,9,1,1,8/30/2010,"I went to Pat's earlier in the day and was talking to a local bartender later that evening. ˜He said he's glad we went to Pat's and not Geno's because they are racist. ˜Based on other reviews and the local bartenders comments, I will not be heading to Geno's ever."
7793,9,3,1,8/29/2010,"I really enjoyed the cheesesteak sandwich, but I felt uncomfortable with the atmosphere. ˜I felt like the people might be racist and later heard there were rumors to corroborate that. ˜I give them an A-OK for the actual food and not the environment. ˜I haven't tried Pat's yet and do plan to, but I hear both places are overrated and there are better places nearby (Jimmy's). ˜Either way, my profile pic is from my visit to Geno's, and I still intend to try Pat's someday."
7794,9,2,1,8/25/2010,"The only time I go to Geno's is when I take someone who has never been before. I personally prefer Pat's over Geno's and Tony Luke's over them both. I've seen Geno's and Pat's get rude with people but what do you expect you're in south Philly, for crying out load so stop whinning about it people! Just make sure you have your order right before you order! lol Philly Cheese Steaks are nothing to write home about but every so often I just have to have one. If you're ever in B-More on Baltimore Street aka ""The Block"" try a cheese steak from ""Crazy Johns""."
7795,9,1,1,8/25/2010,"I know, it's a philly institution. It's long lost its quaintness, the cheesesteaks are mediocre (wit or witout) and it's really out of the way. Trust me, cheese whiz does not make a cheesesteak great, quite the contrary."
7796,9,4,1,8/23/2010,"I like, I like. ˜Definately better than a Pat's. ˜I will get everytime I am in Philly. ˜By the way...the difference is tiny...they are both good. ˜Cheese Whiz Wit and a diet Coke."
7797,9,1,1,8/20/2010,"I came here long time ago, needless to say, it has gotten ten times worse. When I went , whole cheese steak wars, Pat's, Jim's, but I didn't care. was in high school. Someone else drove. They were Dirt-bags then..I didn't care for them much, meat wasn't chopped , & extra fatty. But now, reading some of reviews, Wow!! I also heard on the news , bout the sign, ""Order in English"" Could be more diplomatic, you do provide food & service to people??! REally..Yelp requires least one star, I wish I could give them Minus -5 star. My friend went there this past weekend, with out of towner, whom wanted Geno's. She suggested -no, how bout another one? They insisted. Mind you they went, got in line , by the time to place order, someone in back, made Racist remark & her & the friend. Not knowing what my friend does, they just ignored it, when cheese steak was ready, got the food, , she heard them again. with N*** .SO HE threw the cheesesteak at them..walked. Not good scene.WTF??!! Be forewarned-go elsewhere, NEVER here!! Too many better, places, where service & food are both great..this is not one of them!!!"
7798,9,1,1,8/20/2010,"I actually want to give no star, why people still wait in line at this overrated tourist trap when there are so many other places with way better cheesesteaks and people skills is beyond comprehension. It must be nice to make so much money that they don't give a rat's ass about customer service and the quality of their food. There is always some a-hole behind the counter with a snide racist remark. You would think the food would make up for the bad attitude but not even close! The beef is rubbery, chopped up in big uneven fatty chunks on stale chewy bread. So if you're a sucker for punishment and want to pay for something sprinkled with a lot of hate and a side of f*ck you, it's your funeral!"
7799,9,1,1,8/18/2010,"Is the cheesesteak really any different from Pat's? ˜Hm, no. ˜Is this place just downright obnoxious? ˜A definite yes."
7800,9,4,1,8/17/2010,"I love philly cheese steaks! Although, it is not the same in the west coast. This was my first time eating a real deal philly cheese steak right in Philadelphia. ˜ I ordered a philly cheese steak with cheese whiz. ˜It also comes with sauteed onions. ˜ The wait wasn't long, and my cheese steak was ready! I was so excited to try my first philly cheese steak in Philadelphia! ˜ The bread used in the philly cheese steak is crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. ˜The portion of meat is plentiful, and perfectly cooked. ˜Sauteed onions add texture and nice flavor. ˜The cheese whiz is a great compliment to the sandwich. I want to come back, maybe try the sandwiches with different cheese steaks."
7801,9,1,1,8/17/2010,"This whole ""only order in English"" thing is so outrageous that I still have a hard time believing it. I was in the area last night and stopped by and sadly it is true - this is the most ignorant joint in all Philadelphia. I came here before they permanently ridiculed themselves by proclaiming some weird radical-American patriotism and I've had better cheese fries. Also, sooo many bugs! Hated it. Anyway, support what this country really stands for by not going here."
7802,9,2,1,8/16/2010,"having seen the pat's and geno's rivalry on every food media outlet, i had to find out what all they hype was about when i visited philadelphia this past weekend. in short, the food isn't anything to get excited about. the well publicized rivalry has brought pat's and geno's more business and exposure than either restaurant's food deserves. i had the whiz cheesesteak. which in all fairness was actually pretty decent. however, it was surprisingly weaksauce in terms of amount of cheese given. i personally did not order our group's steaks, but i had the pleasure of hearing the restaurant's employees verbally abuse other customers. the racially charged stickers are a nice touch as well. 3 stars for the food. -1 star for the unwanted side of abuse/bigotry."
7803,9,2,1,8/16/2010,"I only have this to say about Geno's: Dry and tasted of racism. I felt dirty giving them my money. And the service was terrible. I suppose the job application included telling people to go f**k themselves in as many ways possible. Awful place - I almost wanted to order in Spanish just to piss them off (they have signs that basically say ""SPEAK ENGLISH OR GTFO""). Pat's wins by far."
7804,9,2,1,8/14/2010,"On a recent trip I had both Geno's and Pat's cheese steaks. ˜I had a head to head comparison. If you're in Philly why not try an iconic food spot, right? Meh. I was unimpressed. I had a Whizzer with onions. It was ok, but not what I was hoping for. Although, it's flashy and very touristy the cheese steak was mediocre. I have eaten lots of cheese steaks at various spots and this one will hold its place at the bottom of my list. If you are in the area try Big John's or Tony Luke's you will have a better cheese steak experience."
7805,9,3,1,8/13/2010,"We saw this resturant rival on the travel channel's steak paradise, so we decided to try it first before Pat's King of Steaks. It wasn't bad. There was a long line outside. ˜when we arrived. We just thought the sandwiches could of used more cheese and the beef was a little bland even though it was layered with onions. We also couldn't ˜believe just one sandwich was $8.50. Freedom fries were ordered at another window for $3.50 which seemed like a medium; theres only one size avaliable. Overall Geno's was a nice philly cheese steak just not what we expected."
7806,9,4,1,8/13/2010,"I came to Philly on a business trip and we decided to go to geno's and pat's. I tried geno's first. They were busier than pat's and looked much flashier. I waited about 5 minutes before I got my sandwich. I thought I had tasted heaven...until I walked across the street an had a Philly from pat's. Pat's sandwich is a cut above geno's but geno's is still really good. Good meat, tasty cheese whiz. The bread is a little tough for me but not overly so. So to sum it up...if you go to philly, go to geno's and have a sandwich. Then go to pat's and have another sandwich. You'll be happy you did and you'll get to pick a side in the never ending Philly cheesesteak battle."
7807,9,1,1,8/11/2010,"Seriously overrated and overpriced! If the cheese steaks at Geno's is the best that philly's got to offer, then that is the saddest story I've ever heard. The sub was sloppy, dry and tasteless. I can't believe I paid almost $8 for this? I got mine with provolone as a coworker recommended... dry. I don't really have much to say about Geno's but if you've never had it, sure go for it. At least you can say ""been there, done that""! ...but I wouldn't go back for a second time."
7808,9,3,1,8/10/2010,"This place was chaos, even at 1:30pm on a Friday. ˜I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and provolone and thought it was better than the cheesesteak I'd had at Pat's a week before - however, I suspect that it might be due to the fact that I had whiz on the Pat's one, so I will tie Geno's at 3-stars for now."
7809,9,4,1,8/6/2010,"Didn't get a chance to compare this to Pat's King of Steaks which is right down the street...but Geno's serves one great phillly cheesesteak. Almost ate the whole thing in a couple minutes without even realizing it. A little greasy but what do you expect, the overall taste and quality of it was damn good. Service was quick and simple. I'd come back and eat here, but I do want to compare it to Pat's as well."
7810,9,1,1,8/6/2010,"bad price, bad food, bad politics. ˜pleeease don't eat here if you are a tourist. ˜if you want to find a good cheesesteak place because you're in philly on holiday, ask a local for their favorite place. ˜ my suggestion? ˜street vendors! ˜they're everywhere, food is good, super cheap, and there's no nasty politicking as a side dish. ˜i typically get my street vendor cheesesteaks with egg. ˜(TRY IT!)"
7811,9,2,1,8/5/2010,"Hit this spot up yesterday with my wife and brother. I've always seen these 2 behemoth businesses but never actually swung in to get anything. We decided this time we would give Geno's a shot and then Pat's the next time we're in town. Keeping in mind, normally when I come to Philly, I always hit up Jim's on South St, I wasn't expecting the Steak-Um style on bread, which was slightly disappointing to me. It's true I probably could have made my Steak with onions and wiz at home and added more meat, but at the time I was an hour and a half away from that point. The bread was fresh, and the steak itself had decent flavor, but c'mon, for 7.50, I should not have been hungry enough to have to go to checkers down the road afterward and eaten a Buford with cheese to feel full."
7812,9,2,1,8/1/2010,"so effing expensive. so effing racist. better than pat's on taste, but....i mean, that's not saying much if your view of cheesesteaks is so myopic it just considers these two tourist-ridden ˜disasters. both places give me diarrhea."
7813,9,1,1,7/31/2010,"Barely approaching mediocrity in terms of quality and harsh on the wallet (relative to what you're paying for). Don't forget the obnoxious lights, large crowds and the fact you'll probably either be sweating or freezing your ass in line for something you're going to feel bad about. If you want the full miserable experience make sure to head on over after last call."
7814,9,1,1,7/30/2010,"Tried to convince an out-of-friend town who came into town not to try Geno's if he wanted a cheesesteak. ˜Unfortunately, he wanted to go to the place 'that was in the Motown Philly' video. ˜Some convoluted logic if you ask me but he was my guest. ˜ Here is a recap: 1. I could care less if he has 'English-only signs' or 'Chinese-only signs' or 'Pig-Latin only signs.' ˜ 2. Servers aren't rude at Geno's. ˜They are just a bit surly and impatient. ˜There's a difference. ˜If you are from the Northeast, you understand this. ˜If not, you will likely think they are just rude. ˜ ˜ 3. Geno's uses Amoroso's rolls which is a good thing. ˜Philly bakeries make some of the best rolls in the country and Amoroso produces a good product even if they produce large amounts for commercial use. ˜Have heard anything that it is due to the quality of the water, ingredients, or the bakeries in the area. ˜Problem is that they come early in the morning and by the late evening they tend to a bit on the stale side. ˜ 4. Quality of the meat though is not a plus at Geno's. ˜They use a crappy cut of meat and it shows up in the taste. ˜You don't need top of the line sirloin. ˜Just better than what Geno's uses. 4. Servers there can make a real mess of cheesesteak including getting way too much grease with the meat. ˜Sloppy steak = soggy roll and this is a major no-no when serving any hot sandwich on a roll. ˜Presentation matters especially when it effects the overall taste of the food. ˜Geno's fails here way too often. ˜ 5. Geno's also screws up your order too often also. ˜C'mon guys I worked at a sandwich shop and it isn't that hard to remember an order with 2 stinking sandwiches. ˜ They are also irritable when you try to get them to fix it. ˜You screwed it up, you should fix it with no questions asked. ˜ 6. 'Freedom Fries' stink at Geno's. ˜Avoid them and save your $4-5 bucks. ˜ Ditto on the Roast Pork sandwich. ˜One of the worst in South Philly. 7. This is a tourist trap and the prices reflect that a bit. ˜$2 bucks for a soda? ˜$8.50 for a cheesesteak? My friend wound up disappointed especially when he got a soggy mess when he unwrapped his cheesesteak with wiz which of course didn't have onions. ˜ Told him that we would have been better off going to places that were pretty close by that just used a better cut of meat and didn't make such a mess. ˜He said now he knows and that knowing is half the battle."
7815,9,2,1,7/30/2010,"I suppose myself and the hundreds of others waiting in line and pounding down cheesesteaks are now members of the Klan, but whatever (get over it, people). I really wanted to like Geno's, especially since the liberals hate it (liberalism is a mental disorder), but unfortunately Pat's across the street is better, foodwise. ˜My buddy is a Philly native and he prefers Geno's, but I thought the quality of both the bread and the steak was too assembly line. ˜The only reason to return is to present them with a police patch from my hometown (Revere, Mass). Jim's is the best, in my opinion, overall, with Pats and Tony Lukes not too far behind. ˜Do the taste test, if you are brave, and get one from here and Pat's across the street, and experience the difference."

7817,9,2,1,7/29/2010,"As a native South Philadelphian, I've had my share of Geno's. I much prefer Pat's instead. Geno's steaks are way too fatty for my tastes, and I often waste a lot of the meat by choking on the fat and having to spit it out. It's wet and soggy, which I'm not a fan of either. The fries always taste like cardboard, most likely from their container. I know it's something of a ""tradition"" or what have you for the workers to be ""tough,"" but most of the time they're downright a*******. God forbid you so much as sip a water you didn't buy from them, they scream and yell at you like you just killed their puppy. They make fools of themselves, and if you ever do get yelled at, just hold your head high and know that it's only Geno's who should be embarrassed for what they've done. Also, it seems like every week they raise their prices more and more. A soggy, fatty, wet steak for $8, that I end up spitting most out? I know it's a tourist trap, but eh....not worth it. For a steak, a cheese fry, and one soda, it'll run you about $15 or so. That money is much better spent right across the street at Pat's. I'd rather wait twice as long for Pat's than ever eat at Geno's again. I only go now if I'm dragged there, and even then I won't give them my business."
7818,9,2,1,7/26/2010,I really don't see what all the hype is about Geno's or Pat's. ˜I've had better cheesesteaks at hole in the wall pizza joints around Philly. ˜Maybe it's South Philly preference but I lived in the Philly area for 6 years and everytime I had Geno's I was not impressed. ˜Go to Gooey Looie's instead - gooey and delicious!!
7819,9,2,1,7/26/2010,"I grew up three blocks from this place, spent a good 18 years in the neighborhood, and saw Geno's go through quite a few changes during that time. ˜Recently, since about 1999 if that is recent, the place has suffered a barrage of bad publicity, bad stocking choices, and bad management changes that has spiraled not only the image that Geno's spent so long building, but the quality of product and service. Look - here's the deal - you are in South Philly. ˜Regardless of how gentrified or diversified you think the area has gotten, you are still in South Philly. ˜Many generations have grown-up and still live in the same neighborhood, street, and even house as the ones before (both brother and father still on same street and even brother now living in father's birth house). ˜The South Philly Italian culture is very different than most people from more worldly and exposed regions may be accustom to and it tends to grate them the wrong way or espouse an emetic feeling from their deep suppressed nethermost region. Geno's, not unlike most things and people from Philadelphia, are over criticized and not appreciated for what it is. ˜Note much in Philly has some ulterior motive or purpose, or tries to cater towards a specific demographic. ˜It is, truly, just what it is. ˜Geno's grew up around the Italian market which was a place immigrants went during the 30s and 40s to obtain cheap, poor quality, food during the post-depression era. ˜Once the yuppies (of which I admit I have grown into) moved into the area, they tried to make it a high-end outdoor Dean and DeLuca ... it isn't that, and you shouldn't be surprised if the locals get a little ticked off when they see their neighborhood grocery store or for that matter steak place start to change. ˜I remember going here as a kid and getting a steak sandwhich being surrounded by all people I knew from the neighborhood. ˜We used to go after school sometimes and it would be all Catholic school kids from around the area. ˜It wasn't until Oprah got a hold of this place, and the roaring 90's took foot, that the almighty dollar drew in more tourists and outsiders. ˜Most tourists would just settle on grabbing a steak from Oliveri's or on South Street rather than venture down to ""Pass-shunk"" (not Pas-e-yunk even if that is how you pronounce it). Bottom line - it's South Philly ... if you are coming here for sightseeing and a steak, don't you want the full experience? ˜If you have ever been to Italy, in particular the ""real"" northern industrial towns of Italy (Torino, Milano, Verona, Bologna) then you know, as I do, that South Philly is about as Italian as you can get, and Geno's is a close second. ˜The attitude is part of our culture, accept it or grab a steak from a tourist trap on Independence Mall. That said --- whew, nice rant huh, the steaks are OK and nothing special ... I prefer actually Jim's on South."
7820,9,2,1,7/23/2010,"geno's looks like the vegas strip and goes with the less is more approach to cheesesteaks. the grilled onions and bread taste better than pat's, but they put far less meat in the sandwich. ˜onions are sweet and not over-cooked in grease. ˜the bread has a slight crisp to it. ˜on the up side is not as greasy as pat's. ˜they also put less cheese wiz on my husband's, but i am not sure he really needs anymore hydrogenated vegetable oil and yellow dye #6 either. sometimes you just have to know what all the hype about this street corner is all about. ˜it'll cost you about $20 to compare and contrast pat's versus geno's. ˜and it will probably be enjoyable if your expectations are not that high."
7821,9,1,1,7/20/2010,"Awful. My vegetarian friend asked for a sandwich with cheese and grilled onion, and he got nothing but onions. And charged for full amount. Awful. I had the regular, no flavor, no seasoning. Not worth the effort. I think they took down the sign about not welcoming those who don't speak English. Terrible."
7822,9,2,1,7/20/2010,All you need to know about Geno's is across the street at Pat's. ˜No comparison; Pat's is the best. ˜Do yourself a favor and head across the street....
7823,9,4,1,7/20/2010,"I have only heard stories about Geno's from my girlfriend who lived in Philly while going to grad school, so on our visit through Philly, we went. ˜I was very interested in trying this ""hype."" ˜So, we tried the original cheese steak with onions and whiz. As I was in line at Geno's, my girlfriend was in line at Pat's across the street. ˜We both waited in line and met about the same time. ˜What I could not believe was that it was hot hot hot out, 95 degrees and sweltering. ˜For a Sunday at 2:30pm, I could not believe what I was actually waiting in line for, a sandwich. When we both met back up, with both sandwiches, we did a taste test between the two. ˜I thought Geno's was better, slightly, I could barely tell the difference. ˜Truthfully, Geno's and Pat's tasted the same to me as an outsider from Denver, CO. ˜My girlfriend liked Pat's better. Personally, I think the hype is much more popular than the food and everything has just blown up. ˜I've heard locals tell me that the bar between the two is better than both Pat's OR Geno's. It was a good lunch, but I'm not sure I would ever wait more than five minutes for either again."
7824,9,1,1,7/18/2010,"Stay away, people! ˜Whether you are from Philly or not, know this: ˜Giving Joey Vento (owner of Geno's) your money is a vote for his hateful, small-minded, obnoxious politics, which permeate the signage and attitude of the place. Hey I love me a good steak, believe you me, and I have certainly *had* Geno's before (live in Philly long enough and it's an eventuality) but if you're gonna do the long-line-in-the-street-waiting-for-a-genuine cheese steak thing, there is the humble and venerable Pat's directly across the street: ˜just as good but without the side helping of bigotry."
7825,9,4,1,7/15/2010,"During my first time out in Philly, I knew I had to get a steak sandwich. ˜One thing I have to say is you can definitely see this place three miles away. ˜I remembered driving there at night without a map or GPS. ˜All I was able to see was the Huge Neon Light with a gigantic picture of a Cheese Steak. ˜ It was like finding the oasis of steak sandwiches. ˜I satisfied that adventure by ordering a Whiz Wit.

7826,9,5,1,7/14/2010,The best! Either way their both fantastic! Just make sure you know what you are going to order before you get up to the window!
7827,9,1,1,7/14/2010,"My fiance and I tried Geno's after experiencing the awesomeness at Pat's. Geno's does NOT even compare to Pat's. Geno's steak was chewy and fatty. The fries were soggy and disgusting. Next time we go, Pat's it is!"
7828,9,1,1,7/12/2010,"First and foremost, Geno's is not as good as Pat's. ˜Period. Second, Geno's seems to be the cheese steak restaurant for the xenophobic, racist crowd of Philadelphia, which is a huge turn off for me. I cannot endorse patronizing a restaurant whose owner is a bigoted racist. ˜I think it's highly inappropriate that there are signs and bumper stickers all over about their requirement for ""Ordering in English only"" and ""Freedom Fries."" ˜The entire existence of this place was a huge turn off. And, their steaks just weren't as good as Pat's. ˜I can kindly say my mom paid for this, so I feel good about not giving them my own money, but the food was not good. ˜The steak was tough and completely flavorless. ˜The roll was enormous so there was just bland steak and bread to eat. ˜The only flavor was the Whiz, which is always good, but still. ˜We even got onions on the steak and couldn't taste them. ˜Odd. Don't go here. ˜At all. ˜It may seem tempting from across the street when you're at Pat's, but you'll definitely thank yourself for staying at Pat's and never giving Geno's a dime. ˜Xenophobia is disgusting and these people should be put out of business. ˜Quickly."
7829,9,4,1,7/12/2010,"Well, the hubby and I finally took a trip into Philly yesterday as we are on a mission to try both Geno's Steaks and Pat's. Last time it was Pat's so now this time it was Geno's. Well, when I first opened up the paper to view my cheese steak, my first reaction was that it was smaller than Pat's but I'm not always about things being big. I took my first bite and I have to say, I thought the steak was better as well as the whiz (I have no idea how whiz would taste better on one sandwich than another, perhaps they season it?). The meat was much more tender and I believe tasted better but hey, I'll eat just about anything! I also really liked bread. For now, until I try another Philly cheese steak house (as I hear there are tons of them) I'm a Geno's girl!"

The food quality? ˜Everyone at Pat's say Geno's isn't as good. ˜I haven't had Geno's but I don't plan to give them a penny. Save your money, go across the street to Pat's.

7831,9,1,1,7/9/2010,"As a native Philadelphian who has been eating cheesesteaks for nearly 40 years, I find it hard to believe that anyone could think Geno's is anything more than a tourist trap glomming off its location near Pat's. ˜The taste ans texture of the meat is inferior, the whiz is often not properly stirred so as to lead to inconsistency, the fries are often lukewarm and not properly crisp. ˜Save your time and money and go elsewhere."
7832,9,2,1,7/7/2010,really nothing special about this place or the sandwiches ˜ ˜ ˜Not bad but I really don't understand the hype add in the long lines and piss poor service with the tons of tacky pictures of who must be Geno with celebrities and it left me a little angry that I ate here or maybe it was all the somewhat racist stickers all I did like their sandwich better than Pat's though
7833,9,2,1,7/6/2010,"Greasy, dripping with cheese, cheap and, for what it's worth, good. While you probably wouldn't find a serious food critic even looking at the place if you want something that will fill you up, leave your breath tasting like onions and make you question eating the whole thing this is the place. When you get there you'll know it. If you're within a 3 block radius at night you'll know it. It looks like a Vegas strip reject sent to Philadelphia. The food is just like the place, loud in your face and over the top."
7834,9,4,1,7/6/2010,"Just did my first trip to both Geno's and Pat's for a Philly Fourth of July visit with friends. I would say it lives up to all expectations of the Philly Cheesesteak Rivalry that I've heard of. ˜I will say that we ended up with slower service here than at Pat's (we're talking on the order of maybe a two minutes more in line; not too big a deal). ˜ Between four friends, we split a Wiz Wit and Wiz Witout from each of the the competitors, and I will say that my favorite by a long lead was Geno's Wiz Witout. The bread was fresh, the cheese was steaming, and the steak was drippin. ˜All in all a very good experience and delicious little taste of Philly! As for parking, we did cheat a bit by parking a block down at the spacious Acme parking lot. ˜Unless there's a torrential downpour or 4 feet of snow on the ground, the walk is just fine."
7835,9,1,1,6/30/2010,"I came to Philadelphia to try their famous cheese steak sandwiches. Our group arrived to the destination and looked at the lines at Pat's and decided to go with Geno's, which had considerably much shorter lines...and for good reason. There is nothing special here. The bread is okay, they meat quality is low. The cheese is fake (cheeze whiz) albiet it has a lot more flavor than the provolone. I think you almost need the strong taste of cheeze whiz for some kind of flavour because the meat definitely offers none. It also doesn't help that the tables are dirty and the help is rude. I had to pour some bottled water on the table and wipe it down really well because it was so covered in cheese and grease. When I went back to the counter to ask for a bag to take back some extra sandwiches, the man completly ignored me. Here I am, standing in front of him, saying ""excuse me sir. Sir? Sir can I get a bag? Sir?"" Yeah....he just looked straight ahead and pretended I was not there. Now I know why people go to Pats!!!!!!"
7836,9,4,1,6/28/2010,"Made the two - three hour trip down from NYC to do two things. 1. See the Liberty Bell 2. Compare Pat's and Geno's Cheesesteaks. After the Liberty Bell, I made my way down to the two infamous cheesesteak shops, despite how many yelpers seem to deem them inferior to other cheesesteaks in the area. ˜Perhaps they are right, but for my first time excursion in Philadelphia, I had to try the two shops I heard most about over the past few years. As far as service goes both seem to be equally as fast. ˜Service of sandwiches are usually under 10 - 15 seconds from the time you order. ˜Despite what they my say on television, I don't believe you have to order ""in a special manner, cheese WIT or cheese WIT-OUT,"" at Pat's. ˜Its probably more of a gimmick then anything. ˜As long as you don't stutter, you should be alright. Onto the sandwiches. ˜Pat's had a bit more meat in their sandwich but Geno's was more tender and I found that the bread that Geno's had used tasted better, it had a bit of sweetness as well as a nice bit of moisture in comparison to that of Pat's. ˜In the end I ended up bringing only one Pat's Cheesesteak home, while also bringing home 3 Geno's Cheesesteaks. Nothing wrong with Pat's Cheesesteaks, but nothing special either. ˜I would probably comeback to both however if I was back in Philly to do another taste test. ˜Maybe it depends on who is working that day? Until then, Geno's over Pats"
7837,9,4,1,6/28/2010,"Not sure why this place has such bad reviews. The only reason I took off a star was because they are cash only. The parking sucks here but you can double park in front of a driveway and you'll be gone before the owners have a chance to complain. The service is super fast here. The staff is rude but when you have a line of customers down the street, you have to keep people moving. I had a cheese steak with whiz and onions. Never had a steak with whiz before but it was the best way to go. My friends had steaks with other kinds of cheese but the whiz was the best, hands down. This place is open 24/7 and has outside tables. Probably too cold to sit outside in the winter. IT was bearable to sit outside in June for us. But I admit, I was sweating from just sitting and munching because it was so hot. Bring cash. No credit cards accepted here. If you never had a steak in Philly, go here. Get it with Whiz!"
7838,9,2,1,6/21/2010,steak is good. ˜needs better bread. ˜not the right ratio.
7839,9,1,1,6/15/2010,"After hearing a lot about Pat's and Geno's, I finally tried both of them last night and I definitely prefer the Pat's experience over Geno's. This is mostly because Pat's more laid back atmosphere and lack of aggressive pseudo-xenophobic undertones made me feel better about eating there. That being said, I have had much better cheesesteaks at Redding Terminal Market at lesser known shops. The meat at Geno's was pretty dry and flavorless."
7840,9,1,1,6/15/2010,"You stand in line with smelly trash cans all around (nothing like the smell of rotting food to get you hungry) and you get up to the front and see signs ""This is America Speak English"" and nasty servers. When I travel to different countries, I am glad they are not as nasty. Can you imagine going to Italy and not eating because you don't speak fluent Italian? Shame on Genos!"
7841,9,2,1,6/13/2010,"Ok, I'm from California and so I went to visit this place since my friend lives in Delaware. So when I went to this place, I thought the place would be an easy place to find......NOOOOO!!!!!!! Instead, it's in a place that's like a back alley place with horrible parking and crowded areas. ˜But, when I went to Geno's, it was lighted up like a Las Vegas strip mall. So, we went to buy some of the sandwiches and we both noticed that there was two windows, each side had different menus: one for the drinks and fries, and the other for the sandwiches. ˜IMO, I never seen this and literally, I don't like the fact that I have to order from two different windows just to get the drinks. So, noooo!!!. ˜Anyways, my friend and I order their TWO different types of sandwiches (Pat's by the way have over 20 items on their menu) with the typical three different types of cheese: cheez whiz, provolone, and american. So what to choose!?!?!?!?!?!? I chose the cheesesteak w/ onions and cheez whiz. ˜My friend orders the same with provolone and cheez whiz and without onions....but the sandwich didn't come with the cheez whiz and it had onions in it (BOOOOOO!!!!). ˜ We didn't want to go back to the counter since the guy making the sandwich and the woman on the cash register looked like they'd want to take a .... well, you know what I mean. ˜So, we both bring the sandwiches to a table and eat the food. ˜When I took a bite of that sandwich, I wanted more. ˜That's why I gave it 2 stars just to be reasonable. ˜But, the bread was too thick with what little meat they put in it. ˜So, in my experience, go to Geno's for their overpriced sandwiches and their sandwiches in which you'll taste more of the cheese and the sandwich than the meat that's in it. ˜I like the sandwich for what it is....but that's all they have to impress."
7842,9,2,1,6/13/2010,"I drove from NY to try the Philly cheese steaks with whiz (also stopped at Pat's). ˜After having them (both Geno's and Pat's) I wouldn't drive down the street for them, let alone for two hours. There was nothing remarkable about these sandwiches (other than the hype and cost)."
7843,9,4,1,6/13/2010,"Geno's, located in South Philly, forms a formidable intersection with Pat's across the street. The layout here is better and I prefer the steaks here, although there is nothing wrong with Pat's. As a previous reviewer commented, the bread is good. It is requested that one orders in English. Food is not denied if it is not. An inquiry into the sign found it to be acceptable. Anyhow, back to the food . . . good! While it is a touristy thing to do, when in Philly, treat yourself."
7844,9,1,1,6/11/2010,"I wonder if anywhere else in the world they'd refuse to serve you if you didn't happen to speak the local language. Geno's cheesy joint churns out more hate than food. Mix xenophobia with food and you get smelly trash. Yeah, and... I hear they spit on your food if you aren't white. Pure class! Thanks, but...no, thanks."
7845,9,1,1,6/9/2010,"We visited Geno's and their nearby competitor based on a couple shows on a popular travel cable channel. Based on our experience, it is obvious the cable channel is not interested in eking out good food, but filming a location-based food story. Geno's is located in a single lane, tightly knit, blue-collar neighborhood. You can't miss Geno's as it is lit up like a cheap Vegas hotel. The food? The traditionally thin steak is not chopped (not my preference) and was dry and lacking much flavor. There were no napkins or condiments visible. The staff was abrupt and unfriendly. There were stickers placed on the windows with political/social messages that left me feeling very uncomfortable. Our summary? Uneasy atmosphere and bad food means no more visits."
7846,9,2,1,6/8/2010,"Wow, wasn't going to go here at 2am, but did... and had the opportunity to compare the two better known cheesesteak joints in Philly. You go to the one window to order your sandwich and another to order your drinks and sides... I guess this is how it's done around here (same with Pat's). ˜I ordered my sandwich with cheese and onion, then went to the other window to get my drink. The bread itself was okay, I was told that the bread make the difference when it comes to the cheesesteak... the meat was not cut, rather the sliced meat was cooked as it was sliced and placed in the bread... off to the side by the second window, they have some other items, such as hot peppers you can get, so adding the hot peppers made it taste better. ˜The meat itself was very blend, meaning that the seasoning from other items in the cheesesteak did not help to improve the taste. ˜ Having to take a taxi from downtown to Geno's, I for sure would have to think twice about coming... r/t, $20 for the taxi and another $8+ for the meal... it was an expensive meal... but, if Pat's didn't exist on the other side, then I would probably not come back..."
7847,9,2,1,6/8/2010,"After a day of taste testing cheesesteaks around Philly, this was the clear cut loser...how sad. The problem really was the meat itself. Dry and kind of stringy. Dunno whats going on there. Service was a bit brusque as well, but not really looking for star service i guess."
7848,9,3,1,6/7/2010,"more like 3.5 stars. but the fact that it's so inaccessible for someone who has to rely on public transportation (i hate you septa) makes me round down to 3 stars. as i've said in my other cheesesteak reviews, i'm not really a cheesesteak fan so my opinion is very biased. i did a one day tour of the three cheesesteak places i had heard about in the south street area in one day. geno's, pat's, and jim's.. so i could get a direct comparison. i think after that, i'd be happy not to see another cheesesteak for the rest of my life. so of the three, the best overall package was geno's in my mind. i was probably won over by the EXTREMELY soft bread and how the cheese melted perfectly with the meat to create this soft mushy bread-cheese-meat sandwich. melt in your mouth goodness. but no cheesesteak is worth this trek (for me). jim's had better meat, but the bread and cheese were lacking. and pat's was just deficient on all three levels. one of these days, i'll try those 4 star cheesesteak places farther out from the city. but until i can get there easily, cheesesteaks are a no-go. i guess what that means is i need to get a car. or a motorcycle. orrr hire a personal chauffeur."
7849,9,1,1,6/6/2010,"Tell ya what, here's the deal: for the low price of one dollar, I'll drop a steaming pile of half-digested Chinese buffet on a roll and top it off with a stream of hot whiz--not the cheese kind. Hell, I'll even encourage you to speak whatever language you wish. Then I will kick you in the junk until you vomit it all up. As terrible as this might sound, I guarantee you will be more satisfied with my offer than what you'll get at Geno's. Although, I suppose if you enjoy being surrounded by mindless masses whose insipidity is surpassed only by the overpriced garbage they're shoveling into their mouths, Geno's is paradise. I think the fact that most of the reviews by Philadelphians average a generous 1.5 stars speaks volumes about this appalling place. Oh, and don't be confused to think that this is any kind of endorsement for that other hellhole Pat's across the street."
7850,9,1,1,6/4/2010,"If zero stars were an option, I'd be there. Dry, tasteless meat - 3 little pieces with rude service to top it off. I was prepared and almost relished the idea of the typical Philly experience, until they gave me five sandwiches for my group, when I ordered four, which totaled $42.50 USD. Keep in mind this doesn't include your drinks or fries...that's another line! We didn't even realize that they had charged and given us five sandwiches because the staff were screaming at one another. Was a sad experience and I would NEVER recommend going here. DRY Cardboard is the best way I could describe this sandwich. Save you money and time. There was a 30 minute wait. We had wanted to try Pat's but his line was more like an hour. Either way, I'd save yourself the trouble and just graze through Reading Terminal. South Street has some wonderful choices as well. The Italian market area near Pats/Genos was the best and that's certainly worth a visit but forget about the worst Cheesesteak ever...just forget about it."
7851,9,4,1,6/4/2010,"probably more like 3.5 stars. ˜it was a solid cheese steak. ˜meat was probably the best part. ˜a little salty, fairly big slices. ˜i had the whiz with onions. ˜i could've gone for thicker whiz, it was very watery. ˜onions were good. ˜service was very fast btw. ˜i'm no cheese steak connoisseur, but this seemed like a solid cheese steak, though I recall having better in the past. ˜maybe I'll try pat's tomorrow... also it's cash only"
7852,9,3,1,5/31/2010,"Saw the dueling Cheesesteaks Episode on the Travel Channel. Thought that I absolutely had to come here to eat a Philly Cheesesteak. I actually was dissuaded to go to Genos because I felt like they were on steroids regarding advertising. I did a quick glance between Pat's and Genos and actually liked the relaxed view of Pats better. There were tour buses doing drive by's and there were high school students swarming at the time that I went. My honest opinion: Just a meat sandwich. I've actually had better steak sandwiches in California. I think I should have probably tried Jim's in downtown. Report: MEAT: ˜was tender and more on the salty side than Pat's. Juicy. Sandwich is about a foot long. WHIZ: (Cheese) was on the liquidy side. It should have been thick and cheesy ONIONS: I liked the onions on top. They are square cut and sauteed CHOICE: You have a choice between American cheese, whiz or Provolone. If you want a classic Philly, then get Whiz and onions SERVICE: Super quick, in fact instantaneous. I didn't even get a chance to blink and I had my sandwich piping hot in my hand. DRINKS: You slide down to the next window and order your drinks. A bottle of water is about $2.00. A regular soda is around $1.50. In regards to the Ambience, its outdoor seating overlooking a community baseball park. The area has history in regards to immigrant populations. You could see old dumbbell tenements, an Asian community and Italian influence. It feels like a nice place to have lunch. The weather was right, so it was a nice day to eat outside. Lunch: $10.00 for a drink and a philly cheesesteak. I should have had a local beer and some fries or something else to try. About an 8 to 10 minute drive from downtown. Pretty easy to get to. Oh and I got a complimentary Geno's pen (great marketing skills). I would go here again, but not crave it. It was a good experience and it was cool to see it. I asked local cab drivers and local Philly people. It was a split review down the middle of which cheesesteak was better Genos' or Pat's. It's kind of like the chicken and the egg. So instead of saying which one is better, just accept the fact that Philly people love cheesesteaks and they love their meat. I can appreciate that."
7853,9,2,1,5/31/2010,"Note: This is a ""cut & paste"" review from Pat's...Why? ˜They're the damn same and they're both a horrible misrepresentation of what a true cheesesteak is today. Really look at the average Local Rating : About 2 stars. ˜Heed local reviews! Review: 2 things define a steak...Bread & Steak. ˜Steak here is good but their bread is just ho hum, if not sort of bad... Do not come here if: You want a GREAT Philly Cheesesteak (Tourists note, a Philly Cheesesteak Hoagie is a totally different entity w/ let, tom & on) You want polite service. You hate scenes or lines. Come Here For: An iconically touristy Philly experience. ˜This locale is in South Philly, can be (was) dangerous about a block or two away and shares with Pat's a mini times square grid interruption. You're drunk, you just got out of Delilah's and need a steak. ˜It's open 24/7. Tips: It is not ""Un Philly"" to order anything other than Wiz With (I pronounce my ""H""'s damn it. ˜I also say ""you guys"". ˜I'm talking to yous). ˜Do whatever the hell you want, it's your sandwich. ˜Most Philadelphians (Suburbs Included) will go with American Cheese not Wiz. Go here late night. ˜Geno's neon is a sight to be seen, there's just a good enough roughness to the crowd that makes it betterer. Annoy the guy at the counter a little by saying ""I'll have a Cheesesteak w/ American Cheese"" instead of ""American Wit(h)"". ˜Add a ""please"" and a ""thank you"" in for good measure too."
7854,9,1,1,5/30/2010,"Racist owners aside, this place is simply nothing but a tourist trap. ˜You can get a better cheesesteak at nearly any local spot in Philadelphia. ˜Do yourself a favor and walk a block down to 8th & Dickinson and get a much better sandwich at Cosmi's Deli. ˜One might argue ""but it's open all night!"" - well so is Pat's, and Pat's is a hell of a lot better. ˜Avoid Geno's like the plague."
7855,9,1,1,5/29/2010,"Good steaks or not, this establishment is owned and operated by a xenophobic racist piece of shit. Do NOT patronize these cocksuckers. GO TO PAT'S!!!!"
7856,9,4,1,5/26/2010,"Despite this place being overrated, I came here with an open mind & I actually enjoyed it! I didn't have time to look at the many displays of signs, photos, etc. I ordered a whiz with & cheese fries! I do agree the cheesesteak wasn't as good as Philip's but the cheesefries were AWESOME! So the cheesesteak, I didn't enjoy the bread as much, not enough onions, but the meat was pretty good. It wasn't as juicy as Philip's :( The cheese fries were good! The fries were perfect and the cheese made it even better. Service wasn't as friendly as Philip's for sure. Hmmm"
7857,9,1,1,5/23/2010,"I will keep this review short and simple, because I am American and speak english (I know that joke was two years too late) if your not a tourist and you rate this place higher then a one star you Philadelphia privileges are revoked. ˜Turn in your Ben Franklin wig and stop eating soft pretzels. ˜So many better steaks then this one go somewhere else."
7858,9,2,1,5/23/2010,Between Pat's and Geno's.. Pat's is the winner. ˜Sorry Geno's but I dislike your neon lights and your hard bread in comparison to Pat's. ˜Plus.. you were mean to my friend's friend. nadsbakery.com/2010/05/d?
7859,9,1,1,5/22/2010,Rude owner and employees never make up for halfway decent food.
7860,9,3,1,5/20/2010,Headed straight for Pat and Geno's off the plane. Tried them both and preferred Geno's. I did not like that Pat's chopped up the steak while Geno's left it whole. Definitely order Geno's and with provolone.
7861,9,2,1,5/20/2010,"Philadelphia, you should be ashamed of this establishment. Not even for the English-only/proud-to-be-American schpeel. I'm taking that out of the equation, because I'm trying to judge on food alone. The bread looked good, but the texture was awful. Way too chewy. Beef not seasoned very well. I can understand going to a restaurant for kitsch factor, and typically the food isn't the best, but good enough to be enjoyed. It's like Cafe du Monde in New Orleans. Not the best beignets, but at least they're good. Or Ben's Chili Bowl in DC. Not the best chili nor half-smokes, but still good enough. Well Philadelphia. Geno's is NOT good enough. I've had better steaks from a mall. Good riddance."
7862,9,1,1,5/19/2010,"Geno's cheesesteaks are made from the richest chewy rat meat in all of Philadelphia, and are delicately prepared on a rusty stove cooked in baby oil. If Geno's put as much effort in their cheesesteaks as they do trying to break the Guiness World Record for the largest street light of all-time, then maybe I'd give them 2 stars."
7863,9,3,1,5/15/2010,"I like Geno's better than Pat's. ˜Always have. ˜It is decent steak and I'll get one if i'm in the area. ˜That being said, it is NOT worth going out of your way for. ˜John's Roast Pork is the BEST CHEESESTEAK IN PHILLY."

""lets start this all over"". ˜Seriously? ˜Start it all over because I changed the only drink I ordered from Diet Coke to Pepsi? ˜I was ordering two orders of fries and one drink. ˜I agree with other people who have posted about the offensive signs. ˜This is America and I am guessing we should order in English if we want them to understand what we want... but have they not heard of tourists? ˜Does money not speak every language? ˜I would never go back to this place... save yourself some time and go across the street to Pats."
7865,9,2,1,5/10/2010,"Note: ˜This is part 2 of a 4 part series of an unhealthy weekend cheesesteak tour. Compared to Pat's at least this was edible, but my bowels would eventually disagree with this assertion. ˜It tasted like a typical greasy cheesesteak, but one that I shelled out entirely too much money for and waited too long for. ˜I seriously am questioning now what's wrong with Philly that they idolize these two famous places. ˜They're awful!! ˜And another thing, what's the deal with Amoroso's bread, it tastes like mealworm....I don't know, compost! from science class. ˜That's suppose to be more insulting that it sounds. ˜IT'S STEAK-EMS, CHEESE WIZ ON BREAD, WHAT'S SO HARD??? ˜As you see, I'm now shouting in frustration."
7866,9,1,1,5/7/2010,"My husband decided to stop by Geno's on our drive back to Maryland from New Jersey. He heard all these great reviews about it. So we were excited about trying it out. Well the food was not what we expected. I've tasted better philly subs where I live in Maryland. This restaurant has all the hype because it has been here forever, but they lack to deliver quality food. The steak was bland and the fries had an awful after taste. So I was truly disappointed!!!! Maybe since they have been here for so long they don't put as much effort into the taste. There are only 2 types of sandwiches: one with provolone cheese and the other has American cheese (which is basically Cheese Wiz) and both have onions. I have never once eaten a philly sub that required me to add ketchup because of it being so dry. The provolone cheese sub was so dry!!!! Who would ever think about putting cheese wiz on a philly sub??? The only reason why this tasted better to me was because it wasn't dry. I could care less for neither one of them. Does anyone ever come out to clean those tables? They all were filthy. On top of the wind blowing all of our napkins on the ground, we had to sit at a dirty table. Bring some Clorox or Lysol wipes with you if you plan to eat here."
7867,9,4,1,5/2/2010,Personally I think this is better than Pat's. The hot sauce is phenomenal!
7868,9,3,1,4/28/2010,"Geno's cheesesteaks are okay, but I like Pat's better. So unless the line is too long at Pat's, I'll stick with Pat's. I also like Pat's better than Jim's."
7869,9,1,1,4/27/2010,"The ""wiz fries"" are real good but the sandwiches are pretty gross and a big disappointment. They tasted like steak 'ems but worse quality meat. I guess there is a reason for all those lights. Try to attract tourists who don't know the difference and think they're eating a ""Philly cheesesteak."" Amount of wiz and steak they give you is a joke. The real deal is across the street without all the glitz and glam. Also, at least the people at Pat's are funny when they insult you. The cashiers here are just plain jerks. Would not recommend to my worst enemy. The best part was the wait seeing all the celebrity photos."
7870,9,1,1,4/26/2010,"I have not been here in 2 years. However since one of my friends visiting me wanted to have a sandwich from here, I reluctantly agreed to take him there. He loves their steaks and has to come here when he visits me. The lines yesterday afternoon were not long and we got our sandwich in 2 minutes unlike the previous occasion when the wait was over 30 minutes. As usual, I did not expect to like the cheesesteak and it was bad. Plus this time instead of fried onions, they had raw onions. Seriously they cannot even fry the onions right. My other complaint is the price. For the amount of meat in the sandwich, they should be charging $5 instead of $8.50. The only positive is this place looks clean unlike their competitor across the street. Luckily my friend also was very disappointed so I won't be coming here ever again."
7871,9,1,1,4/23/2010,"Part of a restaurant's appeal always resides in the ambiance. ˜Unfortunately, the one here is utterly devoid of any tact and displays only an uncouth degree of sheer ignorance. ˜This is a tourist attraction, for sure, and their steaks are fairly decent, but the offensive signs stating: ""This is America, when ordering, speak English"" are reason enough for me to stay away. ˜So abysmally rude, even to an American, like me. ˜ Go to Pat's instead. ˜They give you a bigger portion of steak, and it's more flavorful."
7872,9,1,1,4/18/2010,"If I could give this place a ZERO I would! Everything about this place makes me sick. They barely put anything inside the sandwiches and most importantly the flavor is BLAND. What a waste of money. If you want real cheesesteaks, go to Dalessandro's. It's farther out but worth the trek!"
7873,9,2,1,4/18/2010,"Tourist trap... should really be located in Manayunk or Old City. Seriously... any place that serves steaks with wiz is. The BS ordering protocol... it's a factory... plain and simple... hence the pile of already cooked meat / onions, etc... go here because you want to say you were there, not because you were looking for a good cheesesteak. They get a solid 2 stars mainly because of the decent cherry peppers they have at the condiment stand... and that they are open 24 hours. The best cheesesteak in the city is at John's Roast Pork."
7874,9,1,1,4/18/2010,Waste of $7.00 for a little amount of meat when you just need pepto bismol fifteen minutes later. The only good thing about Geno's is that it is open late for all for all of those people who are looking to eat at 2am after the bars let out. I am NOT one to promote the North East at all but... IF YOU WANT A REAL CHEESE STEAK IN PHILLY GO TO CHINK'S IN THE NORTHEAST.
7875,9,2,1,4/15/2010,"Decided to compare the 2 best known cheesesteak places in Philly. Since Geno's and Pat's are just across from each other, I ordered a cheesesteak from each place with a bottled water and chomped away. The bread: -- Bread from Pat's was way too tough/. Not only did I have to bite into the bread, but I had to literally tear the bread in order to take any bites. The bread from Geno's was way easier to tolerate. The steak: -- The portion of meat from Geno's was much smaller than Pat's. Also, the meat from Pat's was much more seasoned. I'm not sure if Geno's seasons their meat with anything 'cause it basically tasted like unseasoned roast beef. The filling: -- I got Whiz With (with cheese whiz and with onions) at both places. I liked Geno's onions better, but the whiz was better from Pat's since Geno's was very skimpy on the whiz. The whiz is easily visible on the Pat's cheesesteak, but Geno's put a VERY TINY amount at the bottom of their cheesesteak. I almost went back to ask if they had forgotten to put it on. The price: -- It's same at both places. $8.25 for cheesesteak. ˜***CASH ONLY*** Service: -- Service at both locations sucked big time. I guess it's part of the whole ""lure"" to be rude and even curse at the customers. But I am not into this whole dumb idea of ˜""Hahhahaa. I just got cursed at at a tourist trap. I can't wait to post it on Facebook and Twitter!"" ˜I still expect people to be nice, especially people who are servicing customers. Personally, both places sucked. The food wasn't all that bad but it wasn't anything close to what I was expecting. I expected more flavor, more meat, more cheese, and most importantly, more taste. ˜ It's cool to check out if you are a tourist. Geno's totally had the look of seedy old Las Vegas decor going on."
7876,9,1,1,4/15/2010,"Beef on a bun.....what's the appeal? ˜Tony Lukes puts this ""stuff"" to shame. ˜Pure tourist trap.....DO NOT GO....expensive for what you get....1/4 the beef of a tony lukes cheesesteak hoagie. ˜Didn't bother going to pats......Sorry folks, just overrated and i tell it like I feel it. 2 whiz wit ˜cheese fries and 2 cokes"
7877,9,2,1,4/14/2010,"My high school friends and I had a reunion in Philly because one of them goes to med school in Philly. So we went on a mission to Pat's, Geno's, and Jim's to determine which cheesesteak was the best. Once I saw the exterior of Geno's, I had a feeling this was going to rank low on my list. I kinda felt like I was in downtown Las Vegas, where the lights are bright but vibe is...weird. Anyway, I didn't like Geno's at all. And it didn't even look good. The meat was pale and was cut like how I expect it in beef and broccoli from a Chinese restaurant. In fairness though, the cashier was very nice to me. So a star for that."
7878,9,4,1,4/12/2010,"I have not had a cheesesteak in 25 years so when it was time to give it a try I thought I would go to the source, well, at least the source across the street from the originator. I see comments about the rude staff. I did not see anything like that and my hallucination is if you communicate and are not rude to them you are not going to have a problem. You also need to keep it quick - supposedly this place can pump out up to 4,500 steaks in a day so if you are going to waste time no one is going to be happy. For the food. Hands down better than Pat's and that is Whiz-Wit in boths cases. Why four stars? They are next door to Pat's and I prefer the steaks from Geno's -- that alone gives them four stars."
7879,9,3,1,4/11/2010,"Wiz wit. (that's cheesewhiz with onions on the cheesesteak for the neophytes) Geno's was ok, although it did not live up to the hype. The bread was great, what steak I had was tender but the portion was lacking, onions saut?ed, and whiz was wonderful. I think I was expecting a bit more flavor- it was just bland. The majority of the flavor came from the onions and wiz. Pat's was much better, and even Tony Luke's was better than the Geno experience. Maybe next time I will order two and see if that will make a difference."
7880,9,3,1,4/9/2010,"came here with several people so we decided to split up and order at both pat's and geno's. Geno's line was a little longer, and i believe, like moths to a light, the flashiness is what attracted most of the people to it. The cheesesteak was good, but I've definitely had gooder. But I tell you what, the biggest satisfaction I got out of eating at both Pat's and Geno's was the fact that they are such historic joints. Are you guys going to go see the Liberty Bell and say that it was whack because it's cracked, old, and ugly??!?! NO, didn't think so."
7881,9,3,1,4/8/2010,"Asking people between Geno's and Pat's gets some strong responses. I learned that asking which to go to and why would bring on a pretty decent conversation about the steak, bread, size, price, history, etc. So when visiting a friend we relied on her family's history of cheese steak selection. Geno's was a good cheese steak. The bread was great, steak tender, onions perfectly cooked down, and cheese was ooey gooey. I enjoyed the experience of ordering "" Whiz Wit"" and picking up my order at the different windows, even eating it. I felt the cheese steak was good, just plain. I think I was expecting a bit more saltiness or flavor- it was just bland. The majority of the flavor came from the onion and cheese. I'll give them, and maybe Pat's, another try during another visit to Philly."

See Donavan McNabb play in person in an Eagles uniform 3. ˜Eat a REAL Philly Cheese Steak in Philadelphia Well, I was about 2 months too late to accomplish goal #1 and the DAY that I arrived to Philadelphia for the first time in my life, the Eagles trade McNabb to a conf rival, which left me with only goal #3. ˜Now I should preface this review by saying that I'm not exactly an expert on philly cheesesteak sandwiches as I've only had one in my whole entire life. ˜But talking to people who've visited/lived in Philly they say Geno's is the place to go, so onward to our trip we go to the city of brotherly love. ˜Don't be overwhelmed by the super duper long line cuz they are damn efficient. ˜There's two lines, one for the sandwich and a second line for fries, sides, drinks, etc. ˜Playing it conservative, I had a plain cheeseteak sandwich with no sides and a side of utlra cheese greese fries. ˜The sandwich itself was about $7 and the cheese fries about $3. ˜I'd have to say that it's not the cheapest of lunches and there's probably better alternatives out there, but hey I'm in Philly and I deperately wanted to have my first time experience at some place historical. ˜Well, nothing to brag about, sandwich and cheese fries were good nothing spectacular, but like I said not too experienced with that cuisine. ˜Don't think I'll go back but at least I can cross #3 off my wish list."
7883,9,1,1,4/5/2010,"Ughh. If I could give zero stars I would. The employees are so rude. Their exterior is obnoxious, they are outRAGEOUSLY expensive, and the steak is usually a little dry. So is the bread. No thanks. If you're a tourist and you just HAVE to try Pat's or Geno's, I'd do Pat's. The cost is exactly the same, and I've found that the steaks are a little better. Definitely get whiz."
7884,9,1,1,4/5/2010,"Wow.. I know I'm a tourist and bought into the hype but, I think I could've made a better cheesesteak even though I've never even attempted to. Sorry to say but this place is really a load of crap. big loaf of bread, 2 maybe 3 slices tops of tasteless dried beef , and provolone that just never melted, which shows how not hot their meat were. I have a theory, with all the racist posters posted at this place, it must be that since they see that you're clearly not Caucasian, they'll serve you the crappier stuff so you're less likely to come back. That's the only way this place can still be open with the crap they serve. This place really gets you with all those flashy lights, but that's all they have going for them. unless you're into cardboard and cold bread, this place can definitely skipped."
7885,9,3,1,4/5/2010,"(Continuing from my cheesehunt hunt review.) Geno's was the second cheesesteak place my friends and I went to on our cheesesteak hunt. You can't miss this place because it's right across from Pat's and they both have colorful lights blasting so if you miss it, you've got problems. Anyways.. Geno's in my opinion is way overrated. They made my cheesesteak in like 3 seconds (I had the cheesesteak with whiz) and not only was the bread either stale or just hard as hell, but the meat itself was a bit dry... I was pretty disappointed. I expected to be blown into the sky after eating their cheesesteaks but instead I got a frown on my face instead. :( My only question is.. why all the hype? Cause celebs ate here before? Right. Well, why don't you head over to Jim's Steaks and let them show you what a real cheesesteak tastes like."
7886,9,2,1,3/31/2010,"Having lived in Philadelphia for 2 years, I've had the chance to get some pretty great steaks. ˜I must say, after trying steaks around the city, Geno's is among my least favorite. ˜The steak is usually pretty dry, the staff is pushy and it is always over crowded as it's a tourist trap. I recommend finding your steaks at vendors or the steak place on South Street (can't recall the name)."
7887,9,3,1,3/31/2010,"Stopped here on a drive from VA to PA and tried Geno's and Pat's at the same time. Overall I preferred Geno's but I suspect they're more famous for their rivalry then their cheesesteaks. Next time I'm going to try another local and compare, but for this I wanted to try Geno's and Pat's. Geno's steak was sliced, not chopped and I preferred the flavor. Pat's was a little dried out and this was juicier. I got both of my cheesesteaks ""wit"" which mean ""with onions"". and got american cheese. The bread and the onions was similar and overall the cheesesteaks were very similar. I thought they were a little overpriced at about 8.50 each, but I guess you're paying somewhat for the name. Geno's wins the redneck signage contest and it was entertaining to see things like ""This is America, order in English"" all over the place."
7888,9,3,1,3/30/2010,"Went to Philly over the weekend and how could I not drop by Geno's after all the hype. ˜ And that's exactly all it was, HYPE! ˜ The line was long but moved along quickly. ˜Pats was accross the street and the line there was just as long. ˜It was a chilly day outside. Got to the first window and ordered a wiz and two provolone. ˜Went to the second window and ordered two diet cokes, ice tea and two cheese fries. ˜ Didn't add any condiments and ate it as was... nothing special. ˜Nothing special at all. ˜Taste no different than any other Philly Cheese Steak you can get anywhere. ˜Like I said, it's just the HYPE! I should have gone to Pats! ˜Two hour drive from NYC for this? ˜ I gave it three stars for being decent enough to feed my hunger. ˜The funny thing is that usually when people are hungry, food seems to taste better, yet this still just tasted okay."
7889,9,3,1,3/30/2010,"it's a good cheese steak, but eating it immediately after eating at Pat's makes it not as good. ˜Granted, they gave me more substance than Pat's, the flavor wasn't as good. ˜It's still better than the cheese steaks we have here in California though ˜ =\"
7890,9,1,1,3/29/2010,"Was visiting a friend in jersey and decided to drive to philly for their famous cheesesteaks. Went to Geno's who had a LONG line thinking it must be good. Boy were we WRONG! This cheesesteak had nothing special about it! the bread is not even toasted or warm and tasted like plastic! It did not taste good at all! i don't know why people like it at all or why philly is known for their cheesesteaks. NY has better cheesesteaks in my opinion. And to top this place off.. if you're not white, they make it pretty clear, they don't like to serve you! signs everywhere about only speaking english. Posters of minorities who have gunned down white people. Please don't go to this place and support such garbage!"
7891,9,4,1,3/29/2010,"I briefly stopped through Philly with my boyfriend and one of his friend's who is a native to the city.Since I never had a cheese steak before, and once absentmindedly asked my bf ""What kind of meat is in a cheese steak?"", it was decided that we must go to Geno's. Located directly across from Pat's, tourists and natives alike lined up in the streets (much to the chagrin of those driving on those streets) to sample this beefy treat. The line moved quickly, which gave me enough time to be nervous about properly ordering (I must've repeated ""whiz with"" over and over about 100 times). Fortunately, I found one of the few open patio tables and went to claim it while I avoided the ordering ordeal. Lucky for me and my hungry belly, Geno's churns out the cheese steaks like they do patriotic propoganda so I didn't have to wait long. The cheese steak itself was a lot more wieldy than I imagined, with a great bun-to-meat ratio. My first bite exposed me to two of the most important food groups - cheese and grease - and oh my, was it yummy. Watch out for errant cheese whiz or else you might be wearing it, which I assume would be a badge of pride in Philly. I ate with my face 5 inches from the table the entire time to avoid a cheese whiz mishap as I gobbled up that sandwich; finding no shame in licking my fingers to savor the greasy residue left behind. The bun was fresh, the grilled onions superb, and I am super happy I didn't get pretentious with my sandwich and order provolone cheese over the cheese whiz. Overall, I give this place a yum-yum in my tum-tum. I'll be back in Philly for said native's wedding, and while I loved Geno's, I might try Pat's to see if the deliciousness holds up."
7892,9,3,1,3/27/2010,"3 stars is for the food only. They taste good but I find Pat's a bit better (see the review). ˜I don't appreciate the whole English only thing, I mean please. Last time I check Italians didn't speak English when they got here so what's the deal? Like I said in my other review ironic b/c it's Philly, the city of brotherly love."
7893,9,4,1,3/26/2010,"Geno's does put in more effort 2 attract attention and customers. ˜Flashy neon signs and celebrity pics around the store area nice touch. ˜on my way back from Virginia, I wanted 2 try Genos since I tried Pats on the way down. ˜ First of all, Genos staff is nicer, they are more tolerant of hessitant customers, confused peeps or anyone with a couple of Qs. ˜Usually has a shorter line than Pats so u will get ur food faster. ˜Just like Pats, ur cheese steak will b ready in a mere seconds after u order. ˜Menus are basically identically 2 Pats. ˜price is also nearly the same. ˜ When it comes down to the cheese steak itself, it is very good. ˜It just falls a lil short of the taste of Pats. ˜Pats and Genos seems 2 b like the Lan EVO vs WRX STI, EVO is generally accepted as a lil better but pretty close. ˜i dont know why im comparing cheese steaks with rally cars, it just seemed like a very accurate if not odd metaphor. ˜If any of yall think otherwise, let me know. ˜ In conclusion, i also think Genos avg score is 2 low. ˜It is very good in its own right, but got tuff competion on the other side of the street. ˜Overall though, I think they have executed a very successful business model. ˜props 2 Geno's, but they r #2 on the block."
7894,9,1,1,3/24/2010,Not worth going out of your way.
7895,9,3,1,3/23/2010,"Went here for lunch last Sunday (3/14/10) After eating the first cheesesteak from Pat's, I walked across the street to Geno's to try theirs. ˜The signage is very over the top, very bright and colorful, lots of lights. ˜They have pictures of celebrities posted around the front and I even saw a stripper's model picture there too (mad props for that one). ˜The guys who worked there were nice, it seemed like a clean-cut type of place. The price of the cheesesteak was about the same as Pat's, around $8. ˜I ordered a cheesesteak with onions and cheese whiz. ˜The steak was not chopped but sliced. ˜The onions were nicely grilled. ˜When I took my first bite, I thought it was good but not as good as Pat's. ˜The steak wasn't nicely seasoned as Pat's was and the cheese whiz was a bit watery. ˜The roll was also good but soft all around, not as crunchy as Pat's. ˜I ended up only eating one-third of the cheesesteak from Geno's and my wife ate another third of it. ˜I'm glad that I was able to try the Geno's cheesesteak but the next time I'm in Philly, I'm only going to Pat's. ˜Between the two Cheesesteak rivals, the service and price are very comparable but the flavor/taste goes to Pat's on this one. But if you never had a cheesesteak from either joint and you're in Philly, I suggest you try both and decide which one is the best...it's the best way to find out for yourself."
7896,9,2,1,3/20/2010,"This is definitely a tourist stop must if your going/passing through Philadelphia. I got the vibe that they don't like tourists so I would advise to order like a local. To get the standard cheese steak you must say, ""Give me one Whiz with"" Basically it consists of Italian bread, Grade D meat, Cheese Whiz and grilled onions. Its tasty but next time I think I'm going across the street to Pat's Cheese Steaks, I've heard they are better."
7897,9,3,1,3/20/2010,"I wasn't impressed at all, then again I like provolone on my cheese steak. ˜Parking is a pain, but I did get right next to the place. ˜I lived outside Philly for five years and never tried the place until this year when I went back for a visit. ˜Geno wasn't mean though. ˜The line went quickly but dang the parking. ˜(I'm from California, I can't parallel park on the left!!!!) ***I must admit though that I went up to order and was like, ""UH... I don't know how to order."" ˜And they did not yell at me. ˜But I was smiling."
7898,9,1,1,3/19/2010,"Like most tourist cheesesteak places in the city, the meat just sits around for hours on the grill not getting any fresher. I would rather they spend the money from all those lights on some garbage cans across the street, toilets for drunk patrons ˜at 3am, or some better ingredients. If the xenophobic signs and confederate flags don't make you lose your appetite, then the exploitation of dead cops will. If you need to eat here, go across the street, but if you want a great steak, go to Cosmi's. Then again, you're probably drunk and don't care."
7899,9,4,1,3/19/2010,"In the never-ending war between Geno's and Pat's cheesesteaks, I declare Geno's the victor. ˜Geno's reigns supreme to me because they don't chop up the meat and it is significantly less greasier than Pat's. ˜The one-star deduction comes from the gaudy exterior and arrogant attitude. ˜My recommendation: just get your cheesesteak and run!"
7900,9,4,1,3/19/2010,"Like all others...I had to do the tourist thing and go here. Well, I don't think I had a choice as I was in Philly at 12midnight and Geno's and Pat's were about the only two cheesesteak establishments open that late (to my knowledge). Myself and two other buddies had agreed to buy one cheesesteak from each place and cut it into thirds for a little taste test. We got regular cheesesteaks w/ no additives. I'll just put it this way...it was close, but by majority vote we went back to Geno's to buy one of our own. I think the bread really was the deciding factor from Pat's. Tourist spot or not...this place is a must-go when you visit Philly just for the experience alone."
7901,9,2,1,3/18/2010,We came here and tried head to head with the other place across the street and I must say it did not hold up yo the king. ˜I now it's all about personal preference so you got to figure it out on your own. ˜I will say that I am not a fan of thin sliced meat and the onions were not good at all. ˜Next time it's to the other side.
7902,9,1,1,3/15/2010,Awful. ˜The only place worse is across the street at Pat's. ˜If you're from Philadelphia - or have lived in Philadelphia - you wouldn't be caught dead at this intersection.
7903,9,5,1,3/11/2010,"As good as it gets for a sliced cheesesteak, although I prefer chopped, American, wit. 'Nuf said"
7904,9,4,1,3/9/2010,"AWESOME! ˜They are so good! ˜I have to admit, being a tourist, I was going to go to Pat's (yes, i have read that other places in the city are better, but for my first time I had to do the tourist thing, kinda like TGIFridays in Times Square). ˜I figured the line would be long, but Pats literally had a line wrapped ALL THE WAY around the building, and I was too hungry to wait. ˜So we went over to Geno's which had a smaller line. ˜I waited only about 20 minutes. One of the things I noticed was that the whole area was very clean. ˜I would not expect that from a place that churns out cheesesteaks nonstop. ˜I ordered 'whiz wit' to use the local term. ˜I wanted to go with the classic, and it was fantastic! ˜AWESOME! ˜I am thinking about it and getting the same desires as I get when i think of Shake Shack in NYC, or Grimaldis in Hoboken. ˜Just a yearning for....Yeah Im gonna have to make another philly run soon to get more. ˜My only regret, is that I should have ordered two or three (because they were that good and i am that fat!). ˜Hey, live and learn..."
7905,9,2,1,3/8/2010,Having never visited Philly before I had to stop and try from both Geno's and Pat's. ˜I ordered the exact same at both--cheesesteak wit onions and cheese whiz. ˜Since I had already eaten my Pat's first and loving every bite (at Pat's with no evidence of me being there) I approached Geno's for an order to take back on the plane. ˜The woman behind the counter was rude and not pleasant at all. ˜The food was okay but the service at Pat's was overwhelmingly positive compared to this place.
7906,9,2,1,3/7/2010,"I got the cheesesteak with whiz. It tasted pretty good, but I had a few problems with it. The steak was not chopped up like most other good steak joints. It was also expensive $8.25 for just the sandwich and $2.00 for a fountain drink. What a rip off! Did I mention the 30 minute line around the corner at 3pm in the afternoon. It's just not worth it. Oh and my stomach was ruined for the rest of the day. Without going into details let's just say I wasn't able to make it out last night. Carmine's is better and so is Lorenzo's right around the corner."
7907,9,3,1,3/5/2010,"I haven't been here in awhile but that sign that says speak English when ordering sort of bothers me. Moving along...I love coming here in the summer and sitting at the tables outside. I can stare at the many celebrity photos proudly posted on their table surfaces (and hung up on the walls) that have come here to enjoy a fabulous cheesesteak. Definitely more seating here than Pat's...which is why I like to come here with friends. And it is more eye-catching. Yeah, the people can be rude but clearly we're not here for the service. With mushrooms and wiz please!"
7908,9,2,1,3/5/2010,"i am not a fan of cheesesteaks but when i first moved to philadelphia i had to try it out to see what i've been missing and what these famous cheesesteaks were all about. i did not like the way they cut the meat since they were bigger slices, it made the meat a bit tough and harder to bite into. and on top of this, the people who work here are extremely rude which made it even harder to enjoy their cheesesteaks."
7909,9,3,1,3/3/2010,Like a moth to a flame I can't resist the allure of the flickering neon gods. I recommend the basketball shoe wit wiz.
7910,9,3,1,2/25/2010,"I liked it. The meat was well cooked and I think i got a perfect version of their cheese steak. I could do with more flavor though. I personally prefer the non Philly Philly cheese steak with white cheese and grilled onions and peppers. The cheese fries were pretty damn good though. I didn't go to Pat's but i would venture to guess they are exactly the same. It was a good value and I'm glad I can say I went here, It was a cool experience."
7911,9,1,1,2/20/2010,"My girl and I were in town, and decided to try one sandwich from Genos, and one from Pats. ˜Neither place was really more polite or had a shorter line or better seating. ˜In fact, at Pats we had to sit with another couple who told us they would never go to Genos because the owners are racist. ˜Anyhow, politics aside Genos doesn't even deserve one star based on the quality or lack thereof rather, of its sandwiches. ˜If you must decide for yourself don't ask for peppers on yours, because they're incredibly sweet and will dominate over every other component. ˜If you're in the neighborhood there's no reason not to just stick with Pats. ˜If you're willing to make a journey to find the actual best cheesesteak in town, go to Tony Lukes. ˜Far superior in every way. ˜Also, no tourists. ˜Just cockamayme Phladelphia locals."
7912,9,1,1,2/16/2010,"I hate to give this one star because it deserves negative stars for the rude treatment I got tearing into a rival's cheesesteak after eating theirs on their seats. I swear I could have ordered in Korean while wearing a Free Mumia shirt and wouldn't have gotten the dirty looks, finger wagging, and head nodding I got from behind the glass. I mean, if two people are going to trying to find out who's best and it's cold/rainy out, where did they expect us to sit? That's just cruel. Xeno's, I mean Geno's, is perfect for tourists who like having Food Network/Travel Channel force-feed what they should try to eat in Philly. It's a unoriginal pile of Wiz and possibly onions on Amoroso bread, nothing more, nothing less. Frankly, I've gotten a better cheesesteak in DC to be honest. Do it once to say you ate there, then never go back!"
7913,9,3,1,2/13/2010,"I'm not going to lay down esoteric comments about a cheesesteak ˜since it's not a pretentious food. I'm a Philly native that had never had the Geno's experience. Shameful as it may be, I've finally joined the club. In short: Delicious, soft bread layered with thin slices of steak, whiz, and chopped onions. The perfect ""junk"" food for a cold Saturday. The line moved quickly and we managed to avoid getting yelled at by putting our order in correctly. I didn't think the fries were anything special - good, but I'd probably skip them next time. I was surprised at how much I like the mix of flavors considering whiz just seems disgusting on any other food. I can see why these steaks are the cuisine of choice for tipsy college kids."

That's what a co-worker and I hoped to resolve when we made the quickest pit stop ever en route to catching our train out of the city. ˜Pat's. ˜Geno's. ˜Quite simply, a LOT of beef, cheese whiz, and bread to put down--all in 20 minutes. ˜(Luckily, there were no lines this Thursday evening.) First was Pat's. ˜$8.25 for a cheesesteak with whiz, no onions/pepeprs/etc. ˜Soft, yet crisp, fresh bread--nice. ˜Pleasantly surprised at how well the whiz worked. ˜But the meat, served in rough chunks, was a little tough and not that flavorful. ˜Good, but onto Geno's... Geno's. ˜I was wary of this place's reputation for in-your-face politics. ˜The ""Take Back Our Country"" signs were a little eyebrow-raising, but beyond that, nothing crazy. ˜Plus, this steak was damn good. ˜The meat here was neatly sliced, properly cooked, and well seasoned. ˜My co-worker raved about the hot sauce he loaded onto his. I understand that Pat's & Geno's are considered tourist traps by Philly natives, but nonetheless, definitely worth checking out for the history. ˜Pat's vs. Geno's? ˜One man's opinion: advantage, Geno's."
7916,9,1,1,2/1/2010,All the glitz and glam and for what? A sub-par cheese steak that isn't any better than what I'd find at a Subway. I was driving from DC to NYC and stopped in Philly to find this place (and Pats) and was seriously disappointed. Pats stinks too but Geno's really loses points because they over compensate with all the neon. Best cheese steak...The Cheese Steak Shop in San Francisco. I've tried a lot of cheese steak and the one on 1716 Divisadero is the best.
7917,9,2,1,1/29/2010,"If you're into bright lights, then this is the place to go. ˜There'll be a line just like Pat's buttttttt it won't be as long and it'll move faster. ˜But in the end, is it really worth it???

7918,9,1,1,1/22/2010,"Julia So I finally give a one star yelp. ˜I wasn't looking for this place but happened to drive passed it and knew of the great Pat's versus Geno's cheesesteak battle. ˜Had to stop so I did. ˜But which place to choose, which line to go on.... ˜Geno's is much more gaudy with the neon lights and maybe that's what sold me. ˜The line's were about the same as I was hoping to use that as a gauge to determine who was better. ˜Even while waiting, I asked the patrons around me, which one was better.... ˜but I think everyone was a tourist, not that I'm a tourist in Philly, but it sure isn't my town....

7920,9,1,1,1/20/2010,"these are the sandwiches which are served in purgatory -- so blase and meh, I can't even write the indifferent review it deserves. ordering a sandwich with the works didn't make a difference. the meat was mediocre and sparse at that, and the company it shared was no better. the ass-faced clown who made the sandwich (yes, really, it does look like a circus with a carnie cast doin' it up in the kitchen) must have just opened up a room-temperature can of good ol' Pennsylvania Dutchman mushrooms and plopped it right onto the dry, granny-like labia that is called ""steak"". and about the cheese: I never thought that I would be saying this, but... WHAT CHEESE? and the sauteed onions were cooked so that the only experience you get with the onions is a visual one. they might as well have cubed the paper that the sandwich is served in and cooked it in fry grease -- would have tasted better. perhaps if they invested more of their money into their product rather than what could only be a ridiculously exorbitant electricity bill, I could write at least once nice thing here instead of rambling on like an ass-chapped food gremlin."
7921,9,1,1,1/18/2010,"I chose not to eat here for many reasons. To name a few, the place is covered in neon lights. If that doesn't say, GIVE US BUSINESS, then I don't know what does. Oh, and the place is way too ""Americana"" for my liking. They still call French fries ""Freedom"" fries. Really? That was stupid in 2001. It's even dumber now. And the whole thing about only speaking English when ordering.. Uh, you're in Philly. Know your demographic, jerks."
7922,9,2,1,1/18/2010,stop #3 very flaming. flames everywhere. ˜lots of photos of celebs. ˜memorials of cops and officials. the meat is once again dry. ˜it's not salty.. their hot sauce looks mild because it has a creamy orange color to it. but it is actually quite the opposite. ˜it just tastes like chili oil. ˜burns! that kind of hot sauce has no flavor and isn't good with the cheesesteak. something like tapatio or tabasco woudve been better.

7924,9,1,1,1/14/2010,"I. Love. Philadelphia. Period. But I hate that we're known for Geno's. Oh Geno's. I'm sorry I took more than five seconds to order. I didn't realize you were ACTUALLY doing me a favor by taking my hard-earned money (that's right, you're not the only people who work for a living) in exchange for shitty service and shittier food. Though I admit, at least your hot sauce is good. But you didn't make that, and I served it to myself. This place is the EZ Bake Oven of cheese steaks. I swear. Except EZ Bake products are vaguely intriguing - especially since I can't bake for shit. There is nothing intriguing about something that takes five minutes to slap together. I'm not saying cheesesteaks aren't great. Hell, Philadelphia born and raised, right here, son! In fact, my mom's cheesesteaks, which people tell me are quite good (I tend to stay away from my mom's cooking cause she's my mom) put me through college. That and tons of financial aid. But I digress. Because of this, I can actually say that in my lifetime I've made at least fifty steaks from scratch. It's not hard. In fact, it's one of the easiest things you can do. By a hunk of top round and chip it. Pan fry it in some oil. Add the onions last, or they'll overcook. Scrape it into a pile the length of the bread you're using, spread good 'ole American white on top so that it melts, and then put the bread on top. Spatula underneath, flip it over, and you're done. You've got an ""American wit,"" or, for the uninitiated, a ""cheesesteak with American cheese and onions."" Do they do this at Geno's? ˜No. The meat was cooked, to be sure. ""When"" is the question. If I knew I could get so much business putting under-salted beef jerky on yesterday's roll, skipping the courtesy of melting the cheese altogether, and charging eight bucks for the whole thing, I'd have skipped college and started my own steak empire so that Philly natives could hate my guts. I know it's 3am, and I know you're hungry. If that's worth a trip to South Philly to deal with all the other drunk, pissed off people, you might as well go home and sleep it off. Go to D'Alessandro's. They actually care about the people they serve. AND they have a respectable selection of bottled beers. One last thing: If they're called ""Freedom Fries,"" does that mean they come from ""Freedomland?"""
7925,9,4,1,1/13/2010,"We love Geno's. ˜I've been taking my son before or after Phillies games for 10 years. ˜We always look for a reason to stop by. ˜ Most folks think the chipped beef from a freezer make a steak sandwich. ˜The real slices of meat on this sandwich are what it is all about. ˜ If you come to Philly, stop a Geno's."
7926,9,1,1,1/13/2010,"Apparently this is a tourist trap and by far the worst steak sandwich I ever had. Had to wait in line forever, there was hardly any meat on my sandwich and it was very dry. I was not at all impressed by the taste and will not return on my next philly visit."
7927,9,1,1,1/6/2010,"Unless you're a tourist or a drunk clubber looking for a bite at 3am, avoid Geno's. ˜ This place survives on hype alone and it's a wonder its still in business. ˜First, the ""employees"" are horribly rude and impatient. ˜God forbid a tourist giving $$$ to your joint doesn't have the menu memorized by the time they reach the window. ˜Second, leave the political BS at the door. ˜Your job is to sell cheesesteaks, not push agendas. ˜ Third, the food is eh at best. ˜The steak is undercooked and the bread is flat. ˜My advice to management would be to buy better steaks. ˜ Save your money and go to Tony Luke's instead or one of the many cart vendors in the city. ˜For $2.50, you can get a cheesesteak far better than the garbage they serve at Xeno's. ˜Hypocrites.

I mean Geno's. ˜No matter which direction you go, if the angles are right, you can see the glare and signage of Geno's for blocks away. ˜This place is obviously famous, obviously full of tourists, and obviously an inferior cheesesteak option. The steak is grizzle. ˜Take a look at the grill through the window next time. ˜You can see about 20 pounds of meat pre-cooking. ˜That's right -- Your steak is not made to order. ˜Boo! ˜The bread is boring and bland. ˜The actual size of the sandwich isn't that big comparatively. ˜It also tastes much worse than better options. ˜The hot sauce available at the sidewalk stand is pretty hot and good though. Do you speak English? ˜Good, because that's the only language allowed here. ˜Plus the delivery is downright obnoxious. There's really no need to go here unless you want to say you've been to Geno's.

7929,9,3,1,1/4/2010,Nothing special here. ˜I've had comparable Philly Cheesesteaks all over the country and this one has nothing special to it.
7930,9,2,1,1/3/2010,"So finally trying the challenge I believe Pat's have the edge over Geno's. Geno's meat is a little more dry and tough. It's not to say that it's awful, but I do suggest you try both with a friend so you can have half of his/hers and vice. There's nothing anyone can sway you to get one over the other. The flashing lights and the celebrity pictures and sponsors might send you to Geno's but it's to each their own pleasure. I was even told a Chinese Take Out restaurant might have an even better cheesesteak... now that's left up to another venture for me."
7931,9,2,1,1/1/2010,"Get ready to chew on grizzle.... save your money... and if you have to have a steak instead of going down south st then... walk your ass across the street to Pat's ... save your money.... Geno's isn't ""The Kings of Steak"" now are they? There's a reason why Pat's is.... go there or follow me to South Street for the real steaks..."
7932,9,3,1,12/28/2009,"Being from the other side of the country, I didn't really get what all the hype was about. Cheesesteaks? We had tri-tip sandwiches and things of that nature that I liked just fine. So when I moved here, the idea of some sort of fast food steak shop just wasn't appealing. The first time I tried it was during my first summer in Philly. It was hot and sticky outside, I wasn't used to the heat, and then we had to go get some greasy steak sandwich that I wasn't even in the mood for. I had one bite and thought I'd hurl. I didn't go back for two years, until about a month ago. It was probably 3AM and nothing else was open. We were drunk and hungry, and this place was open. My guy friends love it, so I decided to have one too since I was out of options. HOLY MOLY. The steak was ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD. I put salt and pepper on mine, and that seemed to be enough. I ate it just like that. The combination of it being kind of cold outside and the steak being REALLY hot kind of made my life. The bread was amazing. Just what my alcohol-filled stomach ˜needed. I think I'll go back here next time I have the drunk munchies at 3 AM."
7933,9,5,1,12/26/2009,"Drove all the way from DC to see what the big hoot was about... GENO'S was AWESOME! Cooked perfectly, seasoned impecably... it was worth the 3.5 hour drive and standing in line in 20-something degree weather (we're from Miami, we were dying!) Loved it and can't wait to go back on my next trip to DC!"
7934,9,2,1,12/26/2009,"The only reason I went back to Geno's after so many years was because it was roughly 1:30am on Dec 26 and Pat's was closed. I was a Geno's fan for years simply because I'd been there more and was afraid to really venture over to the other side. At one point I did though, and haven't looked back. Let's cast aside the fact that Vento (owner) himself is overwhelmingly political (not sure when making sandwiches gave you the authority to be a spokesperson for ridiculous conservative patriotism), egotistical (the man has an ridiculous amount of photos and a cardboard cutout of HIMSELF plastered everywhere on the corner and at a property they own across the street) and obnoxious (I've been around long enough to see the transformation from regular Geno's to Tokyo/Las Vegas Geno's). Tell me one thing, why the hell isn't the steak chopped? Geno's leaves you with long slabs of meat. Every damned other cheesesteak shop in Philly chops their steak. No, it's not cute Geno's. It makes sense. You know why? The steak is easier to eat that way. When the steak is chopped it creates a nice mixture between itself and the cheese. Jeez, you're doing it wrong. Now, I'm no Pat's fanboy by any means - though if you're right there between the two, please opt for Pat's... unless it's a holiday and they're closed. Then again, both of these places are pretty much just for tourists. Though, their addictive qualities are undeniable."
7935,9,3,1,12/20/2009,"I was a tourist in Philly, so I went to both Pat's and Geno's. In my opinion, this place was not the better one. ˜In fact, I did not really care for either place. ˜I thought that they were both overrated. ˜I've had better cheesesteaks at Philly Connection. I think Geno's tries to hard. ˜It has more lights than the Vegas strip and uses that to lure in the tourists. ˜However, they have much better customer service than Pat's."
7936,9,3,1,12/16/2009,"Yea, you know what, Geno's IS better than Pat's, as I discovered during Kanan Across America (KananAcrossAmerica.blogs?). ˜I think the key, however, is to not eat your cheesesteak right away, you have to let some time pass so that the liquidy cheese whiz turns solid bonding the meat together. Pro-Tip: Have fun ordering in other languages! :P"
7937,9,1,1,12/16/2009,"PHILADELPHIA The great debate over who has the better cheesesteak, Pat's or Geno's just adds to the marketing hype that benefits both long time establishments. ˜Since they are located across the street from one another, you know you're going to end up trying both. My 1 star rating speaks for itself. ˜Geno's is greasier and the bread seemed cold and stale. ˜This country could easily resolve it's fossil fuel energy crisis by recycling all the oil that runs off the sandwiches at Geno's. My recommendation is skip Geno's and go to Pat's (or Tony Luke's as my friends from Philly recommend). Cheers! N."
7938,9,3,1,12/12/2009,"Geno's is good, but the other joints in town have this place beat. ˜The cheesesteaks appear to be smaller than normal. ˜The rolls are also a little bit tougher as well. ˜The meat here is also sliced versus being diced if you're into that sort of thing. ˜I prefer the beef in my cheesesteaks diced and grilled until there is a nice crisp flavor. ˜While good, there's better."
7939,9,3,1,12/8/2009,"Geno's to me is far better than Pat's. ˜Got the cheese steak with provolone, it was good. ˜Nothing special."
7940,9,4,1,12/8/2009,"So this was my first time in Philadelphia and all that was on my mind was getting a good Philly Cheese steak, and also see sites from Always Sunny, but that's a whole other story. From what my roommates and I heard, the best place to get the sandwiches were from either Geno's or Pat's. I was quite surprised to see the two competitors just on opposite sides of the street from each other. I had a hard time deciding which place to try but I finally chose Geno's for reasons I do not know. What did I think? It was delicious; however, i could have used a little more meat and it was pretty pricey, but the same could be said for Pat's. Mu got a sandwich from Pat's with provolone cheese and it tasted really good, and there was a generous amount of meat in the sandwich. If I had to choose all over again, it would be Pat's."
7941,9,3,1,12/8/2009,"What can I say that hasn't been said? ˜It was good. ˜Not great, but we didn't go expecting great. ˜We heard all the warnings - how to order, etc. ˜ So overall, we got what we expected, the myth of Geno's. ˜The surly service. ˜The tasty bread. ˜The hot cheese. ˜Ultimately, it hit the spot. ˜I am sure others can do a cheese-steak, but you don't get the show. ˜ It was worth the drive."
7942,9,4,1,12/8/2009,"If I had to pick between Genos and pats Ill take genos by a slight margin. Heres why I liked the chopped steak at genos and the soft bread that held it all together, barely I must say. I docked them some stars here because the cheese was so hot that it melted the sandwich and I couldnt keep it in one peace. I know, I should eat faster but I wanted to enjoy this! Also the owner is a bit of an ass, but thats kinda his schtick so I guess he has to act the part for the tourists."
7943,9,1,1,12/7/2009,"Didnt even try the place because of the DISGUSTING signs, tshirts, and displays of racism. To the people of color that frequent this place -- please do not!!!

GO TO PAT'S ACCROSS THE STREET AFTER YOU ARE WASTED ONE NIGHT. do go there to take pictures and bring them back to people -- they wont believe their eyes. BOYCOTT THEM PLEASE."
7944,9,1,1,12/1/2009,"I actually liked the thicker meat and the crunchier bread in my cheesesteak better than Pat's. But the onions were barely cooked. Overall the sandwich was better, probably because we asked for provolone instead of cheese wiz too... Now where Geno's loses all the stars I could give him is the xenophobic crap on the windows. I completely understand the memorial for Philly cops and firefighters killed in the line of duty but ""Order in English, this is America"" is really douchy."
7945,9,3,1,11/29/2009,"Went to Philly for a day of sight-seeing. ˜We did the usual, Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell. ˜Also on the list, an authentic Philly's cheesesteak. ˜So naturally the first place we chose was Geno's. Prepared for the cold weather, we ventured to South Philly and waited in line, which was out in the middle of the street, Literally!!! The big neon sign displaying Geno's Steaks is prominent. ˜And so is the smell of steak wafting through the air. ˜They were clearly popular! ˜The line was fast, considering it was a saturday during lunch rush. ˜We pulled up and ordered two steak sandwiches with onions for around $16. ˜The next window down we ordered cheese and ""freedom"" fries (really? ˜Freedom fries?) ˜in any case we were ready to eat. ˜ The sandwich was tasty, steak is cooked well, cheese-whiz was good, not over powering, the bread chewy in texture, which went well with the texture of the steak. ˜ This place is good if you want to eat at a place synonymous with pop culture. ˜Their devotion to their political ideals is a bit much, but respected. Good steak! ˜Interesting place."
7946,9,2,1,11/25/2009,"I ventured to philly specifically for the cheesesteaks. I know, how very foodie of me. But I digress. So I ordered a cheesesteak from Pat's and one from Geno's. ˜Seriously, one was equally as mediocre are the other. Ive had better cheesesteaks in Los Angeles, Miami, hell, even Georgia! ˜This city has a serious love affair with cheezewhiz.... only the good Lord knows why."
7947,9,1,1,11/25/2009,"Downright terrible. Their bread is the only thing that's worth eating. ˜The meat is bland and tough. If you end up in this neighborhood for cheesesteak, go across the street to Pat's."

Okay, sure there is a lot to be said about quickness and to, move on, but honestly if something can be done that quickly, honestly it cant be that good. The bread was stiff and cold, the steak looked very dry, just plopped on with some onion and cheese. meh. And the cheesesteak still runs about $8 for some break some meat, some cheese. Also, don't be fooled by the Vegas style neon, Joey Vento has also been embroiled in years of over-zealous ""patriotism"", rather anti-immigration for a sign ""This is America, order in English"". If ideals matter to any of you, you'd think twice too."
7950,9,2,1,11/17/2009,I made a special stop here to try an authentic Philly Cheesesteak. Went on a weekday after lunch crowd and didn't have to wait at all for my sandwich. Had the Wiz Wit and it was just ok. I've definitely had better. I'm glad I tried it as I have always wanted to taste an authentic cheesesteak. Next time I'll just drive 2 miles from my house in San Francisco and have one that's even better.

7953,9,2,1,11/14/2009,"Ok...when In Philly a drive out to Genos & Pats at least once is mandatory (if you haven't been there before).

Only reason I came here was just to come for the sake of coming so I can say ""yeah, i've been there."". There is absolutely no reason for me to come back.

7956,9,2,1,11/8/2009,Got the Whiz Wit. I like the bread and onions at Pat's better. I also like the chopped steak at Pat's better. The guy who took our orders seemed like he was really sick of dealing with tourists.
7957,9,3,1,11/8/2009,"Their hot sauce is pretty darn hot. Not quite BW3's Blazin' hot, but it's a decent burn. I liked Pat's better, but only because I had it without the hot sauce. The Geno's hot sauce is so hot that it takes away from the taste of the steak. Had a Whiz Wit. Definitely didn't live up to the hype. It was ok, but DEFINITELY NOT $8.50 ok!"
7958,9,1,1,11/3/2009,"seriously. ˜wtf. ˜ the obvious success of Genos reminds me of the contemporary hip-hop music industry. ˜people put out utter CRAP that any 2-bit idiot could, yet somehow achieve success the likes of us will never see. FML."

Not a lot of meat, Not nearly enough cheese whiz. It was mostly bread. Their fries tasted like cardboard and their ketchup was stale or something."
7962,9,4,1,11/1/2009,I'm not a cheesesteak expert. ˜I loved every cheesesteak I tried in Philly. ˜This one was good because the line moved really quickly.

7965,9,5,1,10/22/2009,"A must see if you're in Philly if just for the experience. Rude service, racist propaganda, old school italian a la 1970's. Very near the italian market. Forget Pat's, it's gross. Go with Geno's and get the Cheese Whiz. Make sure you know what to order before you get to the window. The line moves super fast. Also know that you order and pay for only your cheesesteak order at the first window. You get your steak at that window too. The next window is for drink and fried and whatever else. You order and pay for that there separately. Don't screw this up!"
7966,9,3,1,10/22/2009,"Geno's Steaks are A-OK! Having missed Geno's the first time I vacationed in Philly, I knew i had to make it there this time around. As a tourist- I wanted to try Geno's. As a Yelper- I realized there were probably better options in town. I had to try for myself. Of all the cheesesteaks I tried in Philly, Geno's packed the least punch. It seemed light on the steak, light on the cheese, and heavy on the bread. HOWEVER, it was still a tasty ass cheesesteak and deserves at least 3 Stars!! You Philly Yelpers have it so lucky if you consider Geno's to be on the lower end of the 'cheesesteak totem pole'- because I'd love to have a place like Geno's where I'm from! Overall A-OK, light on the steak, light on the cheese, tourist destination #1."
7967,9,2,1,10/22/2009,"Everyone always says, ""When you go to Philadelphia, you HAVE TO GO to Geno's and Pat's"" ˜ Well during ˜my trip to Philadelphia, I WENT TO Tony Luke's, Pat's, and Geno's so I can honnestly say I have had the ""big 3"" in Philadelphia! Geno's was the worst out of the 3. ˜Their meat was just dry and didn't seem ""juicy."" ˜ The fries were okay, and it is hard to mess up a pepsi (dont worry, pepsi was the best part). ˜The guy at the window was just as i expected (from what people told me), simply Rude. ˜ The lights on the building are there to attact people, that will surely bring people there, because the food shouldn't. GO TO PAT'S (when you are near these establishments) though if in philly - GO TO TONY LUKE'S HANDSDOWN"
7968,9,2,1,10/19/2009,"Its been quite sometime since I tried Geno's, and there is a good reason for that. If you find yourself standing in front of Geno's walk across the street and order a whiz wit and a side of cheese fries from Pat's. Pat's is just the tastier of the 2 late night cheesesteak ˜kings, hands down."
7969,9,2,1,10/19/2009,Ok geno's is just another cheesesteak place in the capital of Cheesesteaks.... ˜If you want something that is decent and the lines are not long like the ones across the street at Pats. ˜ I will wait in the lines any day to get the cheesesteak from Pats over Geno's.
7970,9,2,1,10/19/2009,"Go to Pat's - it's just right across the street. At Geno's, the beef got cold real fast and the bread was semi-warm. The thing was so thin too. Pat's fills each sandwich with tons of hot beef with whiz that doesn't run! I'm stunned at the difference. The cheesesteak didn't taste bad, it was just colder and 1/2 the size of a Pat's. Oh, and one more thing... if you get a side of fries here, you WILL be disappointed. Pat's fries aren't soggy and are crispy and hot. I don't have anything to gain by promoting Pat's - just being honest."
7971,9,1,1,10/19/2009,"Sucked! Sandwhich wasn't good, the service sucked, the tables were really dirty and not worth all the hype don't let the bright lights draw you in. Take a trip to Tony lukes if you want the best!"
7972,9,4,1,10/15/2009,"I truly enjoyed my cheesesteak sandwich!! The ingredients were fresh, warm, and juicy! ˜ I do not have any negative comments about this place. ˜ This place is a bit more flexible than Pat's as far as what you may add to your sandwich. ˜ Love it just as much as Pat's."
7973,9,1,1,10/13/2009,"I was very disappointed first of all CASH ONLY! I had to go to an ATM that looked like it was broken, people were staring at me like they've never seen an african american female in line before and the steak was horrible, it want even hot, bread was hard and the steak wasn't even chopped it. I heard this place was racist. I'm not one to go around throwing around the race card, but I definitely did not feel welcome and most likely won't be back, being a native New Yorker just wanted to say I tried it. I'll try Pat's next time. I was tricked by the inviting bright lights."
7974,9,2,1,10/10/2009,"She Said..."" First of all, if your reading this b/c you want to decide whether to go to Genos or Pats steak( which is right across from Genos)....go to PATS!!!!! Its much better. Anyways, this place was not what i was expecting, after eating at pats i was expecting either the same or better since its their competition. Not so much...it downgraded for me. The steak was really thin and not chopped up like at Pats. The onions werent as great either, and the cheese didnt seem warm enough. The bread wasnt all that great either....sorry im just venting becasue Pats was amazing and i expected Genos to be THAT good too, but it wasnt. The fries werent good here either, they were kinda soggy-like. The only good thing was the coke."" He Said....""After reading all the reviews on Yelp saying that Pat's and Geno's were the same, I have to disagree. Geno's bread is harder and I didn't like that the steak wasn't chopped up. They did have coke which is a plus...but their fries weren't that good...tasted like dirty grease or something. We drove from Maryland to Philly just to eat lunch...and we even stood in line at Tony Lukes before we decided on Geno's...so sorry we tried and it was confirmed...Pat's was better."""
7975,9,2,1,10/7/2009,"I picked to try Geno's first rather than Pat because it was the ""Touristy"" thing to do when in Philly. I thought the sandwich was ok. The steak tasted like anything we can get here in CA. The good thing was that the bread was soft and not soggy like some that I have had."
7976,9,2,1,10/5/2009,"Hmmm... Eight bucks for a small, cold cheesesteak. The only reason I went to Geno's was because I was feeling ashamed of being the only resident of Philadelphia who hasn't eaten there. I ˜wanted to be able to answer the proverbial question of ""Pat's or Geno's?"". ˜My original plan was to pick up one cheesesteak from Geno's, one from Pat's, and then have a steak-off to determine the winner. But the lines were so long that I took my one puny steak from Geno's and peaced the hell outta there. Now don't get me wrong, it wasn't a BAD cheesesteak, it was tasty. I just wish it was 1.) served hot 2.) twice the size 3.) about 3 bucks cheaper. Next time I will check out Dalessandro's."
7977,9,3,1,10/5/2009,"Of course being from out of town I had to try both this and Pat's back-to-back to determine for myself which place really does have the best cheese steak in town. ˜After trying both, I'm at a draw - here's my two cents to the pot. Of the two, this place really stands out because of the flashy neon lights advertising their corner, the large lit-up picture of a cheesesteak that looked almost Photoshopped in the pictures I took, and the almost daylight brightness of the sitting area that makes eating there seem like the daytime no matter when you actually go. ˜ I actually liked the flavor of Geno's cheese steaks better than Pat's. ˜You can actually taste the sliced steak and sauteed onions without being overpowered with too much Cheez-Wiz unlike some other places. I can actually taste the meaty fattiness of the steak and the biting sweetness of the freshly sauteed onions, accentuated with just the right amount of cheesy-saltiness. ˜While the bread was chewier and didn't ""melt"" into the rest of the cheesesteak ingredients, the ratio of bread to filling was perfect to taste the fattiness/sweetness/saltiness blending into the mild flavor of the bread. ˜Unfortunately Geno's doesn't offer any other fillings (i.e. mushrooms, green peppers) but what they do offer does the job well. Beyond the Cheez-Wiz on the cheese fries, the fries were bland and unimpressive. ˜Go to Pat's if you want good cheese fries. ˜ Overall I'm at a loss at which place is better than the other. ˜Regardless of which one I end up at they each have attributes that make for good cheesesteaks, though they have other attributes that make them fall short in satisfying the hunger for the perfect sammich. ˜Perhaps I need to try the provolone cheesesteaks here for better evaluation and comparison."
7978,9,2,1,10/4/2009,"Yum. I love my South Philly cheesesteak. This one is good, but I prefer Pat's. I would have given it 3 stars, but the staff is so freaking RUDE and the limited outside table areas are not always kept very clean."
7979,9,3,1,10/1/2009,Everything is average here. ˜Yea go travel channel...you def. hyped this place up and made all the newbies come and spend their time and money! And then I went over to Pat's and wow...what a surprise!! ˜another average cheesesteak.... Go to Jim's for steaks. ˜That's all i will say.
7980,9,3,1,10/1/2009,"Read about all the rivalry between Geno's and Pat's. ˜My friend and I were starving, so like a couple of hungry flies, we 'flew' to the shop with the BRIGHTEST lights, which is Geno's. ˜Oh my, it looked like Vegas! Ordering was like an assembly line: ordered steaks with whiz on one queue and then cheese fries with drinks on another queue. ˜The steak was alright; I think the relish certainly made it better. ˜The food was pretty cold though. ˜Not sure whether I can blame it on the preparation or simply the colder weather when we were eating those sandwiches (I'm guessing that a sandwich can't get THAT cold in 5 minutes from getting it to eating it). ˜I can see how this place can be overrated, but as a hungry fly at that time, the steak (albeit cold) was good enough to me."
7981,9,4,1,9/30/2009,"If I could change my last name to Cheesesteak, I would. That being said, I was expecting Geno's to be better. ˜Maybe it's all that hype. ˜Really raises your expectations. I like Geno's enough, though the super finely sliced steak wasn't quite so satisfying. ˜I guess I like a more substantial steak. ˜Not chunky or hearty, just something that doesn't disintegrate in my mouth under the weight of all that cheese, onions and bread. I'd have to say Steaks on South is my favorite."
7982,9,2,1,9/30/2009,"This place is so overrated. ˜What a disappointment. ˜Luckily I started the evening right with a real cheese steak across the street at Pat's before getting one here. ˜The problem I had with Geno's version is the meat-to-bread ratio is way out of whack. ˜Seriously lacking on the meat actually. ˜Someone should tell Geno that it's called a cheese steak and not cheese bread. ˜Also luckily, I ended the evening with one and a half Jim's cheese steaks which surprisingly ended up being my favorite of the trio."
7983,9,2,1,9/28/2009,"Seriously, what is the hype about? The cheesesteaks are average (at best) with regular bread, regular meat, and cheese that tastes like processed nacho cheese. On top of that, the guy at the counter is SO RUDE. We sat near the window where guests were ordering, and we probably saw/heard 20 transactions. From these transactions, I gathered the following: 1. He's racist. NOT nice to Asians (even those that speak English PERFECTLY). There are a handful of signs that say ""This is America. Speak in English."" We asked him what the score was for the Eagles game (the game was playing on a TV right behind him), and he said ""I see cheesesteaks, I don't tell people what the scores are."" 5 minutes later, a Caucasian guy asked him the same questions, and he told him what the score was. He also gives out pens/souveniers, but not to Asian people. 2. He's rude. One guy asked for mushrooms on his cheesesteak, and he said they didn't have mushrooms. The guest paused for 2 seconds, and the guys goes ""so, do you want it or not? yes or no? make a decision? come on come on."" There was NO ONE behind this guest waiting to order... I don't know why he was in a hurry. I'll never go back here again!"
7984,9,2,1,9/27/2009,"I'm basically writing the same review for Pat's as I am for Geno's because they're basically the same restaurant. ˜Only the photos are different. ˜What's more, I was fairly unimpressed with either place. I was introduced to Pat's and Geno's in Rick Sebak's 2002 PBS documentary, Sandwiches That You Will Like. ˜Well, the cheesesteak at these two places I can't really say I liked. I had a ""provolone wit"" (i.e., cheesesteak sandwich with provolone cheese and grilled onions). ˜The bread was stale and the cheese not melted. ˜Frankly, I've had better cheesesteaks at the mall in Albuquerque (seriously!). ˜For a better cheesesteak in the Philly area, try Dalessandro's. ˜Or skip the cheesesteak and get a fantastic hoagie at Primo's!!! .... Maybe I should've had it with whiz. Of all the Rick Sebak documented sandwiches, Pat's and Geno's have been the only disappointments as of yet. ˜Still, these are both institutions in their own right, so I'm glad I came --- only because now I can say I've been here. Oh, and be prepared for ridiculously long lines and a long walk to find parking. ˜There is no indoor seating. ˜Tables outside only (if you can find a free table). ˜Also (and I don't mean this as a criticism) if you're not from the area, you may perceive employees' manner as rude. ˜It really isn't. ˜It's just part of the South Philly 'tude. ˜Just roll wit it. One thing I will take issue with: ˜this place had the gall to refer to their French fries as ""freedom fries"". ˜Please! ˜I can really do without that kind of xenophobic nationalism. ˜Please keep your politics off my dinner plate! ˜I won't be back."
7985,9,2,1,9/26/2009,My Aunt is moving to AZ so she wanted to get Geno's one last time. ˜ We waited in line for over 30 minutes. ˜$8 for a sandwich. ˜Cash only with a shady ATM across the street. ˜We bought multiple steaks that we were taking home but we couldn't get a bag. ˜My car seat now has some grease on it because of that. ˜There is a picture of the owner Joey with Sarah Palin in an outfit that I could only describe as an Alaskan flannel sarong. My steak ( provolone wit) tasted good but I won't go back unless I have a really good reason too.
7986,9,3,1,9/25/2009,"Which tourist trap is better? Eh, Pat's across the street is better. And damn these things are expensive."
7987,9,2,1,9/24/2009,"You can't give 2 and a haf stars on Yelp? ˜Because that's what I want to give it. Like everybody else in America, I've been hearing about Philly cheesesteaks my whole life. ˜So when I go to Philly this summer, of course we need to have one. ˜We arbitrarily pick Genos instead of Pat's because why the hell not. Did you know that up in Boston we have this same kind of sandwich, only we call it a 'steak and cheese?' ˜And we use real cheese...which is not a dig. ˜I liked it with the 'whiz.' ˜ It was good, ˜But it was nothing special. ˜The meat came from a big pile of already grilled shaved steak, as did the mushrooms we ordered. ˜It all tasted a little lukewarm. ˜ The roll was there. ˜ But at the same time, it's still a big, greasy sandwich and I was starving, so it was satisfying. ˜Mediocre, but satisfying. ˜And they did have some nice pickled hot peppers to add in, which made the sandwich lots better.

7988,9,2,1,9/23/2009,"Shame on me for being sucked into this tourist trap, filled with right-wing paraphanilia no less. ˜I'd heard mixed reviews about this place, and this was our last stop before catching our flight home. ˜I decided to do whiz wit this time around after learning the hard way and ordering provolone at another cheesesteak joint. First off, CASH ONLY. Second, these things are a whopping $8 apiece. Whoa. ˜The bread was really hard, almost reminiscent of pretzel bread or sourdough. Not what I was expecting. Plus, the meat was different. Not chopped up steak, but I believe this was ribeye meat. Definitely a first for me on a cheesesteak. ˜The onions weren't cooked either, boo! All in all, not very satisfying nor did it come close to living up to the hype. I've had better tasting in Denver! Really!"
7989,9,4,1,9/22/2009,"cant say its the best sandwich in town because i havent been to pats, but ill always say this...dont diss steak and cheez whiz until youve tried it. mocking those sandwiches is like being from california and hating in&out burgers. if you do, and someone hears you, they rope you up alongside one of the walls at geno's, physically castrate you, and force feed you the whiz until you give in. horrible sight."
7990,9,2,1,9/20/2009,"Tempted to give 3 stars cause of being able to witness an act of human kindness that you don't get to see that often.

7992,9,2,1,9/17/2009,"The hubby and I walked two miles from our hotel for a taste of the infamous Geno's cheesesteak. He had been there as a kid, and wanted to relive the experience. Geno's isn't hard to miss, being in an orange building with neon lights. The food delivery time was quick, but when I took a bite of my sandwich it was completely flavorless. All I could taste was bread with the occassional hint of provolone/grilled onions. It was also completely dry. Try somewhere else!"
7993,9,4,1,9/15/2009,I don't understand some of the low ratings. Their steaks tasted awesome. The meat and bread tasted wayy better than pats. Though pat's did have a better selection of toppings to go with your Philly steak. All the pictures are cool and the razzle dazzle lights all add to the experience. I would come back here and you should too!
7994,9,5,1,9/15/2009,Good cheese steaks at a good price!
7995,9,5,1,9/11/2009,"You know the deal with this place so I'll keep it short. You have to try it, along with Pat's, get both, they are right next to each other. ˜I prefer it with provolone, whiz is good too. ˜I like the bread better here, but they are less generous than Pat's with the meat."
7996,9,5,1,9/10/2009,Best Cheesesteak I have ever had. Quick service. Great staff. Geno still works 7 days a week. He was there and took pictures with patrons. Great stop!
7997,9,4,1,9/9/2009,"Yes, Geno's is a tourist trap and you will wait on a long line for a cheesesteak that probably won't live up to your expectations, but part of tourist traps are that they can be fun and offer a bit of local flavor, so here's my story of why I like Geno's. Obviously if you're going to a place that sells cheesesteaks with only a few variety of cheeses and toppings to put on, you'd think people would know how to order. Wrong. While waiting in line, a bold soul decided to test the waters by letting the counter guy at Geno's know he made a mistake. Here's how it went down. Customer right before I order: ""Excuse me, um you gave me the wrong sandwich, I wanted provolone and not American. Can I get another one? Counter Guy: You can PAY for another one. Customer (Cowering in fear) Okay okay okay (i.e. please don't kill me, take my wallet, my credit cards etc. etc.) Good cheesesteaks. Even better characters. Plus the pictures of owner Joey Vento with celebrities and the funny signs makes the wait much more bearable"
7998,9,2,1,9/7/2009,"Despite living around the corner from Geno's, I almost never go there. ˜I rarely hit Pat's either, but occasionally post-bar, I'll need food and have no other options. ˜But my cousin was in from out of town, and wanted to try the famous one, so I found myself at Geno's, mostly because the line was shorter. I had honestly forgotten just how stingy Geno's gets with the meat. ˜I think my sandwich had 2 slices of steak on it. ˜I also usually get whiz at the tourist traps, but decided against it when I saw the pile of pre-whizzed rolls behind the glass. ˜Sorry, the point of whiz is that the tourist traps are too lazy to melt the provolone or american into the meat while it's on the grill, so its the only hot, melted cheese you can get. ˜If it has time to cool down on the roll, it loses its only advantage and reveals just how disgusting it really is.. ˜So instead I got provolone, and the accompanying river of grease when I picked picked it up. ˜At least the roll was decent. I skipped the fascist fries, and failed to order in english (""provo wit"" would not please Mr. Webster). ˜I was surprised to find they don't even have sweet peppers available at the grill. ˜Basically, unless you have an out of town guest who wants to try the famous places, skip it for a better joint."
7999,9,5,1,9/7/2009,"I ordered it with provolone. ˜You can get cheez whiz or american instead. ˜You don't have to ask for onions because, as the cool ""kids"" know, I comes with them. ˜So, if you dont want them say something like ""provolone without."" ˜Seriously, though. ˜This cheesesteak is great. ˜Served on a slightly chewy hoagie style role, with onions and cheese, it is a delight. ˜Well worth the $8.00 ˜One size soda, one size fries.

8001,9,3,1,9/6/2009,"I've been to Geno's before, but decided to do a Geno's/Pat's taste test. So, I got a cheesesteak w/whiz and onions - or a whiz, wit (however you say that) from each one. Here's what you get at Geno's: soft bread that holds all it's contents without dominating them + thin steak, and the perfect amount of it + just the right amount of whiz = great blended flavors in a cheesesteak Geno's wins,. hands-down. I had 3 other people with me, and we all came to the same conclusion. It's just MY kind of cheesesteak which I'd gladly drive to get again."
8002,9,2,1,9/3/2009,"The steak was ok.... a little taste-less. Its the philly hype. Pat's is the same...its the hype. Cheese fries were good, just a little too filing. Lil Sicily's is the best in philly for a cheese steak. :)"

""UM, UH, UM I NEED UM, UH I NEED A CHEESTEAK WITH UM, UH THAT ORANGE CHEEZ STUFF"" tool behind counter is fuming right now....."
8005,9,3,1,8/24/2009,"Horrible ratings. I love it. I don't love Geno's. I love the fact that people aren't too keen on it and rightfully so. The line was longer than Pat's. They're slower. They take their time at Geno's and I don't mind because the guy who handled my steak and money wasn't dirty about it. I got a whiz wit onions and it wasn't so bad. Still not good. Since my steak at Pat's was flavorless this time I salt and peppered up my steak at Geno's. Geno's gives you less meat in the sandwich but other than that the sandwiches are similar. On to the next window which salavaged my cheesesteak experience- beverages! Geno's serves up the BEST FOUNTAIN SODA ever! It's on par with the filtered water from IN N OUT. I got a coke and it was perfect in every way. It was cold but my cup wasn't frosted. The carbonation had just the right amount of fizzies. And the sugar/water soda syrup ratio concoction was spot on. I always taste the sodas first when I'm filling my own cup at fast food joints. If it tastes watered down I pour it out and choose another. Geno's soda is excellent. And perfect for the hottest day in hell. It was a guilty pleasure and the best sin I engaged in that afternoon. Now that I've had Pat's and Geno's, I'll tell you who has the best cheesesteak. The Cheesesteak Shop in Berkeley, CA on University Ave. Those folks don't play around. They even check your 20's to see if they are counterfeit. I'm going to give Philly one more chance to redeem themselves. Jim's I am coming for you next time so get ready. And please chop up your steak because that's the way I like it."
8006,9,2,1,8/24/2009,"For a place that hypes itself up, Geno's cheese steaks are pretty bad (especially for the price). ˜I've had them a couple of times and I had one where the beef tastes like they marinated it in a bucket of fish. ˜If you are by Geno's, might as well go across the street to Pat's."
8007,9,5,1,8/21/2009,"Geno's was my first stop on a cheesesteak eating frenzy; I really should have ended the eating frenzy here, it only got worse. I like the fact that they don't chop the meat, and probably the shear fact that it was the greasiest cheesesteak made it the most delicious. I mean cheese whiz + grease= awesome saucy goodness! The lame signs didn't even take away from they goodness of the steaks."
8008,9,2,1,8/21/2009,"Geno's Steaks is really not that great. ˜Pat's is wayyy better. ˜However, sometimes, when Pat's is closed for a minute or has too many people in line, you have to go to Geno's. ˜There's nothing nice about Geno's- I keep going there at 3 am wasted, and eating cheese fries, and unfortunately for my body, cheesesteaks. ˜The salt that is dumped in the cheese fries is too much! Especially when you're already dehydrated from drinking all night. ˜Sometimes my neighbor is there working and it freaks me out. ˜My friend Mark likes Geno's better than Pat's, so when he's with me, we do Geno's. ˜He only likes Geno's because of the hot guy that power washes the sidewalks from 3-5am. ˜I really should stay away from here at these hours."

Sorry, just can't fall for this tourist trap. ˜Pats was better, but also dissapointing."
8011,9,4,1,8/19/2009,"4 for overall place but 3 in terms of a Philly cheesesteak place. The sandwiches here are standard prices ($7-8), all seating is outside on picnic tables under the awning. This is mostly a tourist attraction ˜with tons of flashing neon lights and framed celebrity photos eating the famed Geno's cheesesteak. There's a big debate over Pats vs. Genos (across the street from each other) but this debate is primarily among tourists and not natives who know of better places for a good cheesesteak. Props go to Pats though because they invented the cheesesteak and were around much longer. It's not that the cheesesteaks here are bad (they're actually quite good) it's just that they are smaller, less filled, and the lines are much much longer. If I remember correctly the steak is better at Pats and the rolls are better at Genos (or possibly vise versa) but you really need to go somewhere like Tony Lukes for something much better for the money."
8012,9,4,1,8/18/2009,"Though it's a tourist spot, I still highly recommend the cheesesteaks here. It's directly next to Pat's, which is the original cheesesteak in Philly. Very good cheesesteaks and cheese fries. The counter staff is not terribly patient, but they're not too bad. As a tip, to order a cheesesteak with cheez whiz (the preferred way) and with onions, you'd say ""one whiz wit"". Yes, you don't use the ""h"" in ""with"". If you don't want onions, it's ""one whiz witout""."
8013,9,2,1,8/17/2009,"I have a love/hate relationship with Geno's. Love it because, since I live down the street, it always seems like a good idea for a late night snack. Hate it for just about every other reason. Cheez whiz IS NOT FOOD. my stomach reminds me of this everytime I succumb to an order of cheese fries or whiz wit. Quite frankly, it makes me feel like shit. Sure, the rolls are soft and the meat is quality, but their food never fails to make me feel disgusting. The staff is rude, that's true, and everything else about Geno's is downright offensive. Blaring neon signs that blink at all hours of the night, loud patrons at 3am, trash strewn all over my block. Gross. If you're looking for your ultimate cheesesteak experience you might find it here, but I think skipping it is a better option. Your stomach will thank you."
8014,9,1,1,8/14/2009,"It was Horrible We had a Pat's-Geno's tasting and Pat's won HANDS DOWN. It was not even close (see review on Pat's) The sandwich was not even up to par to something from a 4th rate deli store Bread- COLD and chewy Steak- COLD and tasteless Provolone Cheese- COLD and not melted. I don't think the Cheez Whiz could have saved it We also ordered Cheese Fries and Coke and they gave us the WRONG order and refused to changed it! Who messes up CHEESE Fries? They gave us plain fries (which was the tastiest thing at that place, i guess) The sandwich was not even worth $1, let alone $8 Nasty. All the neon lights in the world can't save the sandwich"
8015,9,2,1,8/14/2009,"I liked it, but I've had better. Now my friends tell me I'm very over sensitive when it comes to racial issues. ˜And that may very well be true. ˜But I still did not like their sign that says ""This is America. ˜When Ordering Speak English."" ˜Although I've read that ˜Geno's says that they will not turn away any customer for having poor English, but then why have the sign up at all? ˜Some will claim patriotism, but there are ways to be patriotic and not offensive at the same time. ˜It just doesn't make sense to me. ˜The US is a country of foreigners. To me, for that sign to be correct, it should read ""This is America. ˜When Ordering Speak [Insert Native American Dialect Here.]"" ˜ It's just the sign makes me upset because of my parents mostly. ˜My parents are hard working blue collar Americans that immigrated here to give me a better life. ˜ And that sign is just sad and I can see my parents having a hard time ordering there and being sent to the back of the link for not ordering correctly. The cheese steak is good. ˜But I honestly find the the taste at Pat's and Jim's better. ˜Regardless of the sign. ˜And as they have their right to have to sign up, I have my right to not give them any of my patronage."
8016,9,1,1,8/11/2009,"Only thing cool about this place is the lighted signs. This place always has shorter lines than Pat's because the cheesesteak is not as good. It's by no means bad, but it's not that great. Cheese fries are not that great either. Plus the staff is EXTREMELY rude and they have racist signs posted on the walls discouraging immigrants and others who can't speak english. Are you friggin kidding me??? your parents/grandparents ancestors aren't immigrants from Italy?? Avoid this place, it blows."
8017,9,2,1,8/11/2009,"Definitely sub par to Pat's steaks. I tried both in a row, and there were a few things about Geno's that I was wary of from the start. They had signs posted everywhere saying ""English only,"" which was completely unnecessary and just rude. There was another sign around Geno's tables (can't remember the exact language) basically stating that only Geno's customers may sit down. In my opinion, there was no need for them to go to such lengths since Pat's was right across the way and had neither of those signs, even knowing that most people stop by to try both. The cheesesteak - not worth the time I spent waiting in line. The bread was correct (Philly bread that was so soft w/o falling apart), but the meat, which Geno's brags is better quality, was very chewy and had been fried in long strips. This means that when you bite into it, your teeth won't always cut the chewy meat properly, and you will end up dragging out a large piece of meat. I much preferred the meat at Pat's where they chop up the meat into small pieces and fry with oil. I asked for fried onions with mine, and it was standard (nothing special or different from what they served at Pat's). I felt like they may have given me less slices of cheese, but I didn't count it, so I can't be sure. It could also easily be that the chopped up pieces of meat from Pat's just melted and absorbed the cheese better than the long strips of meat from Geno's did. Overall, I think Pat's just packs a bit more flavor and a better texture. Neither side were particularly polite, although it was somewhat understandable given how long the lines were."
8018,9,2,1,8/5/2009,Geno's... Oh you mean the giant bug light and mess at 9th & Passayunk? ˜Skip it there are much better cheesesteaks in the city. ˜The locals don't go to Pat's or Geno's but if your going to go... I vote Pat's!
8019,9,3,1,8/4/2009,"More of a 2.5, but I rounded up. As I'm sitting here in PHL eating a philly cheesesteak ˜(shout-out to Jet Rock Bar & Grill in terminal D!) I can't say I'm deriving any less satisfaction from it than the one I had from Geno's. The cheesesteak at Geno's is by no means NASTY, but c'mon, this is supposed to be Philly's best? The rainbow colored neon signs that we saw 5 blocks away showed promise (Pat's, you've gotta work on the decor, your place looks downright morbid compared to Geno's fluorescent faux-Vegas lights and like a flying insect I was inexplicably drawn to it) but the sandwich left something to be desired. Everything was just so.. average. Probably a little bit on the bland side, even. I don't know, I think I'd rather have a cheesesteak from Charley's at the mall. p.s. Mean workers :( and shady-lookin' neighborhood."
8020,9,2,1,8/2/2009,"I went to Geno's when I was on vacation in Philly for 2 nights on July 22 and the 23rd of this year, their fries suck and we're some of the worst I've ever had but the cheesesteak was good but I've had much better cheesesteaks elsewhere, the workers we're nicer here than at Pat's. I know a lot of people get offended by the ""This is America, Speak English"" sign that's there but it has nothing to do racism, it's just you live in the United States, that's the main language we speak here and it annoys me too when people immigrate to the U.S. but make no attempt to learn our language, it will only help you a lot if you learn english, if you want to speak your native language, that's your choice but english is the main language in the U.S., just my 2 cents. But this place is a tourist trap and I won't be back."
8021,9,3,1,7/31/2009,ordered provolone with because at pats i had the whizz so i wanted to compare......there might be backlash but with the provolone i feel like i have had just as good of steaks in california at johns philly grille or even phillys best..... id probably give it 2.5 and round up for the experience.
8022,9,2,1,7/31/2009,"This is the best in Philadelphia? Well, it's the best if you compare it to Pat's, because the provolone actually tastes like cheese and the meat tastes like it came from a mammal. Otherwise it blows. ˜What's with the local tradition of squishy, tasteless rolls, bland overcooked peppers, and canned mushrooms? ˜Yack!"
8023,9,2,1,7/31/2009,Better roll than Pat's but that is where it ends. You'll find better steaks elsewhere but if you've never been to Philadelphia before you have to try a steak at Geno's then at Pat's to compare for yourself. The fries with whiz at Geno's are pretty decent.
8024,9,3,1,7/30/2009,"One Liner: Yummy! This is one of those places that you must try it once....and exactly once if possible. Food: (scale of 0-4) 2 Geno's cheese steak is so famous that you just have to try it at least once. Like other cheese steak lovers, I visited the mecca of cheese steaks. Before I went, I completed my training on ""how to order a cheese steak"". I was all ready to go ""Whiz wit!"", which for those cheese steak virgins means ""cheese steak with cheese whiz and onion"". By the time I walked up to the window, I decided to test the cheese steak nazi by ordering in a non-compliant way. I was surprised that I didn't get yelled at. It may have something to do with me being the only person on the line. I did get rudely sent to the next window for my root beer though. As soon as I got the cheese steak, I opened it up and munched it down in 5 minutes. It was a good sandwich. I must say that it was better than any cheese I have ever had in the mall. However, it wasn't mind blowing by any stretch. I probably wouldn't take the time to visit again unless I happen to walk by the store. The cost was $30 in taxi fare to get there, $30 in taxi fare to get back to where I was and 10 bucks for the food. Extras: (Scale of 0-1) ˜0.5 Service 0.1: The service was fine. (unlike the legendary rumor of the extra impatient and rude services) Decor 0.1: Who cares Speed 0.2: Fast (probably why it didn't taste as legendary as I expected) Dessert 0.1: The drinks.......ok it was just birch beer Prices 0.1: The prices were decent. ˜ My score for this experience is 2.6 stars. After all, it's Geno's, just by being there, serving me food, it deserves a round up to 3 stars. However, as I mentioned, I wouldn't go again unless I'm walking right by the store. Once is enough:)"
8025,9,1,1,7/28/2009,"Chances are 90% of the people who genuinely enjoy this place are tourists. I've been here several times. The first time was nothing special, the second the meat was dry, so was the third, and the fourth the lady at the window had an attitude when I told her they gave me the wrong kind of cheese. Tourists, if you're looking for a GOOD Philly cheesesteak, I advise you to go elsewhere. You'll be $8 short and very disappointed."
8026,9,1,1,7/28/2009,"are you serious!? this is the famous cheesesteak house people are talking about? unless you like dry roastbeef substitute for steak and cardboard bread by all means this the spot then. ˜Ontop of that, it was way too pricey for its size and definately its quality. ˜Only cool thing about this place is that it's 24/7. ˜Whoever wrote a good review on this must've just came from the bar hella drunk cuz everything good when you're drunk. ˜ Oh word on the street is that whoever opened up geno's started out in ""Chicago"" making ""philly"" cheesesteaks."
8027,9,3,1,7/24/2009,"The infamous cheesesteak goto place that my friends talk about and even the food network. Our first trip to Philly and like every tourist we had to stop by here and Pat's. We each bought the cheesesteak with provolone and onions. The line was not bad at all. But for $8, it wasn't that exciting. Like other reviewers, I agree the sandwiches were bland. I was expecting lots of flavor and juices bursting in my mouth, but all I had was somewhat juicy meat that needed to be washed down with soda. But we did agree that is place was better than Pat's. Definitely a place to visit for first timers. I wish they had more patio tables though. Parking wasn't bad either."
8028,9,1,1,7/22/2009,"If you're looking for a McDonald's equivalent of a cheesesteak, this is the place to go. The best part of the cheesesteak is the bread and ketchup. I went here a few weeks back with my friend and his family. His baby niece said it best, ""Bread, pwweeeaaase."" The steak itself is homogeneous, it tastes like a greasy sponge. I really couldn't taste the ""meat"" or the ""cheese"" or anything else for that matter. If you want to go to a touristy place and pay a hefty buck for something television programs advertise as famous, come here. The steak isn't worth it though (they are open 24h, so that is a plus not worthy of a star though.) You may also be insulted by their refusal to serve you if you don't speak English."
8029,9,2,1,7/20/2009,"Greasy but ok. ˜Went there on a business trip because of all the speak english hype at the time. ˜It's located in what I consider a sketchy part of town, but probably ok in south Philly standards."
8030,9,2,1,7/13/2009,"I don't think i'll eat a philly cheese steak ever again. It does NOT look or taste appetizing, and my stomach definitely did not agree with it. =T It's not good for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late night, or desserts!!!"
8031,9,2,1,7/12/2009,"Went to Geno's well just because you have to.. you see it all the time. ˜I was told by a friend who lives in Philly to skip it.. but of course, you can't. ˜Waiting in line for about 25mins. ˜Ordered Steak, Wit, Provolone. ˜ Meh. ˜That is all. P.S. - It says CAUTION HOT SAUCE.. caution.. this is hot sauce. ˜I have had hot stuff in my life, and this was hot. ˜My eyes were watering, my mouth was drooling, no nose was runny. ˜But god I loved every second of it."
8032,9,2,1,7/10/2009,HOT sauce?!? ˜My a$$ is still burning and I have been banned from the Sheraton - maid required a hazmat suit to clean the bathroom. ˜Thanks Geno's.
8033,9,2,1,7/8/2009,"Hummmm what can I say about my 1st experience about the Infamous Geno's & Pat's (unfortunately you can't speak about one without speaking about the other [it not my fault yall set up that way] so please note that my comments will be the exact same on Pat's yelp page) Well my wife and arrive in Philly about 11ish and this was our first stop.....1st time in Philly why not stop at the Infamous ""Tourist Trap - Pat & Geno's (I'm starting to think they should squash the rivalry and just combine the two...it's not like they both are any better then the other).....Ok I'm getting ahead of myself. So we find parking (and yes we had to search near and far to park) after finding a parking spot over and around the Mulberry bush we then walked several blocks till we found ourselves in the crossfire of the two PAT'S & GENO'S..... My wife and I came up with a game -plan she would get a Cheese Steaks from Pat's and I would get one from Geno's and we would see who's the best. After standing in line for about 20 min a piece we met back up in the middle of the street (because I overheard some folks saying that the two places do not allow each others food and products over in their respective areas) A bunch a nonsense if you ask me...... So in the middle of the street on top of a mail box we have the two Cheese Steaks sitting there side by side....I take half of the Geno's and my wife takes half of Pat's so we bite into each half expecting and thinking that we are about to taste heaven itself...........WOMP WOMP WOMP!!!!!!!!!!!!! A total disappointment..... In my mind I was thinking...""if this is the best that Philly has to offer then Philly may want to rethink what food they want to add there name too."" Pat's & Geno's both: - Had VERY bland Cheese Steaks (hardly NO flavor to either one) - Not enough Steak - Very rude (as if I the customer owe them something in addition to my 8 dollars) I have never met a group of individuals that have a well-known establishment treat and look at there customers as if they are mad that we choose to stop here. Bottom line....coming to Pat & Geno's was worth the trip here ONLY to say that I have been there but the food is not worth bragging about or even coming back too if I am in desperate need or craving for a true Philly Cheese Steak. Too conclude or trip in Philly 8 hours later....I called a buddy of mine who is a Native Philly Residents and he informed me about a spot in North Philly called ""Paganos"".....we stop here on our way leaving Philly and if you want to know the rest about this GOD SENT PLACE....then you have to read about its page. yelp.com/biz/paganos-ste?"
8034,9,3,1,7/5/2009,"I was told by many people from Philly to skip the Geno's/Pat's tourist trap but I couldn't help myself. ˜The cab ride wasn't far and I have seen the plae on the travel channel so many times it had to be a stop on the list. ˜ The line is long but moves pretty quickly. I don't think the service was great...they only half listened to what I said. It looked clean, and the food was good. ˜ The bread was fresh, the steak was quality and what doesn't taste good doused in cheese? ˜ I ultimately decided on Geno's as opposed to Pats ˜because I wanted chunks of steak- not just shaved steak."
8035,9,5,1,7/4/2009,"Geno's wins in the Pat's vs. Geno's War. We tried both, Pat's first. Then on to Geno's and Geno's clearly wins. First off, they're nicer to you when ordering, and they wrap their sandwich up, which is handy if you're ordering it to go, and also nice so grease doesn't drip down the side and ruin your clothes (see my Pat's review-ahem). Secondly, the sandwich is just better. The bread is softer and there's not as much of it. Pat's is really doughy, and I came for steak, not bread! I ordered Wiz, without. The steak was great, the Wiz mixed perfectly in, and the whole thing was piping hot (my sandwich at Pat's was lukewarm). My husband ordered the exact sandwich at both places to be ""scientific"", and I tried both his way, and Geno's still wins (I ordered provolone at Pat's). I hate cheese wiz, but decided to try it as that's what's famous on a cheesesteak, and I have to say ""I get it!"". There is something about that combination that's just tasty. Worth the trip to Philly just for a taste of Geno's. Loved it!"
8036,9,2,1,7/1/2009,"Someone wrote ""sucks less than Pat's"". ˜That sums it up really well. Consider this item, it is at least ONE HUNDRED TIMES CLEANER than Pat's."
8037,9,2,1,6/26/2009,"When people ask me which is better, Geno's or Pat's. I tell them Geno's, because it sucks less that Pats. ˜In my opinion both of these places are tourist traps and neither have a really good cheesesteak, like the ones when I was growing up in Philly. ˜Actually it is getting hard to find a good cheesesteak anymore."
8038,9,5,1,6/24/2009,"I've had Pat's and Tony Lukes. It does beat Pat's, but not by much. The only difference I find is that Pat's breaks up their meat and Geno's doesn't. I'm not going to get into free speech or the racism bits that much because you can say what you want as long as you don't treat your customers like a racist then I don't care. What can you really say about this place. The cheese steaks are the best. Just remember how to order: cheese first than with or without onions (ex. ""whiz with"" is cheese steak with cheeze wiz and fried onions). I wonder how you would order if you don't want cheese. The onions are perfectly cooked and so is the meat. The bread is awesome too, so combined makes a perfect sub, hero, hoagie, or whatever you want to call it (NJ and PA generally call it a sub)."
5492,9,1,1,6/17/2009,"If you can read, thank a teacher. ˜If you can read in English, thank a Marine. ""This is America... order in English!""

8039,9,5,1,6/16/2009,"Are you people effin CRAZY?!?!?!?!!?! This place is a 55/5 how can you give them anything lower than that? It's the best damn cheesesteak period. Yah, I noticed the signs outside the store and im sure the owner is a racist mofo but he knows how to make a mean steak. Im not there to chat and make small talk with the motherfucker, im there for some food. If you want the best steaks, goto this place... if you wanna chat about the socialist policies of France with the owner, go somewhere else."
8040,9,4,1,6/14/2009,"So over the course of the past few years I've heard tons of stories about Pat's and Geno's, and about their Cheesesteak wars. But because I live on the West Coast I was never able to really see what's all the fuss is about. After researching the place for quite some time I arrived in the early afternoon pretty hungry. The line wasn't too long of a wait which was surprising but I'm not complaining. First thing I did was try out my accent in attempting to order a Whiz Wit. For those who don't know what that is that is steak with cheese whiz and onions. I knew I was a rookie in doing this but the cashier let me slide as I got my cheesesteak and headed off to get a drink and cheese fries. Even though that I read that this place doesn't get the best reviews, I decided to come here with an open mind and not much of an expectation due to the fact that I didn't want to be let down like a lot of the previous reviewers. In my opinion it's actually quite ridiculous to have such high expectations for a place, and to rate a place horribly just because your experience is not what you expected. I do know for a fact that the service was very friendly and very efficient in what they do. Now enough blabbering and onto the food. Naturally I wanted to try Geno's first simply because I heard Pat's was the originator so I wanted to save that for last. The only problem I had with their food is that the cheese fries tasted a little soggy and bland and felt like it was premade and sat around for a little while. The steak itself was great, changing things up for a change using whole slices of beef rather than cutting it up along with the fact that the meat itself was nicely seasoned. The bread was nice and fresh and everything was wrapped in a tidy way to prevent a mess of all the juices to go around. Even though there are not many places to sit around my friend and I decided just to eat the food in the car and our journey was complete."
8041,9,5,1,6/10/2009,"First and only time I went to Philly, I went to Geno's and Pat's in the middle of the night with coworkers, but I don't remember Pat's too well. ˜Although, the cheesesteaks here are as good as it gets. ˜Don't remember ever having better cheesesteak elsewhere! ˜If you can't decide on which one to go to...just eat at both of them!"
8042,9,3,1,6/9/2009,"Pat's ˜vs. Geno's = Pat's FTW! I ordered my cheeesesteak with mushrooms and cheese whiz. The cheese whiz was ok, but definitnely not my favorite ~ the mushrooms are not even sauteed or cooked very well so I think that made my sandwich not as tasty as Pat's. And man were they RUDE ~ my friend sat down while we ordered with a Pat's soda cup in her hand and she got yelled at to move! The nerve! They should be use to people trying BOTH places sicne they are within 50 steps from each other. Will I come back? Only if Pat's is closed I guess... *shrugs or maybe not go at all!"
8043,9,1,1,6/8/2009,I came from Va with my family just to try those two famouse places n we r so disappointed because taste is really bad nothing special
8044,9,1,1,6/2/2009,"Horrible!!! All the hype for nothing....Just another tourist spot...not worth the trip. ˜The bread was hard, the meat dry and nasty.....Really not worth it at all. ˜There are better philly cheesesteaks closer to downtown philly. ˜Go there instead."
8045,9,2,1,5/31/2009,Joey Vento served me my steaks at 6 am. these were simply OVER RATED. cleaner than Pat's... however neither were delicious. i believe this to be a tourist trap..
8046,9,1,1,5/28/2009,"Totally overrated. Lamest cheesteak I ever had. My friend summed it up well when he said ""wow we just paid 7 bucks for a school lunch sandwich"". Then we noted that we think we may have actually had better 'cheesesteaks' for school lunch actually. -The bread was so so. Not toasted or soft or anything nice. -The meat was pretty bland, the worst thing is when you got it, it wasnt even hot or juicy or anything. In my mind i was expecting some hot juicy steak, what I got was what looked like some steakums slices that didnt have much flavor. -I opted for provolone cheese. The cheese when I got it wasnt very melty either, and there wasn't a lot of it. -The fried onions didnt seem fried really. Again not very tasty, they seemed like the got clear simply by being near something hot long enough rather than really being fried. and that was that.. you didnt get anything else on your sandwich. I mean perhaps thats how they do it in philly. I dont know, all I know is i got WAY better philly cheesesteaks at the korean deli across the street from my office in virginia than this place. And all the signs and stuff that are up are kinda obnoxious at this place. Geno despite being italian apparently hates immigrants.. But at least sarah palin apparently loved her cheesesteak here... Dont waste your time coming."
8047,9,2,1,5/28/2009,"Though I made it a point to walk more than ten blocks to this landmark, deep in the heart of the Italian quarter of the city, it certainly was not worth the walk, or the freezing cold. Geno's has been around for ten decades, and is a philadelphia tradition, and being the tourist I am I had to try the infamous Philly Cheesesteak. ˜ Well, this place is very cut and dry. ˜You have a choice of cheesesteak with cheese, or without, curly or no curly fries, and a soft drink. ˜The ribeye, in my humble opinion, was too greasy, tasted very bland (basically it tasted like the day old grease it was fried in - along with the greasy greasy onions) and I had to use the ketchup liberally to choke half of it down. well, i was very hungy, so perhaps that is why i was able to eat more than half. there is no seating inside, so advisably i would not go if it is very cold, or steaming hot outside. ˜The tables are covered with photographs of celebrities, famous personages that have been past and present patrons of Geno's. ˜Perhaps it's due to me being used to the southwestern style of ˜cooking, with a lot of flavor and spice, that I was not quite so taken, or perhaps everybody that lines up around the block to eat here is wrong, and I am the only one that has any tastebuds."
8048,9,1,1,5/26/2009,"Worst steak I've had in Philly. Cannot understand why anyone likes this place. The folks behind the counter are unfriendly at best and down right rude under normal conditions. Food-wise, the steak was very bland. No salt/pepper. Cheese was like plastic. Way over priced for soggy, bland food. A real let down. I took my wife here as she was new to Philly as a tourist treat and we were sorely disappointed. The best steak I've had thus far is the unknown joint up on Somerset and Broad, ""Broad Street Steaks"". So good you'll hurt yourself! Leave this guy and his rude ways and get a real steak some place else."
8049,9,3,1,5/24/2009,"So like most tourist, I couldn't help myself and had to do the Philly cheese steak challenge. I walked from Chinatown to Pat's and Geno's hungry with aching feet and got in not one, not two, but three lines (I'll explain). First off note that both locations take cash only, and that you probably will not be able to get a table. We got our Philly cheese steaks with onions and whiz, since I was under the impression that was what a true Philly cheese steak was. We decided on Pat's first due to the fact that the line appeared to be shorter and moving faster (haha shorter). It took about thirty minutes to get through the line, and we were ready having observed the sign that said to have our order and cash ready, so we step up to the first window and order our Pat's Philly and realize there is another separate line for ordering soda's and fries, which I promptly ran to while my boyfriend waited for the sandwich, two lines 30 minutes. We walked a crossed the street and ate our sandwich on the street like animals. My first thought upon eating the cheese steak was I've made a better one at home. The meat lacked any flavor and I felt there wasn't enough whiz (which is strange since whiz actually makes me very sick...taking it for the yelp team today though). So now, not hungry, and realizing we stopped making these at home because whiz makes me sick, we stumble a crossed the street to Geno's and for consistency's sake ordered the same sub after waiting another 20 minutes in line. Geno's cooking area is open to the public, as we waited we watched the workers make the subs in a surprisingly clean kitchen. They cranked them out. When ordering we did note the Geno's guy said thanks, and he seemed in a better mood. Geno's meat as most people noted is sliced, rather than shredded, which I did think made it taster. Though it was gawdy as all get out, Geno's in my opinion produced a better sub. The bread at both seemed the same, though my boyfriend thought Pat's bread was better less bready. I also felt Geno's was a better cheese to meat ratio, cheesier, and the meat tasted as if it was seasoned or just a better quality of meat. But having now completed the challenge, I wouldn't go back to either."
8050,9,2,1,5/22/2009,"[This review covers both Pat's and Geno's, so it's posted at both pages.] So for some reason, my crazy friend, Elliott, and his friend, Bill, decided to drive from Richmond, VA to my house (oh, probably about 5 hours) Saturday morning to go into Philadelphia for cheesesteaks. Why? To put the ages-old debate between Pat's King of Steaks and Geno's Steaks to rest once and for all... Not that the debate will ever really die... We ended up hitting Pat's first, then trekking all over the city, only to return to Geno's before heading home. ˜Gotta work off the calories, yanno! In the end we all came to pretty much the same conclusion. Overall Pat's really is the King of Steaks. Geno's decor was overwhelming and gaudy. We did not find the giant picture of a cheesesteak surrounded by flashing neon lights on the roof to be particularly endearing and certainly did not add to the flavor of the sandwiches. The bright neon orange slathered all over every possible paintable surface did not help, either. I greatly preferred and appreciated the understated and unassuming simplicity of the decor (or lack thereof) that we found at Pat's. They still had what looked like the original Pepsi sign with their name. We were also taunted by a 10 year old walking by with a Geno's cup while we were minding our own business, sitting on the curb eating our steaks. None of us appreciated the blatant politics of Geno's either. For those unaware of the controversy, a few years ago Geno's was sued for having a sign on their window that said ""This is America, Speak English when ordering!!""... While I acknowledge their right to have whatever signs broadcasting whatever politics to which they ascribe, I find the hypocrisy of their Italian heritage coupled with their obvious prejudices to be quite distasteful. On to the actual food. The rolls from both place were exactly the same. More bread than meat - first bite: all bread. The onions at Pat's were actually fried, with that caramelized color and flavor I like in my onions (when on a cheesesteak, that is). Geno's onions seemed to have been lightly fried, more from incidental contact. They were still so crunchy that they were almost fresh. Not that I mind fresh onions, but fried onions aren't supposed to have that fresh-onion zing. They're supposed to be fried. The cheese. I could barely taste the cheese at Geno's. I opted for provolone, while my companions opted for the orange cheese-snot product called Cheez-Whiz. Pat's was generous with their provolone and the steak was hot enough to actually melt it before I was able to sink my teeth into it. Initially my companions did complain about the Whiz oozing out of the sandwich and onto the paper, but after eating at Geno's they realized that having enough Whiz to *taste*, much less have ooze out of the sandwich was a blessing, not a curse. Finally, the steak. This is the one point that we did have to give to Geno's. Pat's steak was shredded, more or less, which is really the way every cheesesteak I've had is. I have no complaints at all about shredded steak, however Geno's steak was sliced, so it actually maintained the classic ""steak"" texture, more reminiscent of roast beef than typical cheesesteak. This is really more about the style of cheesesteak than the quality. Though Geno's sliced style was a bit tastier, it wasn't what I think of when I think of a true Philly Cheesesteak. All in all I prefer the cheesesteak experience I found at Pat's King of Steaks. The fries were delicious (though I didn't try the fries at Geno's, I suspect they're about the same), the line moved faster, the onions weren't overwhelming, but just added to the sandwich, the cheese was tastier and meltier, and the whole experienced oozed real, authentic Philadelphia culture. If you want a taste of what Philadelphia really is all about, I'd recommend Pat's King of Steaks."
8051,9,4,1,5/20/2009,Have done a taste test between this and pats twice. I would have to say that meat is by far more lean and the bread rocks over their direct competitors. Always a line though - for good reason of course.
8052,9,1,1,5/17/2009,"tourist spot. ˜do not go here. ˜if you're from philly and you're giving this place a good review, shame on you. aside from a racist a-hole owning this place, the food is sub-par. ˜you could have a better steak by buying some amoroso's and getting some frozen steak ems at the acme."
8053,9,5,1,5/14/2009,"Geno's has a different kind of philly cheesesteak. Their meat is sliced in a different way and includes more fat (you can see the marbles), therefore increasing taste. The idiot tourists/yuppies on here will tell you to go to Pat's, but you can find a ""Pat's cheese steak"" anywhere in the city, because everyone copied the way Pat's did it. If I wanted a normal, run-of-the-mill Philly cheesesteak, I don't think I need to bike to 9th & Passyunk and have to deal with the gross countertops and even more disgusting people who work at Pat's, plus it's cheaper. I can get a Pat's cheese steak by walking around the corner. But a Geno's cheese steak is a trip in and of itself. Plus, it's cleaner. Real Philly natives choose Geno's. Pat's is for tourists and yuppies."
8054,9,2,1,5/14/2009,"Don't do it! I'm warning you! Stay away from the bright light!! So many people go here like bugs attracted to a bug zapper, but they end up regretting it in the end. I lived in Philly for 6 years and tried all of the touristy places like Pats, Jims, and Tony Luke's, as well as many local places, and almost all of them are better than Geno's. ˜ It may be because they're right across the street from Pats, one of the best cheese-steak places ever, but these steaks are just sub-par to stay the least. The meat is flavorless and nothing to get excited about. Now go across the street to that old shack and get yourself a real cheese-steak. Stay away from Geno's! You've been warned."
8055,9,1,1,5/14/2009,"Pat's cheesesteaks are the best reason to leave Geno's line! Lol! Geno's line may be shorter, but theres a reason for that!! My bf and I tried Geno's first, (as we suspected Pat's would be better), and we were right!! Geno's steaks were dry, chewy and the bun was practically empty. There was no seasoning or flavor to the meat. Pat's cheesesteak was far superior. It has more meat, and seasonings on the meat and the whiz, well that just steals the deal. It was hot, fast, and the line flies. You have to hit Pat's and order a ""wit whiz"" and youll be very satisfied. I cant wait to get back there."
8056,9,2,1,5/14/2009,"This place creeped me out with all their hostile sinage, and then the food wasn't even that great. ˜If you're in the neighborhood just go across the street to Pat's."
8057,9,5,1,5/13/2009,"I just really like Geno's. I am not going to apologize. Maybe there are better cheesesteak places in Philly, but sometimes I cannot resist Geno's neon frenzy - it is a beacon in the night. I always order the Provolone Wit and I know what I am getting -- no surprises, no adventures, and I am fine with that. I have tasted a lot of cheesesteaks and Geno's provolone is not tasteless (ahem, Rick's steaks) or TOO sharp for me (Tony Luke's) and the onions are perfection. For me, the onions make or break the sandwich. Also the bread-- not too soft, not too crunchy. I don't have much to say about the meat -- I've never had reason to complain about it. Call the place xenophobic if you want to, but I think their unabashed, take-no-prisoners patriotism is refreshing! And I think they see the humor in it ... at least I hope they do."
8058,9,3,1,5/11/2009,"My first cheesesteaks were at Geno's after a Sixers game. I had a ""provolone wit"" and thought it was good. It was greasy but dangit, it was a real cheesesteak. The steak was cooked well and the roll was very soft. Too bad they don't do next day delivery! Hopefully I'll be back ˜when I catch an Eagles game."
8059,9,2,1,5/8/2009,"Ok, I just have to be honest with myself. Despite all the hype, the food is sub par. The steak had an aftertaste and I suppose that's the taste of uncooked meat, and how can you argue because the line is atrociously long and the Geno's people are trying to speed everything along. Now about the bread...it's stale. It's not just a tad or a bit stale...it's stale. The only thing that really made up for it was the generous coating of cheez whiz. Asides for the fun and attractive lights out in front, the food is not worth waiting in line for again. oh yeah....and *BEWARE* *BEWARE* for the HOTSAUCE!!! IT'S HELL RAISING!!!"
8060,9,4,1,5/5/2009,"Final Decision: The best Phillycheesesteak in town.... I came through here on my road trip back to Cali, and had to try both Pat's and Geno's. ˜I was not disappointed with either. ˜I had the Wit Whiz over at Pat's and enjoyed it, but here we had the Wit Provolone. ˜I really liked the flavor of the steak and how tender it came out in the sandwich. ˜However, if I had to do it over again, I would have gotten Wit Whiz and my experience would have been complete. In comparison, it seems as if the sandwich that I got from Geno's seems to have had a little bit more marbling, which contributed to the tenderness of the steak in the sandwich. ˜The provolone added additional smokiness, but I preferred the tangy, savory flavor of cheez whiz in my sandwiches. ˜Next I know, and knowing is half the battle...GI JOE..."
8061,9,5,1,5/4/2009,"Maybe it's because I'm from California, and have always had crappy cheesesteaks...but Geno's cheeseteak with Provolone was the best darn sandwich I've ever had. ˜Being back home makes me sad, because I wish I could get a cheesesteak from Geno's. ˜Someone please tell me where I can find a comparable cheesesteak in Southern California and I will love you forever. ˜ By the way, the Hot Sauce is really really hot...be careful. ˜All in all, I enjoyed it a lot and wish I had gotten one to go while I was there. ˜Unfortunately I was only there for one day."
8062,9,1,1,4/22/2009,"2 / 11 of my cheesesteak pilgrimage (see my list!) Both my best friend and sister said they preferred this place to Pat's. ˜I couldn't understand why. ˜Food non-withstanding, I barely understand why this is a famous attraction. ˜Other than the pretty lights, Geno's really has no claim to any cheesesteak fame. ˜I'm all for patriotism, but ""freedom fries"" and asking customers to speak English is ludicrous to me. The bread and cheese were ok, but the meat had an awful, almost styrofoam texture and it was incredibly greasy. ˜If you must come to this infamous intersection, stick with the original across the street, then hit up some local's/Yelper's favorites."
8063,9,2,1,4/13/2009,"Geno's or Pat's? ˜Pat's or Geno's? ˜I guess that is the question. ˜Well, I'm just visiting from Los Angeles, so I tried both back-to-back within 5 minutes of each other (they are located across the street from each other). I ordered a ""Wiz wit"" from each one (what's with the stupid ordering system?) and I thought Pat's was the winner. ˜Geno's wasn't bad, but I liked the steak better at Pat's. BTW, I've had better cheesesteak sandwiches in California. ˜I think these places are more for the experience, rather than the actual cheesesteak...similar to Pink's in LA."
8064,9,1,1,4/13/2009,"One star is one too many. This place came highly recommended by two friends of mine from NYC. I was excited to give it a try, however, when I approached, I was repelled by a sign reading: ""We honor his memory. Officer Daniel Faulkner - Murdered by Mumia Abu-Jamal - December 9, 1981"" I am sure that anyone who is familiar with the subject would be equally disgusted. To the owners of Geno's: I hope your establishment burns to the ground for your continued support of the incarceration of an innocent man. If you truly cared about the late Mr. Faulkner, you would lend this same level of support to a full inquiry into the actual circumstances surrounding his death, as opposed to blindly endorsing the findings of what are widely regarded as the most corrupt police force and district attorney's office in the United States. Go stick one of your famous cheesesteaks up your old-school, northeast white-flight style, racist asses. To the patrons of Geno's: If you have a conscience, you should educate yourself as to the circumstances surrounding the incarceration of former Black Panther leader Mumia Abu-Jamal and join me in a boycott of this total shit hole, until such time as this ignorant piece of signage is removed. ˜ Free Mumia! Fuck Geno's! Eat at Pat's!"
8065,9,1,1,4/11/2009,"This may be heresy, but for a guy who's lived in many places before moving to Phildelphia, I still have no idea what the fuss about Geno's is all about. ˜I suppose that enough folks must like their cheesesteaks cold and dry. ˜However, I tend to like warm and moist beef with real cheese, not the kinda artificial stuff that comes out of a can. ˜My advice - visit Great Steak and Potato at any suburban mall and save yourself a disappointing experience."
8066,9,3,1,4/11/2009,"Like a moth to a flame, the bf and I were attracted to the bright lights of Geno's. This time we ordered a cheese steak whiz with onions ($7.50) and I don't know if it's the whiz that's talking, but I found it better than Pat's. Even the onions I found to be tastier and although this sandwich was wet (leaking out beef, onion and whiz juice), I preferred that over the grease that leaked out and soon congealed from Pat's sandwiches. The bread at both establishments were the same and the decor was pretty similar with old pictures posted EVERYWHERE."
8067,9,4,1,4/10/2009,"I went here a couple of months ago. This was the first time I had a Philly cheese steak in Philly! ˜When I went, it was like 20 degrees (FREEZING). I approached the window and starred at the menu (the only variety was cheese). The guy who was taking my order knew I was obviously out of town because I was freezing my butt off; he asked me where I was from and I responded the OC. He's like whoa and just gave me a bunch of stickers and pens. COOL! So then I ordered a Philly whiz cheese steak. Boy do they make it fast! You have to eat it right away or it gets cold fast and won't taste as good. I had a good experience here. Oh yeah, Geno's all decked out in Patriotism, I had a good laugh reading some of the signs."
8068,9,2,1,4/2/2009,I think my hunger was the only reason why I found the cheesesteak so delicious. ˜All the locals told me to try Jim's but unfortunately it was already closed and I was only visiting for the day. The service was extremely fast but there was nothing spectacular about this cheesesteak at all. ˜The bun was soggy and all I could really taste was cheese whiz so that's probably why my mind thought it was good. ˜I've eaten frozen cheesesteaks that taste better plus when I make them I don't have to worry about rude service. I wish I would have went to Pat's across the street.
8069,9,2,1,3/30/2009,"Sticker in the window - ""If you can read, thank a teacher. ˜If you can read in English, thank a US Marine""...wait...what? Everyone recommended going down to South Philly for Pat's and Geno's for the ultimate tourist experience, so my friend who lives there now and I went and had Pat's, and then crossed the road to Geno's right after. ˜Geno's put the Cheez Whiz on the bun, then the steak and then the onions. ˜The bread was less soggy than Pat's, but the onions absolutely sucked. Everything is bright orange, there is the ""This is 'Merica, Speak English"" sign, the fries are called ""Freedom Fries"", and the cheesesteak was not worth $7.50, in fact it was actually kind of bland."
8070,9,4,1,3/28/2009,"Anyone who says that Pat's is better is WRONG! Geno's is where it's at! the bun was fresh and the meat was tasty. The cheese was juicy and the onions were perfectly done. Be warned: the hot sauce is HOT. I mean.... I love spicy food... I can take the hottest thai, indian, whatever you can throw at me... but Geno's hot sauce is a force to be reckoned with! the first time you have one make sure you have it WITHOUT the hot sauce or it will totally overpower it. I made the mistake of thinking I was badass and putting two pumps of the stuff on my second one and god damn was I sorry. Just say no. ...dont get me wrong.. the sauce tastes delicious but.. it obscures the simple delight that is a Geno's steak. I think the whole... 'order in english' thing is really stupid and makes them look ignorant but that is not why I was there.. I was there for the 'with onions and wiz'"
8071,9,3,1,3/26/2009,It's hard to remember exactly what the steak itself tasted like because I was fool enough to add far too much hot sauce to mine - even though the sauce cart has a warning sign. I wished I could have eaten it untainted but I liked what I could eat. The bread was especially tasty and the beef didn't seem too greasy. I can't comment too much on the overall taste though since it suffered the most from my overzealous condimentitis.
8072,9,3,1,3/25/2009,"Geno's is one of those places you need to get to if you are into famous food places. The cheesesteaks are good if you like cheeseteaks. Not worth $7.50, but they are decent. I have been to the big tourist 3 of Philly cheesteak places which seems to be Geno's, Pat's and Tony Luke's. They are all good. I'd probably give the edge to Pat's."
8073,9,1,1,3/16/2009,"I make better vegetarian cheese steaks than Geno's makes with meat. ˜Although my claim is not unique to Geno's because I find that most cheese steak places make a pretty bland product. ˜It is like they never heard of seasonings. ˜But I would never go to Geno's again simply because Joey Vento is such a bigot. ˜What a hypocrite. ˜The son of immigrants who is now against immigrants. ˜The influx of Mexicans, though, means there are a lot more choices for where to eat in the 9th Street vicinity anyway, and the Mexicans season their food so it tastes good."
8074,9,3,1,3/14/2009,"When in South Philadelphia you must go for a cheese steak at Gino's, with onions and Whiz. Line was about 100 people deep and we waited for about 40 min. while looking at the hundreds of photos that tile the facade. Cheese steak was good, not great, fresh bread, decent cuts of beef, the Cheese Whiz sealed the deal. And, for the record, I shot some b-ball outside of Gino's. Cross this off the list."

8076,9,3,1,3/13/2009,"Bring your passport, and definitely not your resident alien card...no, no, I kid, its not that bad. ˜I mean, who knows, I was with a tall Irish guy, so and this girl I went to school with once came by my fraternity house looking for, ""the tanned guy,"" so maybe my experience was a little different. Seriously though, the steaks at Pat's are better and while the staff across the street might be just as surly, they're not just dicks for the sake of being dicks. ˜ By the way, if you're feeling especially gluttonous, I suggest going to Geno's, waiting on line, getting your sandwich and eating it while you walk over to Pat's to do the same. ˜A buddy of mine and I did that once...no ill effects either."
8077,9,3,1,3/9/2009,Pat's was better
8078,9,1,1,3/9/2009,"i remembered seeing this place on the travel channel once so i decided to dropped by to eat ˜at this place during my 2 weeks trip along the east coast last year and i must say they make one of the worst steak sandwich i have ever consumed in my life. ˜i would rather go to subway or quiznos to get my sandwich fix than to ever go back to geno's. i dont know about the other place across the street tho, i think its called ""pat's"" , ˜but i bet its equally bad judging that both places are packed with steak sandwich fans in which till this day i have yet come to understand. maybe its just me but i dont think i will ever understand the hype for these two philly cheese steak joints."
8079,9,3,1,3/6/2009,"Typically, I'd write a long review detailing every incident, but there has been over 200 reviews and I honestly doubt anyone will really read this. Geno's is decent. When you're drunk at half-past 2:00am and get the drunchies from drinking all night, Geno's is alright. When you live like 4 blocks from it and you're really drunk, Geno's is damn good. When you're sober, and realize that some of the lunch trucks make better cheesesteak's than Geno's, you realize that it's not as amazing as it was the previous night. It does the job, it cures the salt/grease/cheese fix in one go, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there. Also, to all you tourists: Yeah, it's KIND OF a landmark, but do you really want to go back to your home town saying that the ""best"" cheeseteaks in Philly suck? I thought not. Check out Jim's on South if you still feel like being a tourist, otherwise go to Tony Luke's. You'll thank me later."
8080,9,4,1,3/4/2009,"When deciding which of these powerhouses they prefer, I think it makes sense that people tend to favor the one they tried first. ˜Unless you alternate bites from one and then the other in order to get as unbiased an opinion as possible, you're probably going to eat an entire hoagie first and then try the other one. ˜And in that case, you would favor the first hoagie since that's the one you ate when you were really hungry. Well, through no fault of Geno's (except maybe for providing too clean and bright an atmosphere), I tried Pat's first and then walked over to Geno's. ˜ It's been years since I was there, but I do remember favoring the meat at Geno's just slightly more than the meat at Pat's. ˜Other than that though, I thought the bread and cheese were better at Pat's. ˜I know it's strange (and perhaps just wrong) to judge a cheese steak by something other than the actual steak, but hey, like I said, Pat's was first and so it shall hold the edge in my heart. But if I'm ever in Philadelphia again, I'll try Geno's first to even the playing field and we'll see what happens. ˜Either way, they both blow any other cheese steaks here out of the water. ˜Next time I'll have to try Jim's as well.

8086,9,2,1,2/17/2009,"Meh. I've experienced better. Better is Pat's Steaks right across the street. 20 footsteps away, sir. Geno's uses hard, old bread, watery, nasty Cheese Whiz replica, and seemingly soy blend steak 'slices' that remind me of a variation of White Castle patties. I am an out of towner, from Detroit, and went to South Philly while visiting the City of Brotherly Love and must say that after trying both sandwiches at once - the quality and taste was by far superior with Pat's. Pat's uses better steak (chopped the way it should be) real cheesesteak sliced and grilled nicely with a more satisfying grilled texture, warmer softer bread, and REAL cheese whiz. Save yourself a couple bucks and get Pat's. Thank you."
8087,9,2,1,2/9/2009,"Whew, what a line. Stopped by here to try out a Pat's and a Geno's in order to figure out which one I liked better. Turns out, I liked Pat's better. The bread here is the same as at Pat's, and the meat quantity is about the same. They gave me around the same amount of mushrooms and onions, too. They cut the bread all the way through when splitting the sandwich, so it was leaking by the time I opened up the foil and paper, and I tried this after I had the Pat's.... but still finished with more than enough room to have some Freedom Fries (cute idea, badgering the French, I guess). Tables actually seemed cleaner than across the street. Service was swift, blunt, and more or less what I expected out of somewhere so busy. Seating is again outdoors under an overhang. Overall, an okay cheesesteak that is greasy and filling but not really packed with ingredients. Satisfies but doesn't fill me."

8090,9,4,1,2/6/2009,"I like Geno's a lot, and I think it's a lot better than Pat's. ˜The meat is more tender and tastes better, hands down. ˜I say go for whiz - it's hot, melty, cheesy (I'm starting to sound like Taco Bell commercial) - the provolone doesn't melt because they make the sandwiches so fast the cheese goes straight on the bun and not on the grill. ˜That's a little disappointing, but it is what it is. ˜I dare you to ask them to melt it next time. ˜You'll be buried and they'll have a plaque for you on the ground next to the one for all the cops killed in the line of duty. ˜ Seriously though the people are actually nice and they think it's funny that people are afraid of them. ˜That's the shtick though. ˜If you want a classic philly with the more tasty, more tender meat, come to Geno's over Pat's. ˜They're both classics and you gotta go to both if you're here, but my winner is Geno's in the cross-street rivalry."
8091,9,2,1,2/6/2009,"I hate giving a place like this low stars because I'm right there with them on politics and they gave me a bumper sticker and pen. The service was friendly but people go out to eat for good food first and foremost. I felt this sandwhich that I got was BLAND to the max. Oh lordy, it was too bland. Being from Texas when they said ""steak"" I thought it would taste like steak. Yes, I knew that it doesn't look like a hunk o'steak, that it's shaved like meat but it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. ˜I really wanted to like them, I really did."
8092,9,2,1,2/5/2009,"Foodwise, this is a solid 3 stars, but the sheer malevolence of the place is so off-putting that I'll never be back. Much tenderer meat than Pat's, with toastier bread, but alas, the same lackluster chopped onions. Even if you're pretty right-wing in your politics, the people at both Pat's and Geno's have attitudes that made 4 hardened Bostonians take note. When you hire more xenophobic dicks than townie spots in Southie, you are a Jedi Master of racist asshattery."
8093,9,2,1,1/30/2009,"My BF and I had a layover in Philly 1/21/2009, so instead of sitting in the airport for 8 hours we decided to take a mini tour of the city. ˜ We wanted an ""authentic"" Philly Cheese Steak and we were told by the people we talked to that Geno's was the place we need to go. ˜We went to Geno's where we got the sandwiches with whiz, onions and mushrooms. ˜They were ok, but not the best we've ever had. ˜The pictures of celebrities covering the walls was cool, but there is no where to sit, so be prepared to get them to go or eat outside."
8094,9,4,1,1/27/2009,"I was in PA for sometime actually in a small city near Harrisburg. I figured why not, let's go to the big city of Philly! Nice place, enjoyed it for the day and just you took a look around the downtown and surrounding areas. This basically epitomized the trip, I was walking toward Geno's for a Philly, never really enjoyed them in Chicago there isn't any I could think of as good, anyways, as I was walking one of those tourist horse buggies was passing thru, with the guide dressed up in that old revolutionary get up. Suddenly this bread truck cuts of the buggy and almost hits the poor horse! The guide was in the middle of a sentence speaking to the tourist on board ""on your right you'll see the liberty bell blah blah"" and notices what happens and then he lets of a horrid slew of insults worthy of any New Yorker or Chicagoan, and then as if nothing happened, continues on with his tour guide of historic downtown Philly! Classic. Anyways we made it to Geno's and lo and behold Pat's was right across the street! But the line was bigger at Geno's so we went there first. Best Philly I ever had. Geno's was bangin! I'm sure the locals know what the best really is, but you can't deny that Geno's is nationally recognized. One wiz wit it! All those Hollywood stars can't be wrong! Can they?"
8095,9,3,1,1/23/2009,"We stopped here first. ˜It was kinda hard to miss. ˜The sandwich with whiz and onions was good. ˜The roommate said I had to put ketchup on it, which was nice. ˜I couldn't really enjoy the sandwich because of all the nasty politics that were served alongside. ˜I don't even like it when Bay Area places serve the politics I like with my meal - I certainly don't like the crap Geno shares."
8096,9,5,1,1/23/2009,Mmmm. They do not hide behind flashy lights...GENO'S wins in my book.
8097,9,3,1,1/22/2009,"After landing at PHL but before trekking south on I-95 to Washington, DC we decided to be total tourists and go sample the local cuisine. ˜So a trip to Geno and Pat's it shall be. Driving down Passyunk Avenue, Geno's caught our eye from many blocks away. ˜It was like a slice of Vegas plopped into Philadelphia. ˜So here is part one of two our Geno and Pat's experiment: Control: One cheesesteak, with onions and cheese whiz. Bread: ˜It sucks; it was cold and stale. ˜I didn't know how spoiled I was in California when it comes to bread. Meat: Cooked well done and was quite consistent. Cheese: Dude, it's cheese whiz. Miscellaneous: I think I lost liberal points by patronizing this business. ˜I think this is the first time I've seen anti-Mumia stuff (but then I do live a stone's throw away from Berkeley) and I kindly greeted with a bumper sticker to tell me learn English because I'm in America. I wonder if the original Geno's parents spoke good English."
8098,9,5,1,1/22/2009,Geno's is an institution in Philadelphia. I love a place that has direct competition across the street(Pat's) but still remains and considers cheese whiz a food group. The cheese steaks are tasty. If you are ever in Philly try Geno's
8099,9,1,1,1/13/2009,"Throw your arms in the air and scream for south Philly's finest community certified vomit-hole. Hello Slobs, .... Oh, the trough? This way please.... ... Traffic? Disregard it, don't worry, they understand you need what your after, they'll wait. ... Hold on, your too drunk to order? It's okay, no worries, just scream. Screaming will give you attention and eventually steak. ... Wait a minute, steak makes you vomit? No sweat! That's why your here in the first place. Vomit away. Vomit away."
8100,9,4,1,1/12/2009,"located right across the street from Pat's. I can see the competition between these two shacks is fierce. I went to the area twice during my trip to Philly, and both times the line and Geno's is longer. It has only one item on the menu but that one item is worth my visit. The steaks are sliced very thin and it's very tender, the onion is well cooked, and when I asked ""with onion"", the guy actually took it in. Because the onion really made the cheesesteak that much more flavorful. Their fries are not as good but I would prefer Geno's at anytime."
8101,9,3,1,1/12/2009,"If this is the best cheesesteaks that the US can offer, I don't think I'm a die-hard cheesesteak fan, but this joint definitely has character and isn't too bad tasting. ˜The bun seemed a tad pedestrian to me, but it was really soft and toasted perfectly. ˜I ordered Whiz With, and the cheese whiz kind of ruined the meat for me as it seeped through to the supposedly amazing beef. ˜Overall, the sandwich as a whole was acceptable, but I'd prefer something with a bit more unique taste or ingredients. ˜I'm not too much of a purist of Philly steaks I guess. ˜Sorry."
8102,9,4,1,1/8/2009,"I visited Geno's over the New Year holiday with my boyfriend. ˜We ventured forth to do the great taste test of Pat's vs. Geno's. ˜We both agree that Geno's will be the place receiving any future endeavors of ours. ˜In fact, we were sad to leave Philly and have been craving another Geno's since. I ordered a ""Wit Whiz"" and was definitely impressed with the meat and the bun. ˜I thought they were both excellent. ˜My only complaint is that I wish they would use a bit more ""Whiz"" and $7.50 for a sandwich still boggles my small-town mind. ˜The staff was friendly and the food was served fast and hot. ˜Don't be put off by the ""right wing"" paraphernalia and signs. Even though it was a bit pricey in my opinion, I still prefer Geno's over Pat's when it comes to taste. ˜I'll definitely go back."
8103,9,3,1,1/6/2009,"Considering that this was the first time I have every had an authentic cheesesteak, I insisted that some of my classmates from FT. Indiantown Gap take me to Philadelphia and try one. I was also surprised to find out that they used Cheese Whiz instead of Provolone, Cheddar, etc., like I've been used too. I did hear all about the battle with Pat's and I was shocked that they were pretty much right next to each other. Anyways, my roommate was a Geno's fan. So I took my business there. It wasn't too bad. The Cheese Whiz got all over the place, but tasted ok. I wasn't impressed though. I just wish that I would've walked across the street and tried Pat's so that I can make a decision as to which one I thought was better."
8104,9,1,1,1/5/2009,The worst cheesesteaks in Philly. ˜I think they got caught up in the race to make faster sammies then Pat's and forget to put in the meat. ˜Way too much bread in every bite. ˜Top it off with rude service and overpriced sandwiches. ˜Walk across the street to Pat's unless you just want some cheese fries from some rude guy.
8105,9,4,1,1/4/2009,"And part two of my internal ""Pat's vs Geno's Cheesesteak Battle"" was at Geno's Steaks. ˜I must say that I did not notice any signs telling me how to order a steak. The guy behind the window was very friendly and was making conversation with me. Granted, there was no one else on line so he had time to talk, which I'm assuming is rare for him (And maybe because I spoke English he liked me but that's a whole other bag). I ordered six more steak sandwiches wit' melted Cheez Whiz and onions. Yes, I said six more - come on, I'm not going down to south Philly just to get one sandwich, please! ˜Ahhh, now this was more like it. While Pat's cheesesteak was tasty but a little hard to chew, Geno's was right on the money. Not hard to chew at all, and the hot onions and melted cheese, again, was right on the money. Eating it at my car, while looking at the South Philly Musicians Mural with Fabian, Frankie Avalon and Chubby Checker just made me feel as if I was a genuine Philly resident. All I needed to do was yell out, ""yo Adrian!"""
8106,9,1,1,1/4/2009,"I'm going to preface this review by saying the sandwich isn't totally sh!t, it is tasty. I have eaten them. I live around the block, and that is why the rest of the review deserves a 0. No.1 - We all at this point know that Joey Vento is ashamed of his immigrant history and hates other immigrants, but here is the question I want SOMEONE to answer.... How exactly do you order a cheesesteak in Spanish or any other language?? quesocarne wit? I don't even think anyone did order in another language, cheesesteak just seems untranslatable to me. No.2 - and this is the REAL reason no one should get food here... it is priced for tourists not locals... I mean 7 dollars for a half a cheesesteak is a little much, plus a soda, plus ""freedom"" fries takes it to like 12 bucks. Do they even still call them freedom fries? they are called freedom because, i dont know why? Cause French are pu$$ies thats why!! What a jag off loser assbite Vento must be. Freedom Fries, I'd rather eat at O Sandwiches, and thats just what I do. And Pal Joey, get a fu(king bathroom so all your racists and tourists have somewhere to piss in english cause it annoys me to watch them pretend they want something at O and then make a B line for their toilets. At least O has the sense to make them buy something before probably peeing all over the floor. Hate Hate Hate."
8107,9,1,1,1/2/2009,"HOME OF THE RACIST CHEESE STEAK! I will never purchase another item from this backward ass, minority hating, ignorant son of a bitch punk motherfucker called Joe Vento!!!!!!! This prick is the most racist asshole in Philly's history. He sets us back 40 years with his no English, no service policy. And this shit is coming from an immigrant who spoke no English when he came here! UNBELIEVABLE!! There's pictures of slain policemen with text underneath saying murdered by some black guy. BOY THAT MAKES YOUR MEAL GO DOWN REAL FUCKING SMOOTH!! And I NEVER saw a minority work there ever! What's up with that? This city is more than 55% minorities and he can't find one person of color to work.? He said he hires only family-yeah right do the math! Besides i saw a few Irish guys working there and believe me this racist asshole ain't letting no shanty man in his klan!!! What he needs to do is stop exploiting dead cops and put the same effort in his rubbery cheese steaks as he puts in his warped political views!! AND ALL YOU MINORITIES PURCHASING STEAKS FROM HIM NEED TO BE AWARE O F SOMETHINGS BESIDES YOUR GRUMBLING STOMACH!!"
8108,9,4,1,12/31/2008,"Genos was cool. It was really good. You gotta get the cheesefries and cheesesteak. Parking was okay. I wouldnt park on geno's block b/c u ain't gonna find shit. Park on one of the near side streets and you should find something quickly. The only bad thing is that the line is ridiculous. My friends and I took turns with the 30minute line. Great atmosphere, it seems like mr. geno has it all going on and has frequent celebrity visits to his place. If you're not in a hurry and wanna experience a cool part of philly i would definately reccommend this place."
8109,9,2,1,12/31/2008,"I know there are some people who prefer Geno's over Pat's...and for those people, I must say that you are CRAZY. ˜Absolutely CRAZY. ˜And here's why: I've been to Geno's once or twice before, a long time ago and things haven't changed much. ˜When my coworker and I was scheduled for a training up in King of Prussia, well, we couldn't drive past Philly without a stop at a cheesesteak joint. ˜As my coworker has never been to Philly (uh, how?!?!), I decided that if cheesesteak was what he was craving...well then, we have to do the Geno's/Pat's taste-off. ˜ We start off at Geno's, and there was no one in line. ˜There was no one in front of me, and no one behind me. ˜No one walking up the street to come to Geno's. ˜So there really wasn't a need for the lady behind the counter to get *quite* as snotty as she was, when we didn't know what ""wit"" meant. ˜I mean ""wit"" what (it turns out - it means ""with onions"")? ˜Obviously, we're new here, and as it's not like we're holding up the line, the attitude wasn't really called for. ˜Eh. ˜Whatever. ˜We were hungry. I *LOVE* cheese wiz, and as that is what the original cheesesteak was made with, well that's what I always order (before you doubt me - look it up. ˜I'm right.). ˜My coworker got his with provolone, because he's weird about eating ""plastic cheese"". ˜Whatever. ˜He quickly learned to rue his haute palette, as he bit into his cheesesteak - to find that the cheese was stone-cold and un-melted! ˜Have you ever had unmelted cheese on a cheesesteak? ˜It's not exactly gross, but well, it's not tasty either. ˜There is something about warm, melty, oozy cheese that is part of the cheesesteak experience! To add insult to injury, both of our breads were a *wee* bit on the stale side (not ""3-day-old stale""...more like ""been-left-out-all-day-next-to-the-oven"" stale), and I didn't like that the meat wasn't quite as chopped up as I liked. ˜This reminded me why I stopped coming to Geno's after my second or third visit so long ago. On this trip, we ate at 3 cheesesteak places. ˜Here, Pat's (see my review), and Jim's. ˜I have to say, that this was definitely bottom of the list for both of us. ˜Actually, I ranked this cheesesteak to be about on-par with Jerry's. ˜Yes, you read that right - Jerry's. A NOTE: because of the ""rivalry"" between Pat and Geno's, I find it really hard to write this review without doing a comparison. ˜Normally, I try to avoid comparing one establishment against, another, as each should stand on it's own, however the rivalry between the two is so popular, that it's nearly impossible to eat a cheesesteak from one, without thinking of the other."
8110,9,2,1,12/30/2008,"Never tried Geno's but have heard they are the better of the Pat's and Geno's rivalry. ˜ We waited for about 10 minutes in a fast moving line. What is the deal with ""This is America when ordering speak English"" sign? Last time I checked America has no official legal language. ˜So, who the hell are they to tell me what language to speak and who are they to suggest America has an official legal language? Fact is, if they don't understand the language I speak then I guess they don't have to take my order. Period. ˜I don't need a sign demanding me what language to speak. ugghhh. ˜It seems the owner(s) have a bug up their ass towards non-English speaking customers. Anyway, ˜this is not a even close to a good cheesesteak by any standard let alone Philly standards. The only saving grace for this hunk of slop is the roll. If it wasn't for the roll I would have asked for my money back. ˜This sandwich was at best average. ˜I don't know what all the fuss is about. Obviously, the folks giving this place 4 or 5 stars are tourists/from out town who never had Philly style cheesesteak. and/or anyone who doesn't know what an authentic Philly cheesesteak is. The steak itself was dried-up,bland and leathery. There was hardly no cheez whiz on the sandwich. There was hardly no meat on the roll. You are basically paying 8 bucks for a good roll that cost them less than 10 cents. ˜Obviously, this place is resting on its laurels and is nothing more than a tourist trap serving up scrawny half-assed cheesesteaks and gouging the public. ˜They should be ashamed of themselves to pass off this slop as a Philly cheesesteak. Do yourself a favor and go to Tony Luke's to experience a good Philly cheesesteak. Hell, even Jim's steaks on South street puts out a better sandwich. Those 2 places won't demand you to speak any language and you will surely get a better sandwich. If you like assembly line cheesesteaks made of leathery bland meat and next to no cheese and paying nearly 8 bucks for a good roll this is the place for you."
8111,9,4,1,12/28/2008,"Geno' and Pat's. ˜The big debate. ˜I came here last week for the second time in my life and I wasn't disappointed. ˜I took my brother here since he's been dying to check out the Passyunk Dynasty so we headed off and found our way there. ˜ Parking can get tricky here so try to find a good spot. ˜I always look around the adjacent park to see if there's any free spots. ˜The line wasn't too long when we got there around mid day. ˜I ordered my usual ""wiz with"" meaning I want cheese wiz with onions. ˜I learned that they have a special way of ordering their sandwiches. ˜The cheese wiz sandwich was really tasty. ˜Geno's prides their restaurant on freshness and cleanliness. ˜This wasn't any exception. ˜The sandwich was great and I'd definitely recommend any tourist to check out this place."

8114,9,2,1,12/23/2008,"Ugh....what more can be said about Geno's. A terribly painful on the eyes neon tourist trap at best. You're colon's worst nightmare at worst. Seriously, decided one day while I was in town to get a cheesesteak at either Pat's or Geno's to see what the fuss was all about. Not really caring about one over the other I based my decision on where to go on a coinflip. I soon learned the error of my ways. Ordered a sammich and went on about my business. First, these things are greasy. Like so much that it oozes out and makes paper translucent greasy. That and there was so much fat/gristle on it that I only had a few bites and decided it just wasn't for me. But that's not the worst part. The worst part came after this horrid garbage hit my digestive system. Oh man.....the squirts just barely describes what I went through for the next hour or so. Ouchie. Anyway, giving a 2 star rating because they were pretty friendly, but if you're looking for a ""good"" cheesesteak, head down 95 to Tony Lukes are hit up Jim's on South Street. I would definitely not recommend heading to Geno's."

I'd hear a lot about the place and was anxious to try one of their sandwhiches... The sandwhiches are pretty good and so are the fries but not good enough to make me want to go back. I honestly didn't see what the big fuss was about. ˜Maybe it's just that people enjoy looking at all the pretty pictures while they eat, maybe they like all the bright pretty colors, or maybe it's just the satisfaction of eating under the somewhat controversial name Geno's... ˜Whatever it is, it definately more of a tourist spot than anything, and I'd recommend it to those just looking for a different experience."

8118,9,3,1,12/4/2008,"I had Geno's to-go one time and I think I ate 2 sandwiches they were so good. It was a lot of food but the cheese one the steaks really set it off and I couldn't stop after one. ˜ But I ate so much when I burped, I burped in Spanish and the owner made me puke up my sandwiches and returned my money for not speaking English. ˜I could understand his concern so I didn't have a problem with the situation. This is a must stop for and Philly tourist."
8119,9,1,1,12/2/2008,"I'll never make the mistake of thinking Pat's and Geno's are the same again. ˜Aside from the expected meat, bread, cheese, onions, and grease, customers are force-fed the political opinion of Geno's on topics ranging from Officer Daniel Faulkner to international relations with France. ˜I just want a sandwich at 1:00 AM, if I was interested in political dialog I'd be at City Hall. ˜One more thing, lose the ""Freedom Fries"" already. ˜It was embarrassing in 2003, now it is just sad."
8120,9,1,1,11/30/2008,"There are a couple of things at Geno's that are less than ideal. As others have already mentioned the portions are smaller at Geno's than at Pat's King of Steaks. I don't think it tasted any better than the alternative (Pat's is right across the street), in fact I think it was much harder to swallow given the intolerance to the immigrant population that was marketed at Geno's. I'm ashamed to say that in a recent side-by-side comparison of the two establishments this Thanksgiving weekend that my husband and I didn't leave the line when their intolerance became all too apparent. As you stand in line you can see all kinds of ""patriotic"" propaganda that reeks of small mindedness. I am ashamed to say that I gave them my money. I encourage you not to make the same mistake. Go to Pat's, get a much better tasting sandwich and stand up for the real American dream with your dollars."

Also, ask the server to cut the sandwiches in half so you can share with your friend. That way, you get a taste of both worlds & make the judgment on who makes the best cheesesteak in Philly. After all, competition is fierce & it's all a matter of opinion. Both places are conveniently facing each other diagonally.

(Veggie status can be suspended for momentous occasions - real cheesesteaks in philly certainly qualifies!). ˜The cheesesteaks were good; not extraordinary, but goo, and fun! ˜The cheesefries were really good! ˜I hear Pat's is better so we are already planning our next trip out to Philly to give them a try!"
8128,9,3,1,10/27/2008,i can't say much for this review because i only got their cheese fries here. ˜their cheese fries are super yummy and crunchy. i love how the fries have a nice crisp to it. ˜i wish the day wasn't as cold as when i went though. I would of enjoyed the fries more! haha
8129,9,2,1,10/26/2008,"independence hall, liberty bell, city of brotherly love...whatever. my interests lie strictly in the philly's phood. HAD to stop by geno's. i almost wanted to forgo the bell just to go to geno's. we parked in the neighborhood for free (any free parking in philly is appreciated), and walked the block to geno's, sauntering right past pat's, because there was absolutely no one in line. i made sure to order in english since it seems you'll get denied if you don't. i decided to not taint my steak sandwich with whiz, but instead got provolone. i did whiz my fries though, but i thought it was a bit too salty. i had a good time and in hindsight would've gotten a 'wich from pat's, one from geno's, just to compare. oh well, i don't think i missed much. the line was about 10 deep when we got there, but it took all of 5 minutes. it's an okay sandwich, but i prefer ""gourmet"" type steak sandwiches, with 'shrooms, bell peppers, onions, etc. which is probably sacrilegious to the true philly steak sandwich. i do like the efficiency of their line though. order a sandwich, go to next window to order fries and your drink. simple menu. badda bing, badda boom, you're outta there. the best part? they serve coke AND pepsi! go for the experience."
8130,9,2,1,10/24/2008,"You're drunk... and making your way home....you find your arterial arch nemesis with it's bright lights and the tractor beam of grease and whiz. It's pulling you closer and closer to the window...Your car is illegally parked but you don't care....The line is only 5 or 6 deep..(cue..evil laughter) it's definitely not the best, and it's definitely not the worst, but you compromise....That's right...you compromise your cheesesteak ego and better senses with a quick ˜""whiz with"" ˜which comes out more like a ""Waa waa"" There's no tourists with cameras, no lines creeping out into 9th street on a Sunday afternoon.. You're now part of an elite drunken South Philly Society appearing only at night.....completely trashed and stuffing your face. (designated driver driving of course..lol)"
8131,9,1,1,10/24/2008,had the pork sandwich. it was awful. had better ones in school cafeterias. plus the surly attitude of the staff just makes this a no brainer. SKIP IT AND SAVE YOUR MONEY!
8132,9,5,1,10/20/2008,I need to reiterate how amazing this place is. I am adding two words to my previous review: CHEESE. FRIES.
8133,9,2,1,10/17/2008,"Only really worth visiting for the experience, the roll was good ,the steak was grey and the whiz turned into a yellow dribble from the bottom ( not my bottom ) as i ate. The cheese fries were OK. Probably a great place to go late at night after drinking too much beer.."
8134,9,1,1,10/15/2008,"Meh, I went there about a year ago and I absolutely loved it. ˜I got 'whiz with'. ˜We even walked across the street to Pat's to compare and everyone agreed Geno's was the best. Fast forward a year - I took my boyfriend and a friend from Texas after I raved about how this is the best place to get a true Philly Cheesesteak. ˜Upon my first bite I knew something was wrong. ˜It tasted like crap. ˜My boyfriend and friend immediately asked me if I was drunk the first time I came (and no I was not). ˜It was horrible. ˜The onions seriously smelled like severe body odor. ˜The bread was not as fresh as I would have liked, not even the whiz could mask how bad everything was. I think they should spend less time on the neon lights and the Coney-Islandesque ambiance and focus more on the food. One positive is that it was still agreed that it is better than Pat's (which is a lot greasier and the meat is even worse tasting). ˜But really there is no winner on this block! I recommend you try another place."
8135,9,2,1,10/13/2008,"When we 1st got there the line was out in the middle of the intersection blocking traffic, so I thought maybe this place really is great. The line moved quicker than I thought and and I finally got my food. I must say that the food was ok, nothing to brag about or crave. ˜I've had plenty of cheesesteaks that would blow these away. ˜I think that Subway and Penn Station have better cheesesteaks. ˜As for the price it's about $13 for a philly, fry, and soda(ur paying for the attraction, not good food). ˜Overall Geno's is just a typical tourist attraction and nothing more."
8136,9,3,1,10/7/2008,"As good a cheese steak as I've ever had. ˜Get it with onions and whiz (its a philly thing). A little on the pricey side for whats essentially fast food, with fries and a drink we're talking about 12 bucks, but its worth it once for the true Philly experience."
8137,9,2,1,10/6/2008,"After watching the food network special on pats vs geno's, I decided to take the pepsi challenge on my recent trip to philly. ˜I knew going into it that it most likely wouldn't be much of a challenge but I went in with an open mind. After a few bites into each (actually one bite into each) it was obvious that pats wins hands down. ˜Geno's just doesn't have the right taste and they dont chop their meat. ˜Sorry Geno's but your mass of annoying (and hideous) neon lights, unsanitary conditions, and greazzzzy employees (yes greasy so bad you have to spell it with 5 z's) will forever keep me away from your restaurant."
8138,9,2,1,10/3/2008,"We came here with great expectations and were let down. ˜The place is extremely brightly lit and clean. ˜One can't fault the quality of the food either, but the cheese steak was just north of bland. ˜The cheese fries were better than the steak. ˜We were so disappointed that we head across the street to Pat's, which was much much better. My search for a better Philly Chese Steak in Philly than I can get in California goes on..."
8139,9,1,1,9/29/2008,"I flew into Philly for Memorial Day weekend and we left the airport and went straight here. Yes I love food. As far as cheesesteaks go, I honestly have had better. I feel bad saying that, but I have, at Philly Connection in Duluth, GA. It was nice to go for nostalgia sake though."
8140,9,4,1,9/21/2008,I came here a couple days after I tried Pats in Aug 07. My mom was with me on this trip and we both ordered our sandwiches very quickly and sat down to eat. My mommy ate a 1/4 of her sandwich and I ate half of mine. We took the rest to the airport since we had a 3 hr wait till our flight. I asked my mom what she thought of her sandwich and she thought it was good. This place is alot cleaner than Pats. Some may not agree with Geno's politics but hey were in AMERICA and I was hear to eat a Philly cheesesteak.... This place was the better of the two.....Next time I am back here I will try D'Alessandro's .....
8141,9,1,1,9/18/2008,"Racist Racist Racist!! I really don't like to see sign like ""please speak English"" or ""management have right to reserve or refuse the service"" stupid things like that by the cashier, who the hell you think you are?? Plus the sandwich is pretty much, well, fucking whack! Not worth it!"
8142,9,3,1,9/17/2008,"The food alone is worth four stars, but the attitude is enough for me to dock one star. This is an excellent cheese steak, no doubt about it. Although it ranks third among the Big Three (Jim's, Pat's, and Geno's) for me, I'd still happily eat this steak forever if I had to. The onion topping is great, and the option to get birch beer is a great touch. ˜The steaks are easily the smallest among the Big Three, but the taste is still excellent. ˜I prefer ""Provy wit"" (provolone cheese with onions), which isn't the classic Philadelphia style, but I did try the ""Whiz wit"" today, and I thought it was a unique taste. Very flavorful, but the taste of Whiz just isn't my thing. The fries are quite good, but nothing really special. Now, for the attitude. They strongly support the Philadelphia police force, which I obviously have no problem with. ˜But they do it to a point where it's just invasive of the friendly eating environment that I prefer. Also, they feel very strongly that everyone in America should speak English all the time, as supported by their semi-famous ""Speak English"" campaign, complete with t-shirts. ˜This is typical American egotism and it outrages me. I feel like a lot of the blue-collar heart of Philadelphia shares this attitude and it makes me glad I left. ˜If you look at a photo that I uploaded, you will see a hilariously ironic message on the owner's vehicle, which reads as follows: ˜ ˜Joey Vento say's [sic] this is America! ""Speak English"" Hey Joey, maybe you should go ahead and learn English before you start pushing it on people who haven't been surrounded by it since the day they were born."
8143,9,1,1,9/17/2008,a tourist trap ... meat is dry and skimpy in quantity...u must order in AMERICAN which apparently is a language now....it 's only saving grace is it is not ˜tony luke's..eating a tony luke steak is like watching a 24 hour loop of michael phelp's SNL performance...
8144,9,3,1,9/15/2008,"I drug myself to this joint by my fingernails. ˜I was in a bad place, but needed to taste as much of the scene as possible. ˜Now I am near death, and I have sampled nowhere near enough.... But this is a fine sammich. ˜This is a fine cheese steak. ˜Just not like Pats"
8145,9,3,1,9/11/2008,I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see so many negative reviews for this place. ˜I am not a cheesesteak expert by any means but I certainly enjoyed this one more than Pat's as we went there 1st and here 2nd. ˜I liked the bread and meat better here. ˜I also felt a lot better after drinking tons of alcohol at a wedding the night before.
8146,9,1,1,9/11/2008,For all the hype I've heard about this place I expected a whole lot more. The steak wasn't bad but just wasn't great! I think I've had better cheesesteaks in NY and Cali.
8147,9,3,1,9/10/2008,Bread: nice and soft! Onion topping: excellent Cheese whiz: salty Steak: very good Fries: bland Staff: very nice...gave us pens (we must've looked really touristy) I've been here twice in the afternoon and have never had to wait long. ˜I think I'm swaying more towards Geno's than Pat's.
8148,9,1,1,9/2/2008,"All flash, no substance. ˜My friend and I joined the debate between Geno's and Pat's... yeah, Geno's was not that good. ˜The sandwiches looked pretty sad.... hell you couldn't even tell that it was a philly cheese steak, unless someone told you. ˜My friend and I split an original with whiz. ˜Yeah, not impressed. ˜I think I could've gone to subway and been more satisfied. Bottom line- tourist trap. ˜Take a picture, but then walk across the street to get a quality cheese steak. Chuck Norris Rating- purple nurple... to the nurples"
8149,9,2,1,8/21/2008,"I'd skip Geno's and walk around the corner to Pat's - or better yet - go to Jim's. Or Tony Luke's. Or Pastificio's for the real deal. Let me just add that I am NOT a cheessteak eater - I get a Chicken Cheesesteak 'wit Provolone and 'shrooms once or twice a year. Geno's is filthy and to quote below - the owner is a racially prejudiced ""ass clown""."
8150,9,2,1,8/20/2008,"Geno's is something to try if you are around, but completely overrated. The lines can be very long (+45 min) and the food mediocre. I've tried the steaks with all three types of cheeses - Wiz, American, and Provolone. I liked Wiz the best for the flavor. The bread was soft, while the meat was pretty tough, in huge slices, and sparse. Of the age old question of Geno's or Pat's, I prefer Pat's, as they have a larger menu and a lot more [tender, chopped] meat."
8151,9,3,1,8/18/2008,"3 = really average. I liked the wiz. Other than that, the sandwich was pretty blas?. Definitely overrated, although better than Pat's. ˜My comparison review: My comparison review of Genos v. Pats: Despite their poor reviews on Yelp for being over priced, less than spectacular, and staffed by greasy men with the unique streak of arrogance borne of notoriety, we felt that experiencing the origins of the 'steak would be more rewarding than tracking down steakeries more highly regarded by the on-line community. So off to South Philly we ventured. We had been warned by other steak hunters that the area inhabited by the legendary steakeries was dilapidated and dangerous- so we were happily surprised to find them located in a vibrant community reminiscent of the San Francisco Mission (except with a lot less Latinos and a lot more Italians.) Arriving unmolested, we broke into teams to procure steaks from each of the shops (without out having to stand in both the long winding lines sequentially.) Our team went to Geno's, while Priscilla, Tammy and Sam went to Pat's to pick up our steaks. Geno's was interestingly decorated in photo's of the owner and his son posing with scantily-clad, skanky looking women and various celebs, as well as over the top pro-American propaganda and anti-immigrant rhetoric. I was warned by a woman in line that I must order our steaks with the whiz. Apparently it caused quite an uproar when John Kerry failed to order the traditional ""South Philly,"" from Geno's- note that Pat's doesn't serve the whiz, so apparently the style only represents the north corner of the intersection, rather than all of South Philly. When I returned to our seats, team 2 had already procured our steaks from Pats. Apparently some confusion had occurred during ordering, and we now had in our possession 7 steaks- 4 from Pats, and 3 from Genos. Both steaks were pretty basic- thin strips of steak with onions on bland French rolls; Pat's came with the traditional Provolone and Geno's with the aforementioned Cheese Whiz. I started by eating one half of a Pat's steak. It was decent, but uninspiring. Several members of the expedition complained that Pat's Steaks were too dry. While not overly moist, I didn't share their concern; however the flavor was lacking in my opinion. Pat's Steaks were very bland in flavor, reminding me of my own creations before I got down with Montreal seasoning and fresh garlic. The cheese was also lacking in flavor. Next, I moved onto a Geno's steak, with the Whiz. I was intrigued by the flavor and consistency of the Whiz; the steak was juicier than Pat's and the Whiz and grease mixed into thin cheese-gravy that soaked the otherwise bland roll. The meat was similarly bland to that of Pat's, but the flavor of the Whiz compensated for the most part. I ended up consuming about 2.5-3 steaks in various portions in the sitting, as a excess had been ordered and various members of the expedition were unable to complete their missions, so I feel that I am qualified to end the age old debate as to who makes the best Cheese Steak: Consensus amongst the group was that Geno's made the better steak of the two, but Geno's lost points due to the quasi-racist vibe, and at least 1 member of the expedition didn't care much for the Whiz. If we had spent more than a single night in Philly, we would have undoubtedly searched for less famous, but more delectable competition, but unfortunately we left the City of Brotherly love disappointed by the over-hyped, over-rated 'steaks. Mike's Ratings: (On a scale from 1-5, 5 being perfect and 1 being inedible.) Cheese Steak Shop: 4.5-5 (Great tasting, but pretty expensive. I require a 15' to fully satisfy my hunger) Geno's: 3-3.5 (Tasty, also too damn expensive) Pat's: 2.5-3 (Very bland, I can do better at home.) Vanessa's Ratings: Cheese Steak Shop: 5 (""Yummy!"") Geno's: 3.5 (""I wouldn't go out of my way to stand in that line & he's racist."") Pat's: 2 (""It was too dry."") I didn't care much for Geno's arrogance either."
8152,9,3,1,8/16/2008,"I'd give a 3.5 because I tried Pat's next door and liked that better. ˜This restaurant is impossible to miss because of it's 10 million neon lights. You'd think you were in Vegas! Anyway, I just got a cheese steak with American cheese. The meat was lean but it didn't have that much flavor. The bread was okay also. ˜Be careful of their hot sauce because it really is HOT!"
8153,9,1,1,8/8/2008,"ok. i was visiting home with friends from the bay and on this particular day we just so happened to go to hershey park waaaaay late in the day due to some unforeseen lagging. we got to hershey around 3 but went to sonic's for lunch to kill time til 5 so we could pay half price. we didn't leave the park til closing and people we pretty hungry. what to eat in pennsylvania... oh! yes. philly cheesesteaks. i called my friend jen who just moved there and recommended either geno's or pat's. we weathered traffic and full bladders and even a busted GPS that took us to a cemetary instead of a wawa... it was 2AM but dammit we made it too far to give up. straight out of harold & kumar, it seems... only when they got their white castle, they loved it. shoulda gone to white castle! we thought we were going the wrong way in a neighborhood comparable to newark, nj or oakland, ca. but BAM. lights. we picked geno's coz of the lights, i gotta say. we just came from vegas a few days beforehand, and the lights were pretty and symbolized some sort of haven from the surrounding ghetto. what a disappointment. i was expecting this huge greasy monster heartattack of a sandwich. instead, i got something you could pay a dollar for in a vending machine. i bet it would have tasted better too. it was a cheesesteak alright... but to capture the essence of an authentic philadelphia cheese steak like other places around the area so flawlessly do... it did not. geh. they sell crappy sandwiches validated by pictures with celebrities... but i bet all those people thought the same thing i did. 7 bucks for this piece of shhhhhh... shhhhoulda gone elsewhere. oh yes, and beware of the signs. they'd like you to order in english because you're in america. they'd also like you to know that Mumia Abul Jamal ""murdered"" Officer Daniel Faulkner. there are some pretty biased posters and signs up all over the place. google it ... i'm sure they won't want you to. diversity. another reason why i love the bay."
8154,9,4,1,8/6/2008,"Maybe I haven't eaten cheesesteaks enough, but if there is a difference between the two, I can't tell. I tell people I like Geno's better, but I can't come up with a concrete reason why I do. I just did and it really doesn't make sense. I would suggest for any visitors to Philly to just try both. They are right across the street from each other, so it's not very problematic. Pat's is a little grungier looking than Geno's but whatever."
8155,9,1,1,8/3/2008,"It's not worth the effort to put forth another review after Pat's. Frankly, there is little to no difference between the two places; one looks like a prostitute and the other looks like one with some make-up and better clothes. If you ask me which is better, Pat's or Geno's, I can't give you a proper answer because it's like making me choose between the clap or genital herpes."
8156,9,3,1,8/1/2008,"Super flashy and bright-- can't miss this place. It looked like VEGAS from afar. The cheesesteaks were slightly bigger than Pat's, but the steaks was a bit more saucy which made it soggy and drippy. The bread was alot softer compared to Pat's. ˜I don't live in philly, but i thought this place wasn't too shabby! I think i like Pat's better though. Review for Pat's will come soon. :-D"
8157,9,1,1,7/31/2008,1st place to sell philly cheesesteaks multiple celebrity pictures quick philly service decent fries not good philly cheesesteak....
8158,9,1,1,7/31/2008,"Worse than Pat's. ˜Big signs, controversy, long lines, bad meat, bad rolls, annoying policies, expensive. ˜Why go? Read my Pat's review if you want something more in-depth."
8159,9,2,1,7/25/2008,"Being tourists from out of town we thought we would do the touristy thing and make a trip out to Genos. I'm not really sure why I gave it three stars. ˜The line was long, we were basically standing in the middle of the road, then when you get to order your steak they are like cheese steak nazi's. ˜The sandwich itself tastes pretty good (I had a whiz without, DW had american with) except there is next to no meat on the roll. ˜They should legitimately charge about $3 - $4 for what they give you but being the tourist mecca that they are they get you for $7. ˜Now that I've written this I realize that I really didn't have that much good to say about the whole experience so I downgraded it to 2 stars."
8160,9,2,1,7/24/2008,"The lighted signs at Geno's are so gaudy I don't know if i should be ordering cheesesteak or be putting down bets on a craps game. They are very particular about how you order, as if what you get is that good. I agree though that the store is very clean. On to the food. They go a little light on the steak at Geno's. This means both in terms of overall mass as well as greasiness. The steak is used sparingly and it is dry and a bit tough to eat. Best to order with cheese whiz, since its really dry otherwise. My advice is to avoid this little corner of cheesesteak nation (Pat's across the street is barely any better). Jim's is a slight step up and Tony Luke's is a leap above. To note, Geno's teeters dangerously close to 1 star territory."
8161,9,3,1,7/23/2008,"I pulled a Guy Fieri and visited this famous cheesesteak intersection to see which I prefered. Of the two in the famous rivalry, I think I prefered Geno's to Pat's, but that's just because I got it with Cheese Whiz. Trust me on this point, out-of-towners: Get the Whiz. It sounds gross but it's really not bad. The upshot of my little adventure tells me I've had better Phillys in Philly. Worth a visit to gawk."
8162,9,2,1,7/22/2008,"Geno who is really Joe started with $6.00 in his pocket when he first opened his business. ˜His wife and son named their first born son Geno who now works with his father. ˜I thought that was a cool story to share. My visiting daughter and family wanted to try some ""famous cheesesteaks"", so off we went to the two big rivals, right across the street from each other. ˜The family was all waiting for my daughter and I at Pat's, while we were at Geno's. I'll start with first impressions: My daughter desperately needed to use the restroom and Pat's told her to go over to the park adjacent from them! ˜We did and there was no restroom! ˜Geno's was right there, so we asked them and they slipped her into the back and left her piddle. She came out saying wow this place is so clean! Now we get to friendliness, cleanliness and decor. ˜Pat's is old and dirty and has not spent one dime of their profits to stand out in these three fields. ˜Geno's on the other hand has put a lot into these areas. Now for the cheesesteaks: ˜Even though we were all headed to Pat's, my daughter and I were so impressed with Geno's that we ordered our steak and fries there. The other five in our party stayed at Pat's. My daughter and I took our order from Geno's over to Pat's to eat with the others ( tacky for sure and I would have rather ate at Geno's because of the cleanliness and decor). ˜ First of all to order a sandwich and fries at Geno's, you must order them and pay for them separately at 2 different windows, ˜I can see where this works for them at busy times, but we were the only ones there. ˜ The meat at Geno's is much, much better than at Pat's. ˜Everyone, but my stubborn son in law agreed. ˜The bread is better at Pat's. ˜The onions are raw at Geno's and sauteed at Pat's. ˜With a grilled sandwich I would have preferred the sauteed, but I did order a cheesesteak hoagie, so that may be the reason. ˜Pat's uses more cheese. ˜I had provolone. All in all, if you add it all up, Geno's definitely has the better of the two cheesesteaks and wins hands down for decor, cleanliness and friendliness."
8163,9,2,1,7/20/2008,"after watching what seemed like a thousand pat's vs. geno's stories on the food network, i had to put my moral principles of not eating meat aside and get in on some of this cheesesteak action. while in philly, do what the philly-ians do. philly-pinos? philly-ites? anyway, yes, the food network made me do it. what a waste of giving up moral principles! i mean, i have to admit, ˜it was all kind of fun - a huge line and me hoping that pat and geno themselves would throw down in the middle of the intersection. alas, no throwing down was had. le sigh. the sandwich itself wasn't anything spectacular. you've got meat and cheese on bread. whoo-wee. (also, to assuage my moral guilt, i took out most of the meat, only keeping two thin slices. hmm. in hindsight, i guess i should have just bitten the bullet and eaten all the meat). the fries, however, were delicious. super super good fries. also, we chose geno's because the line seemed shorter - but frankly, i kind of liked the flashy las vegas feel to it, too. i was so easily tricked! i gave away $10 of my hard-earned money to support xenophobia and cops (i don't have anything against cops, per se - i am just a critical and aware citizen. rampart scandal/rodney king/sean bell anybody?) all these moral principles, down the drain. but thanks for the flash, geno. it was entertaining."
8164,9,2,1,7/19/2008,"The 2nd best cheesesteak at the intersection, which puts it at about #83 overall in the region. The meat isn't good, the rolls aren't good, and all the lights and whatnot are just way too over-the-top. But, still, I've had worse. A tourist trap and nothing more."
8165,9,1,1,7/19/2008,"Under normal circumstances, I am no where near being a meat eater, but since sarah i. was in town, we had to do the whole ""philly touristy"" things (lots of fobby camera action ncluded) and eat the infamous cheesesteaks. However, after about 30 min. in line, entertaining ourselves with old tacky celeb pictures and anit-immigrant, patriotism letters hung on the walls, we were quite disappointed! ˜ Shame on Britney and J.T. for dining here. More importantly, shame on me and Sarah I. for eating meat at Geno's! yack!"
8166,9,2,1,7/16/2008,"My first time in Philly, I told myself that I had to try one of their famous cheesesteaks. ˜This was actually a number of years ago when I went and Yelp was not quite born yet. ˜ So I had to rely on some other places to pick my Cheesesteak destination. ˜So I did my research and it came down to the 2 legends in the Philly area, Pat's and Geno's and what luck I had, they were across the street from each other. ˜So once I got to Philly, all I had to do was drive to the intersection and then I could decide then where to go. ˜ I picked the wrong place!!! ˜Pat's was the dirty looking place WITH a line and Geno's was the cleaner looking place WITHOUT a line... ˜I'll try my best not to make that mistake again. ˜ Well, next time I am in Philly, guess I'll still have to try Pat's even the reviews for Pat's is not all that either but damn, these 2 places are part of the Philly culture and 1 definitely did not hit the mark so I gotta take my chances with the other..... ˜ But I do definitely think I better have a couple other choices I better plan on going to try some Philly Cheesesteak.... ˜ I don't have any plans in the near future to visit Philly so I do have some time......"

The meat is not at all choppy and is cooked to perfection. It is also the first pork sandwich that actually got a compliment from my father...which is an astonishment in itself. The staff is always courteous to patrons and to police as well. There are always fallen officer fundraisers going on, which I respect a lot. Whether you like the Philadelphia Police or not you have to respect what he does for the ones who unfortunately lost their lives bringing down some piece of shit who likes to terrorize our neighborhoods. I also love watching the old Italian men gather around in the morning for their sandwich and coffee, shooting the breeze on the well lit benches that bring me that ""shore feeling"" on a sunny day. ˜ I can deal without the clientele ˜on most days, but on those hungry afternoons of heavy drinking they are the perfect bike ride away."
8169,9,1,1,7/6/2008,"My classmates and i tried 5 different cheese steaks places during our ""cheese steak crawl"" and Geno's & Pat's where the worst two. ˜ They are both too greasy, their bread is crap and they give you much less meat than other places (e.g. Cosmi's)"
8170,9,3,1,6/30/2008,"Eh. This was no better than their competition across the way. I gave it an extra star cause the place was spotless. I am lovin' those clean places. The steak was ok, but my bread was kind of hard. Give me some wizzzzzzzz. Limpy fries. ˜=o"
8171,9,3,1,6/16/2008,"You go because you've got to. It's a Philly tradition along with Pat's. My BF & I went and got a cheese steak from each, split 'em up and critiqued them. It was a fun exercise for his first Philly trip. After you do that once you can go down to Jim's and get a great cheesesteak."
8172,9,3,1,6/15/2008,I had a good experience when I went there and I enjoyed my cheese steak very much.
8173,9,1,1,6/14/2008,"gross. you have to be drunk to even consider eating it. and what i hate the most about this place, is that tourist make a point of going here. now they leave philly thinking that is a cheesesteak. and this is what philly is known for. ˜i have given in to eating it a couple times at stupid o'clock in the morning. like i said before, the only time geno's sounds like a good idea. even in my state, it still tastes like cardboard. any corner pizza place is better. oh, i drove by today, it was 8 deep of the most unattractive people i have ever seen. ha"
8174,9,3,1,6/14/2008,"Another Philly Cheese Steak spot in South Philly, across the street of Pat's. Try Geno's theirs is not bad, you are here anyways, so why not.. at least you know what you're talking 'bout. when you had this one too. I think this is more the'trendy yuppie type of PCS' spot with all the lights trying to attract you. But again always worth a try, some disagree with me and say this is the PCS they prefer."
8175,9,2,1,6/14/2008,"I had a dream once that my childhood house in Manayunk was swept up by a tornado and was casted to a magical world where had landed on the wicked witch of East Passyunk. Lucky me. Greeted by people shouting ""Speak English!"" and ""Sopranos!"". Dizzy with confusion a middle-aged woman sporting a coffee in sweatpants saying ""Juicy"" where the sun don't shine tells me if I want to return home I need to find the ""Whiz of Geno's"". But beware of the ""King of Steaks"". The people tell me to follow the ""Pash E. Unk Road"" and with my lil' dog we journey down the magical street passing tanning spas, realtors, salons, cheese shops, gyms and more tanning spas. After befriending a smelly old man, a drunken Eagle's fan, and an illegal alien we arrive to a tower of neon proportions complete with a blown-up photograph of a cheese steak. As we approach an angry beast wielding a spatula blocks our path. ""You must be the King of Steaks"" I state and the man smirks and replies ""I'll make you an offer you can't refuse. I'll toss in some free fries."" It was a good offer but not good enough... ""NEVER!"" and I turn to whisper in the Eagle's fan ear. The fan goes ape shit ˜and pummels at what was the ""King of Steaks"". Now what did I say in his ear you might ask? ""We won the Super Bowl."" At last the quest is finished. ""What do you want?"" cries out a man behind the counter. ""The Whiz please!"" I said with confidence as he hands me a cheese steak made with 100% whiz. ""Oh... this is it? What a rip off!"" ""Well just click your heels together fag!"" shouts the smelly old man. ""Que?"" asks the illegal alien. So I do and everyone laughs at me for wearing ruby slippers, clicking my heels, outside of ""Geno's"" at 2am. The only problem about this dream is that it is not a dream. This place, this Oz, this timeless void does exist. It's open day and night all year round for you. Come and experience it for yourself. Be mesmerized by the sheer audacity of it all. This is as close to the ""American Dream"" as you are going to get. Grab a steak wrapped in a copy of the ""Declaration of Independence"" for your educational purposes. There is so much to gain. (Waistline that is.)"
8176,9,4,1,6/12/2008,"I'm a convert. For many years, I have been loyal to Pats as the one and only for the best cheese steak sandwich in Philly. ˜Not to be disloyal but I recently decided that the competition was worth looking at, trying and judged once more. Yes, the taste test was ON. The ride took awhile being that it was memorial day weekend... we were 6 very hungry adults by the time we got there. ˜Then came the first glance. ˜It was long and not pretty. ˜I'm talking about the line. The strategy was simple. ˜Divide and conquer. ˜We split into two groups and would buy enough sandwiches so that each person could split and have .5 of Pats, .5 of Genos. ˜ The Genos was wit onions and cheese wiz. ˜While I'm not a fan of artificial and gooey unnatural cheese, I'm a fan of taste. ˜Get the cheese wiz. ˜Not question about that. ˜The beef is sliced thinly and placed instead of shoved into the bread. ˜That made it chewier... nevertheless, Genos was declared the winner by all that day. Can I admit to you that I had an entire Genos sandwich? ˜They were wondering why there was an entire Pats sandwich left.... Minus one star for the long wait and bad fries. ˜For fries, go to Pats. ˜Just split up and conquer!"
8177,9,2,1,6/12/2008,"It's an interesting contrasting image when you arrive on the this corner and see the bright neon lights of Geno's philly steaks with dimmer look to Pat's philly steaks down the street. My friends and I couldn't decide between the two, so 2 of us went to Geno's and 2 of us went to Pat's. ˜The difference I noticed was Pat's had more options in your sandwich and their fries are A LOT better because it was warm, crisp, and full. ˜Geno's fries were smaller and lack any substance. ˜Their bread was flat and steaks were softer than Pat's but tasteless... the only thing I could taste was their spicy sauce. My advice: ˜go over to Pat's instead but don't expect too much either."
8178,9,1,1,6/7/2008,"DO NOT GO TO GENO'S STEAKS. IT IS RUN/OWNED BY A BIGOTED, RACIST PIECE OF HUMAN FILTH. First I'll discuss THAT...then the food. Geno's is notorious because a short while ago owner Joey Vento posted up signs that said he would refuse to provide service to people who ordered in any language other than English. It said """"This is America. When ordering please speak English."" A discrimination complaint was filed with the city of Philadelphia and Vento defended his racist, discriminatory policy in court. He claims he has a problem with the current immigration situation in the United States, and that his sign was an issue of free speech. He's right, of course; he can SAY whatever he wants as long as he doesn't actually deny customers because they speak a foreign language, or treat them badly because of it. However his sign belies a deeper problem: Joey Vento believes that if your first language is anything other than English, you aren't an ""American."" He believes that real Americans speak English. This is both ignorant and false, and coming from the son of Italian immigrants it makes it doubly offensive. Vento is PROUD of his racist hate message. He distributes pens from that say ""Proud to be an American""; next to this is a photo of him smiling and pointing at a sign that says ""Management reserves the right to refuse service."" Guess what, Mr. Vento? That old chestnut ""We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason...""? It's an old wives' tale. There are lots of reasons why it is COMPLETELY ILLEGAL to refuse service to someone, and their race is one of them - along with gender, religion, political view and many more. There are plenty of reasons not to eat at Geno's Steaks in Philadelphia; another good reason is that the food tastes like horsecrap. It is truly a tourist cesspool that draws people in with big neon signs; I live three blocks away and frequently I have to detour around another block when going out to run errands because the line at Geno's runs around the corner. The bottom line is, if you eat at Geno's, in addition to getting food that tastes like it was crapped onto a plate for your enjoyment, you are also supporting a filthy racist bigot."
8179,9,3,1,6/5/2008,"After Pat's we went to Geno's. It was somewhat better. The bread was tastier, the onions more savory and the steak more tender. We went for whiz directly. It was great in a fat ass artery clogging way. Deeeelicious junk food. So ˜good in fact so we took two to go-one for the trip home and one for a friend. Not so into the obnoxious decor and flagrant cop ass kissing tributes but the steaks were good. And they gave us free Joey Vento pens. Yay. Gag. genosteaks.com"
8180,9,2,1,5/29/2008,"For years I have been hearing about Pat's and Geno's. ˜Flying from San Diego to Philly all I could think about was sinking my teeth into the thinly sliced steak smothered with the best condiment ever created (Cheese Whiz) the anticipation was killing me. ˜So soon as I got off the long flight my friend and I drove straight there stomach growling the whole way. Finally I could see the neon lights from a distance and my mouth started to water. I decided to start with half of ˜""Whiz, wit"" at Pat's and then half of the same from Geno's after the first bite of each I realized what I have been fantasizing about for the last 5 hours on my flight was all for nothing it was just OK I can honestly can say I have made better cheese steaks in my dorm room back in the day with a George Foreman grill and Steak-Umms. Besides the OK flavor of the meat at both joints I would have to say Geno's had better bread but less meat and If I had to decide between the two I would say Geno's but probably only because the cheese whiz covered up the bland taste of the meat. But if you love food it is a great landmark to visit but beware don't go into it thinking it will be the best thing you have ever sunk your teeth in..."
8181,9,3,1,5/28/2008,"This was my 2nd Cheese steak of my trip. There is a huge line you have to stand in but it moves quickly. Ordering is pretty simple and there are not many options so it's easy to get what you want. I got a Cheese steak with provolone and onions. The bread was good and onions tasty. The meat could have more flavor and be less soggy. I got the cheese fries and they were good too. There really isn't much room for sitting and eating, you might have to go sit on the cement wall across the street. Overall I liked it and I would go here again."
8182,9,1,1,5/26/2008,"this place sucks ... meat's not marinated, bread is soggy, tasteless ... ˜Go to the Great Steak Escape at your local shopping mall instead."

8184,9,1,1,5/22/2008,I don't think their cheese steaks have enough meat...also the bread was too hard...too bad this was my FIRST philly cheesesteak after moving here.....i dont think i'll be back again
8185,9,3,1,5/21/2008,"So after all the back and forth between Geno's and Pat's, I chose Geno's...Geno's was good, but it wasn't great. ˜The steak itself was a little flavorless, but the bread/roll was good and the cheese was also a great addition. ˜Honestly, you can go to any street vendor or mall and also find cheesesteaks with the same quality. ˜I say, if you can go to Geno's, then go, but don't make it a destination since it's not really fantastic."
8186,9,2,1,5/21/2008,"Greasy, boiled meat of which there was little of in my cheesesteak. Culturally offensive signs in the windows. Annoying 2 tier ordering system."
8187,9,1,1,5/16/2008,"If I could give them a 1, I would. I had to try it the first time I went to Pat's, even though my Philly friends warned me not to. ˜It was the worst cut of meat I have ever tried. ˜Very tough and just not something that is made for human consumption. ˜A bunch of retards working there too that put themselves above those that don't speak English. ˜Avoid this place and go get the best cheesesteak you'll ever have across the street at Pat's.

8188,9,1,1,5/5/2008,"can i give a no star rating? lets find out. honestly, i cant believe i'm reviewing this shithole before pats, but here we are, first of all, NEVER GO HERE, EVER! for one thing ( and never forget this) pats invented the cheese steak and at some point after that genos opened across the street. i have been to both pats and genos and i did always enjoy the OG better, plus pats does not burn your fucking retinas in the way genos does. you can argue that being in america, people should speak english, sure, but they dont always and the owners forefathers didnt and maybe in NEW JERSEY where that ass lives, everyone does, but in south philly where i live and where lots of mexicans live and where there are a shit ton of tourists FROM OTHER COUNTRIES not everyone does, so deal with it. anyway, this place has a cheese steak as lousy as anywhere, and ˜its about as real as mexican food from taco bell. i hope i can keep one philadelphian or tourist from visiting this copycat craphole. turns out, i do have to give at least one star."
8189,9,1,1,4/27/2008,"Ich spreche deutsch, ich kann kein cheesesteak kaufen. really, go to JandJ's up the street for a better one. ˜i think geno's and pat's feed the cows they use a diet of lard. cheesesteaks are not healthy but i think i saw a 3 yr old have a heartattack there.faaattttyyyy. i'll take less fat and bigotry witout geno's please."
8190,9,3,1,4/23/2008,I had to give this a try to see what the hype is all about. ˜I must say that philly cheesesteaks (even the chicken) are pretty yummy. ˜The placed was packed! ˜I didn't like how they had the picture of the officer (supposedly) killed by Mumia Abu-Jamal. ˜ We didn't have time to go across the street to try Pat's. ˜Maybe next time I'm in the city of brotherly love.
8191,9,3,1,4/16/2008,"If you have to choose between Pat's and Geno's, go for Geno's NO QUESTION! ˜This doesn't mean I like their food, just that between the two tourist traps, Joey Vento's is better. While I don't eat at this restaurant, Vento is a good guy who has done great things for the city. ˜Apparently, being a good person and standing up for what you believe in can make you a whole lot of enemies. ˜I always prefer keeping politics and food separate, and I do so in my business. ˜Vento is very supportive of the police and he chooses to show it. ˜The English issue is a no brainer. ˜Anyone who thinks otherwise has either a sub 90 IQ or is just an anti-American hater."
8192,9,3,1,4/15/2008,"it's geno's, man. it is what it is, you know?? when the in-laws come up, we always drag 'em here for the steak-y action. i tend to go with the provolone, as whiz is an abomination unto my stomach, while the in-laws and family members all go with whiz. the cheese fries are ridiculously good. try your steak with some relish and brown mustard....that shit is fantastic!"
8193,9,1,1,4/13/2008,"Pat's does everything slightly better, plus Pat's has history, so from a food standpoint there is no point in going here. From a principles standpoint, it gets even bleaker. The neon signs are absurd, ugly, distasteful, ruinous really. The owner, Joey Vento, is a racist arrogant prick who loves all the attention his antics bring him. And my biggest turnoff is all the police propaganda outside the store on the walls. Seriously, I'm here for food, not a diatribe on Mumia abu-Jamal. There's just too much to not like about this place."
8194,9,4,1,4/12/2008,"In Philly on travel decided to do a taste-off between Genos and Pats. After reading the other reviews I was prepared to be disappointed. But instead I was thrilled. Perhaps they recognized me as as visiting foodie and whipped out their special meltingly tender, fabulously tasty steak (with whiz and onions) while secretly sending a grisly tough and tasteless sandwich over to Pats. However, at least today, it was no contest. Genos sandwich was a fabulous, messy, delicious guilty pleasure. ˜Pats tasted like bad high school cafeteria food. Lets be clear ˜- this is a cheese steak. So 4 stars needs to be taken in that context. But Geno's sandwich rocked. At least in the eyes of a sober, ex NYer."
8195,9,1,1,4/8/2008,"awful. unchopped and gristly meat with a side of ignorance, all soaked in that burning 24hr neon glow."
8196,9,1,1,4/8/2008,VOM! - It was all grissle and fat. I hate this place.
8197,9,3,1,4/8/2008,ok first off - you cannot eat these sober - that should be rule #1. after you leavea club or bar and have that 2-3am buzz going these are the greatest things on earth - but going sober is a totally different story. once you bite into it for the love of god do not open the bread and look at the meat! for sober steaks go to tony luke's
8198,9,1,1,4/8/2008,"Yes, my friends and I actually made a day trip to Philly from Ithaca just to grub. The highlight of the trip was supposed to be Delilah's but for lunch we did the Pat's vs. Geno's bit. I don't really like Philly Cheesesteaks but I approach eating like it's my business (which it sort of is considering my major) and eating a cheesesteak in Philly, blah blah blah. I didn't set great expectations but I figured Philly and its sandwiches had to raise my impressions of cheesesteaks by a notch or two. Turns out not so much. We tried Geno's first. The place looks newer than Pat's but it looks like a Harley Davidson dealer. The line was all the way out into the street but it moved pretty quickly. My friends and I split the cheez whiz one and got a racist pen as a bonus...Double yuck. Might as well call it clogged arteries topped with disgrace-to-all-real-cheese with a supersized side of ˜bigotry. Everything about this experience was distasteful."
8199,9,1,1,4/4/2008,"I first tried their steaks in the 80s; didn't like it. ˜Went back this decade with a crew shooting tourism shots. ˜They bought lunch, but I went to La Lupe's instead. ˜Still don't like the texture of the meat. ˜I prefer it to be chopped more finely. ˜Didn't like the rolls, either. The exterior is garish, with all that orange and neon. ˜It's embarrassing to stand near it. ˜I'd rather get a cheesesteak at a low-key place. ˜And the shrine to fallen police officers just feels disingenuous--or maybe it feels aggressive. ˜I don't know, it just doesn't feel right--and I DO support civil servants and appreciate their sacrifices. ˜I just don't think that they should be remembered by putting their faces next to a giant neon sandwich, where tourists will drop orange litter by their names. ˜They deserve better. ˜And we all deserve a better cheesesteak.

8200,9,1,1,4/1/2008,"Out of all the places to get a cheesesteak in this cheesesteak capital, I loathe Geno's the most. It's gross. Simple as that. Even if I'm drunk and have burned all my taste buds off, it's still gross."
8201,9,3,1,3/31/2008,"Yep, I'm an out of towner trying to do the whole tourist thing while on business. ˜I think people are expecting way too much from this shop. ˜I came here looking for incredibly gut wretching heart hurting food. ˜And boy, this place really satisfied my need for it. ˜In fact, they should put a surgeon warning on this place that you should probably be an athlete to handle the potential artery clogging food that they serve here. ˜After scoffing one of these sandwiches down and dousing it with a side of cheese fries, I was KO'ed in a coma back at my hotel room. If you're obese or have high cholesterol, think twice about going here, unless you're looking for a happy mouth watering suicide. I'm sure I could run my car with the table top kitchen grease of this place. ˜ Otherwise indulge in your thousands of years of human evolution to seek out fatty food. :( and -star for sign, but I'm not going to get all butt hurt and cry about it."
8202,9,1,1,3/28/2008,"Thanks for serving a great portion of heart attack on a plate! ˜Sandwich is greasy and yucky. I would give it negative stars for the inappropriate signage (this is America, please order in English). ˜Well Joe or Geno or whatever this clown's name is, I guess his ancestors knew English when they jumped over to Ellis Island from Italy!

8203,9,3,1,3/26/2008,"The ever-lasting Cheesesteak. No tourist's trip to Philadelphia would be complete without one. For my first visit, I chose Geno's over Pat's, based on my friend's recommendation and the glowing neon Orange Americana of it all. The actual cheesesteak was...pretty boring honestly. Seriously...I never understood the big deal anyways. The steak was nothing special, the cheese (either whiz or real) was really nothing special. Only the bread was above average. But honestly...nothing going on here. For a real, actually delicious cheesesteak, go to your local gourmet deli or try Uncle Sam's Subs in Pittsburgh (yes, Pittsburgh!). But who comes here for the actual taste of the food? It's really for the experience. It was cold, rainy and March when I was here. The tables were wet, people were eating standing up. The people were hodge-podge of local east-coasters (totally New Jersey stereotypes) and tourists (like me or Bob and Jane from Iowa). The intersection of Passyunk and....every other street in South Philly...was jammed and busy and pointless as you've seen it on TV. Recently, Geno's has become famous for their right-wing politics more than their food. Every employee wore shirts and multiple signs read ""this is America, order in English!"" Which is both funny and somewhat hypocritical. I'd rather it said ""this is America, order in American!"". Ah well. And yes, they sold Freedom Fries, not French Fries. And there were books on display excoriating Mumia The Terrorist. And pictures with Rudy Giuliani eating there. Good times. Just accept it for what it is, be amused by it, and move on. Overall, it was an enjoyable tourist spot and must-do in Philly if only because everyone tells you it is. So go enjoy that mediocre sandwich which is part of quintessential Americana!"
8204,9,3,1,3/25/2008,"Pat's was closed. The line for Geno's was in the street! ˜We waited, mouths watering for the sandwich. ˜I feel like I'm not really qualified to judge a cheesesteak because of my lack of cheesesteak consuming experience. ˜I liked ordering though, and the guy at the counter was impressed with my, ""whiz wit,"" rather than asking a bunch of questions and holding the line up. ˜I have to say the sandwich wasn't all that flavorful, and there was minimal cheese. ˜It was okay, though and the experience was somewhat fulfilling in it's own right."
8205,9,1,1,3/22/2008,"Trekking to Philadelphia looking for a good cheesesteak? Hit up D'Alessandro's in Roxborough. If you're without an automobile and don't want to venture that far, go to Jim's on South Street. Avoid this tourist trap. (Or stop by, take photos like the tourist you are, then leave.) Their steaks are good, but not worth fighting crowds for. Geno's is one of the well-known spots in Philadelphia - find me an in-flight magazine that doesn't mention them. I've had their regular cheesesteak, without cheese, and roasted peppers (it's half decent, greasy as all get-out as they should be), and sat at on a bench outside - but ever since they posted those wonky, inflammatory ""THIS IS AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING, SPEAK ENGLISH"" signs, Geno's has been on my ""no-go"" list. The signs are a little tasteless and turn off English-speakers, regardless of origin. I'm as patriotic as the next American, but can we be more diplomatic? Maybe ""Order in English please""?"
8206,9,1,1,3/22/2008,"Hmm- I guess I haven't done a review about this place. You think with all the Neon they have that would equate to a quality cheesesteak. Apparently not. I only had a cheesesteak here way back when. The meat was tough, and the sandwich just didn't do it for me. Isn't this supposed to be one of the Top 5 Philly joints to go to for this sort of thing?? ˜And the ""Speak English"" sign drops it from 2 stars to 1"

8210,9,3,1,2/27/2008,"There are better cheesesteaks in town, and less xenophobic purveyors of them. That said, if you have visitors from out of town they will most likely want to eat one here. The cheese fries are pretty good, and the roast pork and provolone sandwiches are actually tastier than their more famous cousins (but again, there are better ones elsewhere). My ex and I used to debate whether we should eat at Pat's or Geno's when we needed a late-night grease infusion. She said Pat's because they needed our money to buy some neon.

It's loud. Really loud. The place is freaking covered in neon, is bright as all getout, and there's copious politically-charged postings in their windows. All in all it lends to a fascist vibe that you WILL buy your steak at Geno's and you WILL like it! Pat's, directly across the street, is the Chevy Nova with a fading paint job and Bondo in a dent in the door. Point being, just as both are Chevys underneath, the actual cheesesteaks aren't that much different. I used to go to each interchangeably but I've decided that I prefer Pat's. I like the steaks a little better but I also like the unpretentious, grungy vibe. To be sure, the only time I generally go is when I'm intoxicated (and this is good advice for everyone, by the way - it's a real slice of Philly after 2AM), so my judgement on the sammiches may be flawed. Neither one really makes the best Philly Cheesesteak anyway. Try Tony Lukes, Steaks On South, John's Roast Pork or (my personal fave) Abner's."
8215,9,2,1,2/14/2008,"In a head-to-head comparison in a whirlwind weekend in Philly, the bf and I had 4 cheesesteaks in 3 days (hey, we just had to). ˜We tested out Geno's Pat's, Jim's, and Tony Luke's with the traditional ""whiz with"" at each place. ˜Here's our ranking: 1. ˜Pat's (best combination of flavorful meat, tender onions, and lots of whiz) 2. Jim's (somewhat smaller sandwich, great robust flavor, very balanced) 3. Tony Luke's (while the whiz with was just okay, the steak italian with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe is freaking AWESOME!) 4. Geno's (our least favorite based on a bit tougher meat, and diluted whiz - it seemed runny)"
8216,9,2,1,2/13/2008,"I'd rate this place a 2.5. My bf brought back the Italian and the pork cheesesteak all the way back to SF for me! ˜Of course I'm rating this place a little more leniently since I didn't have the sandwiches fresh. But with that said, I thought both meats tasted a bit dry but I'm leaning toward the pork cheesesteak as being the better of the two. And like Pat's I would have liked more cheese please. ˜If I had to choose between the two, I think I'll go with Pat's since they have more cheesesteak options (prices are similar at both places...expensive!). But honestly, I wouldn't go back to either places if I were in Philly. I'd continue my search in Philly for better cheesesteaks. BTW, my bf said this place looked more classier than Pat's. Geno's definitely spent more time on decor..apparently it looked more ""fancier"" according to the bf."
8217,9,3,1,2/4/2008,"Hmmm Geno's or Pat's? Pat's or Geno's? That is the question. As a kid, my dad and I would come in to Philly to get cheesesteaks. He would go to Pat's, I would go to Geno's, or vice versa, and then we'd cut them each in half and share. They're pretty much the same, honestly. Both just okay. IMHO the best cheesesteaks in Philly are at Jim's on South Street. Blasphemous?! Or just tellin' it like it is? Sorry, yo."
8218,9,3,1,1/24/2008,"I rate this place 3.5 stars. On my last trip to Philly, my mission was to try all the philly cheesesteak places we could in 2 days. ˜We went to Pats, Genos, and Jim's. Genos was actually my favorite because I loved the way the meat was actually sliced a little thicker than Pat's and Jim's. ˜I got the sand which with onions and cheez whiz. ˜Believe me I thought cheez whiz would be disgusting but it is actually SOOOO good. I only order philly cheesesteak sandwiches with cheez whiz. ˜ My sandwich was nice, hot and delicious. ˜My only compliant was the whole ""this is America, speak English thing."" What a racist/prejudice thing to have at your restaurant. ˜Especially being in such a diverse city such as Philadelphia. ˜WTF?"
8219,9,1,1,1/22/2008,"Seriously, what is the big deal, its alright, but i think i paid 7 dollars for a freaking sandwich i could have made at home with some onions & steak-ums. The place was decorated with all these photos of famous people and the building was painted bright orange. I also dont get the whole ""speak english"" thing, those guys had an accent that was so heavy I couldnt understand what they were saying. I swear these guys could star in the Godfather or the Sapranos. ""Wit or WITOUT?"" wait that's not proper English, I dont get it. bottom line: genos isnt all that great and throwing their hat into the ring in the immigration debate is stupid, they probably have illegals working in the back for christ sakes!"
8220,9,1,1,1/21/2008,Well I couldn't review Pat's without reviewing Geno's. ˜So to sum things up in a nutshell: ˜CRAP!
8221,9,3,1,1/21/2008,"WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL???? Went to a couple of Philly natives this past weekend and asked them where I could get the best ˜Philly Cheesesteaks. ˜They told me to try either Geno's or Pat's, which they said were right across the street. ˜I opted for Geno's because like a fly attracted to neon, the bright orange sucked me in. ˜ The menu was ... non existant. ˜Basically you get cheesesteak wiith or without cheese. ˜For some excitement you can choose your cheese-american, cheese whiz, or provolone and onion/no-onion. ˜I chose the whiz with onion. ˜I figure I may as well go as authentic as possible. ˜Being a novice, I didn't realize the separate window situation. ˜I guess multi-tasking is not linked to the cheesesteak making gene. ˜One window takes only the cheesesteak order (mulitple cheese options is too much to handle) and the other takes the fries/cheesefries and soda order. ˜I also had the cheese fries to make my cholesterol-fest complete. ˜ With all that, the cheesesteak was only okay. ˜The buns were nice and soft. ˜The onions were tasty and the steak was nice and tender. ˜Cheese whiz is cheese whiz. ˜You could put it on an old sneaker and it would taste good. ˜I guess I was expecting something spectacular but all I got was what I've had elsewhere - tasty but nothing special."
8222,9,4,1,1/4/2008,"Easily this was one of the best stops on our East Coast baseball Road trip of 2007. ˜Nothing like it, right after a Phillies game - seeing many comrades from Boston in the line (let's all wear our Red Sox shirts!). I was a little put off by all the anti-immigrant jabber plaguing the establishment... but there's nothing I can do about it. ˜My beau felt nostalgic like he was in a Boyz II Men video here. ˜And it was lit up like Jesus at Christmas. ˜So we'll call it even. The food was great, my only regret was not getting more of it, and waiting until our second Philadelphia vacation to do Cheesesteaks in South Philly. Will go to Geno's again, and also Pat's for comparison next visit to Philly."
8223,9,3,1,1/3/2008,"Place is aiiiight. I think Geno's (and Pat's across the street) just got lucky with that weird phenomenon of how an establishment can become an icon / tourist attraction despite it's run-of-the-mill food item. They don't even have to really try anymore because their reputation is already entrenched in the minds of the public, especially the out of towners which come just to say they at here. (Like me.) I sampled 4 cheesesteaks in the 3 days I was in Philly, and Geno's was the worst. I would say, if you're visiting, definitely check it out just because of the so-called history and rivalry between Geno's & Pat's. But if I actually lived in Philly, I probably wouldn't be going here often. I would suggest trying cheesesteaks from both establishments to compare. Geno''s is really anal about you enjoying any non-Geno's sandwich in their vicinity. So what you should do is split a cheesteak here with a friend. Then cross the street, and split a cheesteak at Pat's. If you're by yourself and had to pick one of the two, I would have to go with Pat's instead. See my Pat's review for why."
8224,9,4,1,1/2/2008,"So here's the deal, my wife and I wanted to try the famous cheesesteak debate and try both Geno's and Pat's. My wife was worried that one or the other would get mad at us for eating at one establishment then crossing the street to try the other, I was like...are you kidding me, do you know how many tourists are about to do what we're about to do, so off we went. I did the ordering at Geno's and stumbled on the ordering process, I said something like one regular cheesesteak please, when I should have said one wiz wit, the guy at the counter definitely knew i was a tourist by then, and spoke down to me as such. The steak came out seasoned perfectly with just the right amount of oozing cheese and the roll was nice and soft absorbing all the juices. The only thing keeping it from 5 stars besides the attitude was the decor of the whole place, I felt like I was in a game show, all glitzy and glamorous. Just look at the night pics and you'll see what I mean. continue onto my Pat's review."
8225,9,1,1,12/28/2007,"Although it's been a good couple of years since I've eaten a cheesesteak I figured I know enough about these places to get some good facts across. so here goes: 1) Unless a long and obnoxious line takes you to a roller coaster, the concert of a lifetime, or a truly epic event, it probably isn't going to be worth waiting in. So if you see a long line for a sandwich don't bother, ESPECIALLY if you're waiting for this pile of junk. 2) Most real Philadelphians find wiz to be quite disgusting. Hell it's probably toxic in nature. Fortunately though if it's a legit cheesesteak establishment you should be able to order yours ""wit"" American or provolone cheese. 3) Contrary to popular cheesesteak ordering belief, ""wit wiz"" actually isn't English. So will you please stop being an ass clown Joey Vento? 4) Fact of the matter is that unless we're drunk enough to the point that we end up regretting our food choices the next morning, most real Philadelphians don't bother with Geno's or Pat's. Go to Tony Lukes, Steaks On South, John's Roast Pork, hell ANY other sandwich shop here that serves a cheesesteak, and you're bound to find something a lot better. And you might not even have to bother with a line or a server with bad attitude while you do so. so do yourself a favor and don't believe the hype that comes with this place."
8226,9,1,1,12/28/2007,"Geno's is even worse than Pat's, and I think they're both pretty crappy. But, Geno's slices their steak all weird and it's just not right. The only reason to come down here is late at night if you're looking for a good side show. But, once you've seen it once, there's no reason to go back. Especially not for the cheesesteaks."
8227,9,4,1,12/27/2007,"The question between South Philly always comes down to Geno's and Pat's. ˜It's like Giordano's versus Lou Malnati's for Chicago-style pizza -- both might be great, but you have to pick a favorite. For me, I'm going with Geno's because they focus more on the meat rather than the Cheese Whiz. ˜I'm also going to say the use of the whiz for philly cheese steaks has got to be the most overrated culinary concept of all time (dodges lightning bolt). ˜ I think the attitude at Geno's and Pat's further accentuates life in South Philly. ˜It's not only about the sandwiches, but there is also a distinct Philly flair to the service which makes this place great. And now time for my little moment on the soapbox. ˜If a restaurant requests their patrons to speak English to them, that is their right. ˜After all, freedom of speech includes the right to state beliefs or ideas that might be construed as offensive (by the way, English is not my first language). ˜So, basically, if you are going to interpet a sign in the most offensive manner to you, then that's your business (and you probably won't like this place). ˜However, my review is based on the actual sandwich and it's stellar."
8228,9,2,1,11/28/2007,"Geno's is inferior to Pat's for two reasons. ˜The first is their meat, which appears to be tougher and gristle-ier than Pat's. ˜The second is their uber-tacky sign, which makes that corner look like Reno, which isn't a good thing."
8229,9,3,1,11/18/2007,"Pat's is better than Geno's. last two times i was in Philly, i got one from each, sat down, took a bite from Pat's, and then a bite from Geno's. I think the onions and bread from Pat's put them over the top. my favorite from Pat's is cheese steak wit onions, wiz and provolone. yeah I'm going to die soon. but it's so effing good! way better than Jim's, and way better than the other random spots i sadly stopped at in Philly. Geno's outward appearance is a sign of their food. well not really, but i don't like their glitzy neon covered building. and the rolls are too crunchy, too much bread covering the meatie cheesie goodness that's hidden inside. I've never had service problems from either. both have signs telling you how to order. read those and follow through and you'll be ok with getting your foods. but don't get me wrong, Geno's is great too, just not as good as Pats in my own opinion."
8230,9,4,1,11/12/2007,"There are a few standard Cheesesteak places in and around Philadelphia--Geno's, Pat's, Steve's, Jim's, and Tony Luke's. I'm going to start off by saying that they are all somewhat similar to each other in general, but each of them has their own slight unique taste. The one thing I can say about Geno's that impressed me is the cleanliness of the inside. I once took a tour of the inside of the kitchen and the freezers where they store the meat across the street, and I've never seen anything as clean as those two places. Everything was SUPER clean and looked as if it was brand new. When I think of fast ˜food, I don't necessarily equate clean with the state of the kitchens. Geno's however, is another story--in a good way. I'd eat here simply because I have peace of mind that Geno's takes pride in keeping the place clean while still serving tons of customers everyday."
8231,9,5,1,11/4/2007,"Sure, eating Geno's in front of Geno's is one thing. ˜But wrapping a dozen in tinfoil and flying back to DC on 95 going, well, 95 is a guaranteed way to make some good friends into better friends. (or to win over your friend's girlfriend's Dad who grew up in South Philly) Good thing I didn't get pulled over. ˜Apparently, packages of three cheese-steaks in tinfoil on your back seat look surprisingly like a key of either heroin or cocaine. ˜and you know those drug dogs would have lost their minds over the extra wiz w/ onions. (I should have brought back two dozen...so many regrets...)"
8232,9,5,1,9/18/2007,"Geno's - Pat's what's the difference. I grew up on this slop and it still tastes the same, regardless of what cheesewiz they use :)"
8233,9,3,1,9/10/2007,"For the first time, I went to South Philly to conduct ""The Ultimate Philly Cheese Steak Challenge"" with my boyfriend and my sister. The first thing I thought of when I went to Geno's was that it was a lot cleaner, brighter, and newer looking than Pat's. ˜Quite honestly, Pat's just looked like a run-down, traditional cheese steak stand. When I went to Geno's the line was not long at all. ˜I really appreciated how they don't have the ordering system like Pat's. ˜We bought cheese steak - with Whiz and onions - and fries. ˜I absolutely hated the fries. ˜Maybe it was their own discrete way of saying, ""Get cheese fries,"" but the regular fries were tasteless. ˜It tasted like fries that had been stored in a closet full of mothballs. ˜Yuck. ˜Nonetheless, the cheese steak was fine. ˜The steak was juicier, which meets my definition of a good steak. ˜I also tasted a lot more onion in my sandwich. So all in all, three stars for having a better sandwich, or their specialty, but having a horrible side dish - such as fries! :("
8234,9,3,1,9/2/2007,"I like beef as much as the next girl, but this? A little too beefy for me. The steak wasn't cut nice and thin, and was not as moist as the restaurant-that-shall-not-be-named across the street (which I gave a five star review to). Hubby and I split at the intersection. He went to Geno's, and I went to the polar opposite (read: yummy) of Geno's across the street. We each ordered a sandwich, then met at a completely unbiased corner to split the sandwiches and compare the two cheese steak giants. Ahem. Bread: A little tough and honestly hard to chew. I'm not 75 with dentures. I'm 29, have healthy gums, and like a little toughness. This was too much. Meat: A little too thick, a little to consistent with color, making me feel that this was highly processed. Cheese: A little too unmelty. That's the cardinal rule for making a cheese steak sandwich. You HAVE TO MELT THE CHEESE. Duh. Everyone knows that. So, I can safely say the other place has my vote. Even though the patrons of Geno's are stupid enough to file the line of people out through the middle of the intersection, we'll go over to Pat's, where the patrons line the sidewalk safely. Maybe that should be a sign...."
8235,9,2,1,8/30/2007,Had my first Geno's steak today. I gave it a 2 due to the onions being really good. The onions were the only thing redeeming about the experience. Everyone commented already on the neon lights and the xenophobia so I'll just focus on my cheesesteak. My first impression was that the sandwich was really small. Maybe I was just extra hungry. My second impression was that the meat was terrible. It was like one of those frozen steak-ums. A distinct lack of flavor left me underwhelmed. No need for a third impression...
8236,9,5,1,8/22/2007,"If you have a cheesesteak at lunch, you won't need to have dinner."
8237,9,4,1,8/13/2007,"While visiting Philly for the first time this weekend, I had to get a Cheese steak. We trusty tour guide took me to the ""best,"" which he referred to Geno's. It's a comic little stand and you order your steak at the counter. At one window, I ordered the steak with provolone and at another window I ordered the fries and drinks. The cheese steak came out instantly. The bread was warm and filled with thin slices of beef, diced sauteed onions and melted provolone cheese. It was yummy in a gross, fatty kinda way. Fries were good too."
8238,9,5,1,7/23/2007,"When you think of Cheese Steak think of Geno's Steaks in Philadelphia . I would come in on the 2 o'clock train just to have a sandwich here before my girlfriend got out of class at Penn. Later that evening while she was asleep I would go and get another sandwich. Cheese Steaks are better than cuddling. Do not order fries with it, this is not a hamburger. Think of it as an Italian American gift to the world similar to the Burrito in California."
8239,9,3,1,7/21/2007,I visited Philly just to get a taste of authentic cheese steak. Can we say overrated?
8240,9,3,1,7/19/2007,"Totally suck up my political beliefs when ordering at Geno's. Joe V is just whacked. no other word for it... but on the flip side, love his sandwiches and fries! lesson one. when you say: ""provolone with"" that = 's a cheese steak with provolone AND onions. when you go to geno's or pats... please please please don't say... ""i would like to order a cheesesteak with american cheese and onions..."" have fun. sound like a native. ""AMERICAN WITH!"" (and step aside)...ala the soupnazi :) on cold nights... park on the street and eat in your car. ˜the benches are very very cold. and in a drunken stupor ... don't argue politics with the very large man at the geno's counter..remember... they are making your food right?!! :-)"
8241,9,2,1,7/18/2007,"I have to say Pat's is the winner of this one. ˜The only thing that is worst at Pat's... the view of the Neon Lights at Genos! I gave this place a legitimate shot, but I was not a fan. ˜Sorry... I would rather stand in line at Pat's."
8242,9,5,1,7/18/2007,"Great cheese steaks! ˜Located in a sketchy portion of Philly, not too far from downtown or I 95, Geno's has a great cheese steak with cheese wiz. ˜You do need to park on the street and spots are limited. ˜They are open 24-7 so if you are dying for a cheese steak at 7AM, knock yourself out! ˜This is definately a great place to check out if you are trying to get a taste for Philadelphia."
8243,9,2,1,7/17/2007,"Geno's is okay, but the ordering system is lame (separate lines for separate items). ˜The staff is extremely hostile and unfriendly in a seemingly intentional way. ˜It is a stupid business model to have, when any given day probably 10-15% of their customers are first timers. ˜Plus, they have the worst selection of ""celebrity pictures"" adorning the walls outside. ˜You think I am impressed because Shavlik Randolph ate here once and signed a picture to document this? ˜Exactly. Anyway, I have had better cheesesteaks elsewhere. ˜The bread was kind of hard. ˜Though it was flavorful, the portion of meat seemed to be a little on the smaller side. ˜The cheese is pretty good. ˜Obviously, since the whole cheesesteak cannot be greater than the sum of its parts, it merely struck me as normal. ˜Nothing worth raving about. ˜The fries were a little better, though."
8244,9,1,1,7/17/2007,"I must say, I was disappointed with my first ever cheesesteak! It was a coin flip between Geno's and Pat's, and the line at Geno's was longer (I know, sounds strange, but I figured if there are more people in line, it's better?). I've been told that it's standard cheesesteak protocol to be rushed through the line at lightning speed, but as a first-timer, I didn't know how to order and was yelled at! English-only sticker aside, I definitely don't speak Cheesesteak. I'm not sure what I was expecting exactly, but I figured that the poor customer service would be balanced out by a seriously phenomenal sandwich. It wasn't. Le sadness."
8245,9,1,1,7/10/2007,"the overly ostentatious decor of this place coupled with the fact that only english speakers can eat there, dissuaded me from even giving this infamous place a try. i know i shouldn't really make a review off of that, but seriously, a place that is racist enough to actually say ""THIS IS AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING, SPEAK ENGLISH."" deserves to be called out on that. its's just completely insane."
8246,9,1,1,7/7/2007,"It's cliche to say ""I'm from Philly; Geno's sucks"" but I have to say ""Geno Sucks"". No matter what time of day I go with tourist friends and carpetbaggers on their first trips, the food is cold and congealed. ˜It's a horrible example of a first cheesesteak. ˜ Pat's is better, but I don't like getting into the cheese steak debates. ˜I only mention Pat's because it's across the street. ˜ ˜ The anti-Mumia posters and pictures of celebrities as well as the aforementioned anti-immigrant signs makes for true hilarity when ordering a drunken cheesesteak at 3am."
8247,9,3,1,7/1/2007,"I can't believe no one pointed this out yet: the meat at Geno's is not cooked on the griddle. ˜It comes to the griddle already cooked in these little metal boxes. ˜I think they steam it in the back, then throw it on the griddle to add some grease. ˜Truly the McDonald's of cheesesteaks. I live around the corner, and I will tell you that Pat's is MUCH better. EDIT: I went to Geno's at 4am one morning, when Pat's was temporarily closed, and had an opposite experience. ˜The meat was cooked fresh to order and the sandwich was quite good. ˜I'm bumping them up to 3 stars, but be wary when the line is long."
8248,9,1,1,6/30/2007,I'd eat at Geno's but I don't know how to speak english.
8249,9,4,1,6/26/2007,"Welcome to the world of Philly cheese steaks, where battles over which place has the best steak get really ugly. ˜Many people will tell you to go to Pat's (the only other real South Philly steak joint, but it has gone way downhill over the years), Jim's, Steve's, or Tony Luke's (which does have darn good rolls). ˜However, I have to recommend Geno's. ˜My father grew up in South Philly and used to work for Marinelli's Italian bakery, where they used to make cheese steak rolls by hand, and I also grew up in the city, so I was raised as a Geno's partisan from the time I was old enough to eat a steak. Geno's has got great steaks and, if you want something different, roast pork sandwiches. ˜The cheese steaks, however, are what people come from miles around to eat. ˜So just look for the store that is so brightly lit that you can see it from space, and you've come to the right place. ˜Know what you want before you get to the order window because the line is long and the people behind the window don't want anyone holding up the line. ˜Also, please don't talk on your cell phone while you're in line. If you are not paying attention when you get to the order window, you'll be told to go to the back of the line because you were being rude. ˜So there's an element of the soup Nazi in this place, but I think that's part of its charm. The correct way to order is to say the type of cheese you want and whether you want onions, so it'd be something like, ""American wit"" or ""Provolone wit-out"" (no ""th"" sound for the end of ""with"" if you want to sound like a local). ˜""Wit,"" of course, is with onions, and ""wit-out"" means no onions. ˜Now, many people, especially 20-something guys, will tell you to get a steak with cheese wiz. ˜However, no self-respecting Philadelphian who really knows cheese steaks will order cheese wiz on his/her steak. ˜Cheese wiz was not invented yet when Philly steaks were first sold, so it's not ""authentic."" ˜American and Provolone are the acceptable cheeses to order. ˜I prefer Provolone because it melts better. ˜ This suggestion is sure to cause controversy among the wiz devotees, but I actually had a conversation with the guy behind the counter at Geno's one day, on a rare day when there was no one else in line, and he told me that they can always tell tourists and guys from the suburbs because they are the ones who order cheese wiz. ˜So if you really want an ""authentic"" cheese steak, take this local gal's advice and get real cheese on it. Now, you order your steaks at one window and then get your drinks and/or fries at the other window. ˜That's the system. ˜When you order your steak, ask for papers so you can get cherry peppers out of the pot on the condiment stand. ˜If you've never had a cherry pepper, it's a small pepper that is tangy and a bit sweet. ˜It adds just the right amount of flavor to your sandwich (and don't be fooled by ""Philadelphia style"" steaks you see in other cities that have bell peppers on the sandwiches - that's not how we do it in Philly). ˜They have red and green cherry peppers, but I always look for the reddest ones in the pot to put on my sandwich. I usually eat in my car if it's cold (and good luck finding a parking spot), but they also have tables if you want to eat there. Finally, the reason I'm giving Geno's 4 stars instead of 5 has nothing to do with the quality of their food and everything to do with the confrontational signs that they have posted all around the business - xenophobic signs that specify that customers can only order in English and that they sell ""freedom fries"" instead of French fries. ˜If I wasn't raised on Geno's steaks, and if I could only find a better tasting steak in the city, I'd take my liberal butt elsewhere. ˜Alas, though, I can't find a more satisfying steak in the city, and I do appreciate Geno's support of the Philly P.D., so I keep going back there, usually at 3 a.m. after the bars have let out, to indulge my cravings for mouth-watering, thinly-sliced steak on a soft roll with melted provolone and cherry peppers, birch beer, and, of course, cheese fries (if I'm going to eat more than my daily recommended fat intake in one meal, why not go all the way, right?). I understand people have their own preferences for cheese steaks, but you've gotta try both Geno's and Pat's before you make up your mind."
8250,9,3,1,6/25/2007,"Decent steak, but I'm a fan of Pat's more I think. ˜Pat has softer bread and chopped up steak. ˜Geno's large pieces of steak are nice, but they don't taste as tender as the chopped up steak at Pat's and seem less flavorful. ˜Go for the whiz wit at Pat's and try Geno's another time. Also, if you're easily offended by closed-mindedness, you may not like the ""pro-American"" signs at Geno's."
8251,9,2,1,6/19/2007,"It wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but it was certainly tasty. We got one cheesesteak from Pat's and one from Geno's and to tell you the truth, they were pretty much the same. Should I find myself in Philly again and get a hankering for a greasy meat sandwich, I'd pick Pat's. The overbearing ""America is for English speakers RAH RAH RAH!"" crap at Geno's is pretty insulting."
8252,9,3,1,6/10/2007,"The way Geno's prepares there sandwich is not for me. The meat is in slices, as opposed to chopped. But what I will say is that the place is clean! The cleanliness is stellar, which really makes you feel a bit better about the product you know is already bad for you."
8253,9,1,1,5/28/2007,"The cheese whiz variety was better than the provolone and the condiments station was very nice. However, I prefer my steaks without evil politics; lay off the anti-Spanish-speaking, anti-Mumia garbage, and let me eat my cheesesteak in peace, you PSYCHOS."
8254,9,4,1,5/24/2007,"I loved my Geno's experience so much that I have a picture of my boyfriend and I outside of ithe glorious bright shack on my cell phone that I look at everyday! ˜ I loved how they were so thin, easy to eat, and not particularly as messy as you ˜may expect. ˜I love mine with whiz and onions... and some ketchup! The people working there have no patience for people who don't know what they want or don't know how ˜to order ˜(1 whiz with!) so be ready!!!! ˜The line always seemed to wrap around the building but movied really quick. I haven't tried Pat's so I can not compare it as most do to them... perhaps I will need to try it on my next trip to Philly so I can."
8255,9,1,1,4/25/2007,"Here's my take by way of the hot-button issues that are often brought to bear when discussing Genos. ˜First, the language issue. ˜I'm old enough to remember walking into many a Philadelphia corner pizza places as a kid in the 80s and hearing Italian spoken by just about everyone. Vento's grandparents no doubt did the same, at least for a while. ˜I've also had the fortune of working in the language business and living in Southern California for quite a while. ˜I've never met a second generation American of a Spanish-speaking background that does not speak English. It's the way things work, no immigrant group has come to the US with a widespread command of the English language. ˜I've seen no proof to demonstrate that today's Latino immigrants are learning English any slower than yesterday's Italian immigrants. The posturing by Geno's is bigoted towards those people they aren't especially fond of. ˜They aren't worthy of my business any longer. Second would be their status as an ""infamous"" cheesesteak spot. ˜Geno's had very little fame before the Food Network existed and if you judge by the many disappointed reviews out out-of-towners, it's been a disgrace to this fine sandwich. While they use good non-processed meat (though the pressed stuff has its place!), they take the same sort of express approach you see at Pats where your order is ready before you're done speaking- cheese still cold and stiff. ˜Add to that a considerable dose of canned rudeness and you'll be looking for a Plan B for lunch. ˜The only thing going for this place is bright lights and long hours. ˜You will do better going into virtually any corner pizza/steak place with a 1970s pepsi sign hanging over the door."
8256,9,3,1,4/24/2007,"For the only cheesesteak I've ever had in Philly, it wasn't bad. But it wasn't the best either. I guess I prefer my steak thinly sliced and chopped rather than served in thicker slices like Geno's. I had a Whiz-Wit (cheeseteak with cheez whiz and onions) and it was tasty, but definitely greasy. The grease and juices were dripping down from the bottom after taking just two bites. I never got to decide if Geno's or Pat's was better since it was Easter Sunday and Pat's was closed. =P I won't be racing back anytime soon. Bottom Line: Tourist Trap"
8257,9,3,1,4/11/2007,"I wreaked havoc on my digestive system by eating both Pat's and Geno's within the hour so I could do a side-by-side comparison. Result? ˜INCONCLUSIVE. Pat's - Pros: - Lots & lots of cheese whiz. - Thick(er), delicious pizza fries. - Better, softer, hoagie. - Cheesesteak add-ons such as mushrooms, peppers, and pizza sauce. Pat's - Cons: - Dirtier. ˜No pretty tables or clean condiment bar. - Ruder service. ˜If you don't get the ordering system right, you got to move to the back of the line. Geno's - Pros: - Thicker slices of meat. - Stronger onion flavour. - Clean restaurant decorated in bright orange colours. - Neon-lit environment. ˜Like the Boardwalk! - Nice service. ˜They actually wrap and bag your sandwich. ˜At Pat's, they throw it at you on a piece of wax paper. Geno's - Cons: - Not as much cheese. ˜Less cheese, less fun! - Thin, McDonald-esqe fries. ˜Again, less cheese. - Lack of cheesesteak toppings - no mushrooms, peppers, pizza sauce, or anything else. Overall: Better Food: Pat's! Better Experience: Geno's! Other tips: - Only outdoor seating at both places, so be prepared to sacrifice the tips of your fingers to frostbite during the colder months. ˜Or, alternatively, order to go. - Learn how to order. ˜First, specify what cheese (cheese whiz - the classic!, American, or provolone) you want. ˜Second, specify whether or not you want onions. For example, ""whiz with"" translates into ""cheesesteak with cheese whiz with onions"". ˜At Pat's, tack on the toppings you want following your order. - Geno's & Pat's are probably tourist traps. ˜I definitely believe that there are better places in the city to get your cholesterol fix, but you got to try the classics at least once!"
8258,9,3,1,3/15/2007,"Geno's has been in the news, b/c the guy who runs it is a racist. And if that's not enough to keep you away, consider this: the quality of his steaks has been going south for years. So, really, just don't give him your business. You'll get a better steak at Jim's or Pat's or, if you really want to indulge, Tony Luke's."
8259,9,4,1,3/1/2007,"So now I'm back in Taipei. ˜Right down the street from me there's a small, privately owned breakfast shop run by the son of some Hakka immigrants from China. ˜Besides stuff like egg-pancakes and soy milk, this little shop is most famous ˜for their version of a common breakfast item known as a ˜fried-dough cruller wrapped in a griled pancake (shao bing you tiao;). ˜In fact, they are so well known for this specialty, people line up out the door for up to ten minutes in the morning to buy them. So one day, I decided try this little place myself and see ˜what the hype was all about. ˜ I got their around 9 in the morning and placed myself at the end of the long line that was now spilling into the street. ˜ 5 minutes later, I arrived at the front of the line and proceeded to bark my order to the shop owner, now furiously manning the griddle. ˜ ""I'd like a fried dough cruller wrapped in a griddle pancake please!"" ""nin yiao she me?"" ""Ummm, fried dough umm, wrapped, um in panc.... ""she me?!?"" And with that highly eloquent retort, ˜he simply skipped over me and proceeded to take the order from the eager customer waiting in line right behind me, cash in hand. Relegated to the end of the line and visibly embarrassed, I was nonetheless even more determined to do it right this time. ˜Upon reaching the same owner, who was still preoccupied with the same griddle, but who was now flipping fragrant sesame buns through the air, I managed to whimper a barely decipherable, ""yi ge shao bing you tiao"". ˜ ""shao bin you tiao!;!"" the manager brusquely shouted to his daughter who was handling the money at the counter behind him. It was then, while taking that first bite into that steaming, crunchy, pile of oily goodness, that I had an epiphany. ˜ Even though the owner of that breakfast shop is still clearly some sort of bigoted racist for not taking my order in English, I really do get my food faster by ordering in Chinese."
8260,9,2,1,2/27/2007,"Geno's is so gaudy it makes me sick. ˜The neon lights do not belong in South Philly...or maybe even the east coast in general. ˜Geno's is a little cleaner, in both sandwich and establishment, but like Caitlin said, a Philly cheesesteak shop should be unassuming...like Pat's. I do not care how long the line is at Pat's, I will never cross the street and enter the ""Passyunk Strip."""
8261,9,2,1,2/26/2007,"Boo. Try Pat's or Tony Luke's first. There is something about Geno's that doesn't sit well. First off, their establishment looks like it belongs in Vegas with it's bright lights and flashy signs. A real Philly cheesesteak joint should look shady and unassuming. ˜Also, no one can look good under those orange lights. The actual taste of the steak is alright, and I bet wonderful if you've never had it, but the onions aren't as sauteed and the meat not as juicy as at Pat's."
8262,9,2,1,2/25/2007,"Out of towners love that ""Which is better: Pat's or Geno's?"" question. Generally, I say neither. The way I do describe Geno's is that they are Las Vegas, whereas Pat's is Reno. Geno's has all the lights, bells, whistles. Pat's has a ""trapped in 1965"" feel. That being said, I've always preferred Pat's. Secondly, they stay out of bad press just a notch above Geno's bigotry. I don't think I've gone to either since I was 19. The lines are terrible, as are many of the people in them (smells, language, aesthetics). I recognize this as a part of Philly eating history, but I think service has evolved, and Geno's awareness and service needs to. After all, we wouldn't still sit at segregated lunch counters in the south 'cause they had good slices of pie, would we? I also hate the way both of these places warrant Woodstock '99 prices for mass produced crap, just 'cause they have a reputation. There's no reason why it should cost $13 to eat what would cost you $7 anywhere else."
8263,9,1,1,2/15/2007,"I've met people who make intelligent, even convincing arguments against immigration. (I usually don't agree with them, but I can respect some of their points.) The owner of Geno's Steaks is not one of them. The man is clearly intimidated by the throngs of excellent Mexican and Vietnamese restaurants that have otherwise been warmly welcomed into the ""Italian Market"" section of the city. Here's the evidence against him: a) The famous sticker on the window: THIS IS AMERICA: WHEN ORDERING, SPEAK ENGLISH. b) The t-shirt displayed in a window across the street: ""I'M AN AMERICAN SO I ORDER IN ENGLISH."" Geno's owner Joseph Vento is the grandson of immigrants from Sicily, who faced their own struggles with the English language when they landed in America in the 1920s. Of course, Geno himself is too far removed from that struggle -- he, after all, is a REAL American -- to know how difficult it is for many people, especially adults, to learn a second-language."
8264,9,2,1,1/24/2007,"So Joey Vento is a real jackass, but I could care less, ˜his steaks suck either way, just like Pat's. ˜If you're a tourist and it's the only one you've ever had then I'm sure they're great, but any pizzareia in Philly will make you a way better steak without a huge line or list of ordering procedures. ˜If you're drunk and it's real late then go ahead, you're not going anywhere else, but, if you can, go somewhere else, like Jim's."
8265,9,4,1,1/16/2007,Wonderful cheesesteaks . . . second ONLY to the place across the street (I'll refrain from naming it.) ˜The only difference in my opinion between the two places is the meat . . . one chops it while the other uses the whole slice on the sandwich. ˜Either way . . .

8268,9,1,1,10/8/2006,"Didn't get to try out Pat's because it was closed but the cheesesteak here wasn't that great. We also tried out Jim's right before so comparably speaking, Geno's was below average."
8269,9,1,1,9/21/2006,"EH. Everything was ""almost there"". Geno's is better with provolone cheese. So you can pretend you are in a local 'cheesy' (unlike the cheese steaks) deli and not at a place where they are supposed to dare compete with Pat's King Of Steaks. Don't you get that hot sauce from the pumps either. It's deadly! It ruins the whole thing. The seatings are comfortable because it's spaced out well around a nice ghetto corner facing (yay) Pat's. Neon lights and framed pictures with the whole world. Maybe that's what did it. Oh no wait, maybe it was that crazy gut aura I got from those signs that read something in the likes of ""SPEAK ENGLISH! THIS IS AMERICA!"" Okay a beloved police officer died because of a foreigner and you own some harley's across the street. Doesn;t matter to me. Get some class and better food. (Too bad because the service on the line was pretty great. HAHA the irony!)"
8270,9,2,1,9/2/2006,"I was in Philly on vacation and I was incredibly excited to eat my first real Philly Cheesesteak at the famous Geno's. ˜I must say that I was disappointed. ˜I was expecting a greasy cheez-whiz covered artery clogger (all meant to be good adjectives I assure you), but it was just too greasy, not enough cheese, and the meat was too gristly. ˜I guess I should have gotten provolone, but I wanted the ""true"" experience. ˜I wouldn't have skipped it-- it is the Philly experience-- but I don't think I'd go back."
8271,9,4,1,8/25/2006,"HA! how could i forget to write about this place! i got my bags at the airport and headed straight for GENO'S! who cares that it was only 10 something in the mornin' i was having me a philly cheesesteak and who better to trust to make the best than Geno's. then i get there and i recall this is the same guy who began the whole, ""live in America, order in English"" deal. HAHA! i love it! i agree! i moved here from India and i was expected to speak, order, deal in English. i cant understand why other countries get by without having the same pressure. anywho, the steaks were RAGIN' and i mean ragin' cause we put Hot sauce. not me so much this time, but my friend. she had to put their ""FREEDOM FRIES"" inside the sandwich to calm down the spicy sauce. they even had jalapenos in a can as a garnish. whole jalapenos. great environment to just sit, chill, enjoy a classic philly treat. and dont forget, you order things differently here: wiz with means you are getting american cheese and onions. wiz without means no onions. make sure you know how to order or they will know that you are a tourist and you are a first timer all in one. hehe.

8279,9,1,1,4/9/2006,"there are literally thousands upon thousands of reasons why Pat's is a superior steak establishment to Geno's, which are in no way limited to the superiority of the steaks themselves. ˜yes, you will always eat a better cheesesteak at Pat's... but let us examine some of the non-culinary reasons why Geno's does not deserve your business or mine: 1. ˜the facade -- let's be honest. ˜Geno's is an aesthetic embarassment. ˜while Pat's scores points with an understated and humble exterior, Geno's has always tried to compensate for their inferior product by dressing the whole place up in a vomit-inducing sea of neon lights. ˜take a note, Geno: ˜the lights only illuminate your desperation. 2. ˜the menu -- Geno's is the only place I have ever heard of (outside of the cafeteria in our fair halls of congress, that is) ˜that ever replaced their ""french fries"" with ""freedom fries"". ˜that's right. ˜they call them freedom fries. ˜ yeeee-ikes. 3. ˜the xenophobia -- Notoriously opposed to the post-italian immigrants in south philly, and probably pissed at the five or six french tourists who visit philadelphia a year, the window at Geno's features a delightful little sign which states ""this is AMERICA please speak ENGLISH when ordering"" followed by a sign stating ""Management Reserves the Right to Refuse Service"". ˜and if you think the message in sign 1 has never intersected with the policy in sign 2, think again. ˜what a fine ambassador to our city you are, Genie-boy! 4. ˜the plaque -- underneath the window is a plaque hung in honor of fallen police officer Daniel Faulkner. ˜for non-delphians, this name might not mean much, but he is the victim in our city's highest-profile and most hot-button murder case. ˜(i won't go into the details, but if you want to know more about what this is all about, you'll find plenty of info when you google ""Mumia"".) ˜my issue is not that they honor the memory of this police officer, which i think is perfectly appropriate if done respectfully. ˜what seems kind of messed up is the fact that the plaque gives equal time to the officer's accused murderer: ˜ ˜it just seems really inappropriate, and i can't imagine it would make any friends or family of officer faulkner feel very good if they have to be reminded of the murderer's name every time they see the plaque. i don't mean to focus too heavily on this cheesesteakery's politics, but ˜in being so flagrant about it they clearly invite the scrutiny. the bottom line is this: ˜Pat's is just a better steak, and if it's too hard for you to make up your mind based on the variables of taste, texture, size, and service... there are plenty of other factors you can use to justify your decision. ˜Perhaps the sign on Pat's window says it best --- ""Don't eat a Mis-steak"""
8280,9,4,1,2/19/2006,"Geno's has two windows serving all Geno's menu items at rapid speed, which is more efficient than the Pat's serving model. Geno's also just seems cleaner overall than Pat's and less of a big mess of cheese goo and meat. The cheesesteak at Geno's has thinly sliced beef full of flavor and topped with sweet, cooked onions, and whiz dripped all over the sandwich. The meat and onions were more flavorful than Pat's, but the cheese was thinner and less whiz cheesy. The cheesteak at Geno's was very flavorful, with onions and seasoned beef that overtook the whiz a littlet. Those who enjoy the steak part of the sandwich will probably prefer Geno's to Pat's. Since I am equal parts a meat and a cheese fan, I would probably opt for Geno's and ask for extra cheese - in fact, I think Geno's might actually be better with provalone or some other white cheese since their whiz is slightly less ""whizzy."""

My companion and I decided that we would order our sandwich ""with whiz,"" which in Philly steak parlance means ""Give me a steak sandwich with onions and Cheese Whiz."" Other options are available, and some folks swear by American or Provolone cheese, but the legendary cheesesteak of my dreams, the cheesesteak of arcane power, the cheesesteak vilified by dead child molester and frugal gourmet Jeff Smith, the cheesesteak I've spied numerous times dancing across my always-tuned-to-the-Food Network television screen, has the bright yellow goo, the almost-dairy product that Kraft Corporation christened Cheese Whiz. I don't even like Cheese Whiz. Well, it was pretty damn good. ˜Tidy, not the sloppy monster of a sandwich that Pat's King of Steaks offers, but good, nonetheless.

It was like I was eating a desert the whole time! The pad Thai wasn't cooked all the way. It was like eating hard noodles. The crispy spring roll was cheating. I thought it had meat in it and it didn't. It had an old taste to it! ˜Did they make this a month ago? The servers didn't look happy. It looked like they were being watched. They are not interacting with the coustomers freely. In addition, the place is way to small to have that many people. In conclusion, the boss or what ever you want to call him ""claims"" that the food he makes is an original from Thailand. But its not, ive been there and the food at jasmine rice taste americanized."
8292,3889,1,0,1/28/2012,"Poor experience last night. We had a reservation. They were about half full ˜but ˜were seated in the worst table in the house right next to the kitchen separated by a flimsy curtain. We watched as many new arrivals with no reservation were seated in the better locations. My food was very poor. ˜The duck leg was served with the thigh sliced right through the bone. ˜It consisted of 10% meat and 90% was fat and bone. The meatless drumstick bone was hidden on the plate under a bed of raw shredded carrots. Who places a bone on a plate and where was the meat that had been removed from the bone? The fried rice appeared old, reheated and was tasteless served with about a tablespoon of soy sauce. My companion's entree included calamari that was so tough and rubbery it was inedible. My complaint to the manager brought a ""sorry"" . ˜At least a comp for coffee would have been appropriate. ˜We will not return. The one star is for pleasant and timely service."
8293,3889,4,0,7/26/2013,"I ate here just the other night with two friends and had a great experience! Our food was wonderful and the service was great too! Between the three of us we had the Pad Saw Ew, Red Curry and Salmon and all were delicious! I would definitely come back!"
8294,3889,4,0,7/4/2012,"I ate here a while back, but the staff didn't converse with me much; however, recently I stopped by again and there was a few new staff and the guy conversed with me and we shared a few laughs. It made my experience much better and his word choices to see how my dining in experience where terrific. He said "" Was your meal delightful"" and ""was everything lovely?"" That guy provided excellent customer service and knows how to treat customer and make them feel satisfied. Not to mention, I left a $15 tip for him. =) Keep it up Jasmine Rice will be back soon and I told a friend of mine from New York, and he also stopped by and also enjoyed his stay there."
8295,3889,4,0,5/18/2012,"Wow what a find!!! ˜Spicy, fresh and awsome"
8296,3889,4,0,12/26/2011,"I ordered take-out from Jasmine Rice soon after it opened. It seemed the service might be a bit slow for the people who were dining in, but I was very happy with the quality of the food. My husband and I got two noodle dishes and split a salad, and they all were wonderful."
8297,3889,4,0,9/24/2011,"This is a good new Thai place in the site of the old Warsaw Cafe. My wife and I have been three times since it opened about a week ago, and each of the six dishes we've tried has been great. My favorite so far is the Pad Khimao, which was nice and spicy. If you're not into spicy food, most of the other dishes are mild (the menu alerts you to the spicier ones, and you can also specify your preferred spiciness on a 1-5 scale). The service has been good, both for take-out and dining in. And the space has been decorated very tastefully. Since it's on a residential part of 16th St., just south of Spruce, there's a very nice neighborhood-treasure-to-be feeling to the restaurant. The slightly out-of-the-way location seems to have limited their business so far, but hopefully the crowds will start coming once the word of mouth advertising spreads about their good food. Jasmine Rice is worth a try. Good food, friendly service, and a nicely decorated space."
8298,3889,5,0,12/10/2014,"Jasmine Rice has the perfect ambiance for a small byob - its tucked in the heart of center city, but as soon as you walk inside you feel like you are visiting a friend. I have been eating here for the past 3 years and the food has never been disappointing. My favorites are the lemongrass soup, pad thai and all of the curries. Writing this review makes me want to go back tonight!"
8299,3889,5,0,6/19/2013,My favorite lunch spot. ˜Best lemon grass soup anywhere. ˜Also love the curry dishes. ˜Great BYOB for dinner too.
8300,3889,5,0,11/24/2012,"I enjoyed this restaurant and already plan on coming back for future meals. ˜I split the Crispy Spring Rolls with a friend and ordered the Chicken Pad Khimao for myself. Both dishes were delicious, and I was especially impressed with the entree. ˜The prices were reasonable and I was even able to take enough food home with me for the next day's lunch. ˜The decor and service were great, too, with fresh orchids on all the tables and a very attentive and friendly owner who came over to check on us more than once. I'm looking forward to returning and trying the Papaya Salad and the White Elephant dessert that I only noticed when I was already too full for more, although it will be difficult not to order the Pad Khimao again, as it was so good the first time!"
8301,3889,5,0,3/25/2012,Came for lunch and left extremely satisfied. ˜The decor is clean and bright. ˜Service was quick and each of our entrees was delicious. Started with the papaya salad and the crab nuggets. ˜The papaya salad was exceptional - so much flavor and still felt light. I had the vegetarian jasmine friend rice which was very flavorful even without any additional sauce. ˜One friend had the panang curry which was fantastic. ˜I've had panang curry at other Thai places and they tend to be overwhelmingly spicy. ˜This one was spicy but let the sweetness of the curry come through. ˜My other friend had the pad thai - a simple dish but done exactly right. ˜We will definitely be back!
8302,3889,5,0,12/7/2011,"Great service, good selection of vegetarian items including some I had not seen. I also recommend their thai iced coffee."
8303,3889,5,1,1/5/2015,"Try the vegetarian pad see ew! It was super super yummy came with broad noodles that had the perfect amount of flavor and onions bell peppers, egg and broccoli and green beans. Also came with delicious tofu if you get the veggie version. Really really great food! Can't wait to go back."
8304,3889,2,1,12/29/2014,"We came here for a friend's birthday. There were around 15 of us so I think that's why the wait for food was so slow. It took a really long time for the food to come out and it came out in sections so not all of us got our food at the same time. I got the Sriracha Calamari and Crispy Duck Fried Rice. The portions are really small and I wasn't full at all. The calamari was average, nothing special. The duck was really dry and dissatisfying. The service was friendly and it's BYOB but besides that I'm not a fan of the food at all."
8305,3889,2,1,12/22/2014,"I really wanted to like this place. People seem kind and conveniently located in center city. Wasn't able to find decent thai place in center city so I was excited to try new spot. Sadly couldn't reach my expectation. We ordered 4 appetizers and 2 main dishes for two ppl. I know it sounds a lot for two ppl but was good decision to order that much. Otherwise we would be left hungry. Got fried calamari, coconut soup, steamed mussels and spring rolls for appetizer. As some of others mentioned already the portions are tiny here. Soup size was ridiculous. Smallest soup I've never had.Spring roll size was about my pinky, was delicious but tiny tiny.. Those two appetizers were extremely small even for starter. For main dish we got pad Thai with beef and red curry with chicken. Pad Thai was really ˜sweet. Maybe too sweet even for Americanized thai food. Red curry broth ˜was delicious, was creamy and good amount of spice. But there wasn't enough soup. They serve curry on flat plate so they can't hold enough soup for curry and rice. I am not sure why they choose use that plate for soupy dishes. Curry broth was ˜amazing but green bean and carrot weren't cooked at all. I wanted to give one star to be honest but only reason I gave two star was the server was very kind and gave me more broth for my curry. The extra curry broth he brought ˜was bigger portion ˜than my coconut soup btw."
8306,3889,2,1,12/14/2014,"I've gotten take out from here a couple times since I live around the corner. The first time I got green curry and my bf got pad Thai. We love Thai food and both of us have eaten a lot of it. Jasmine Rice just wasn't up to our standards and the portions were a bit small for the price. They also messed up my order and gave me chicken instead of tofu. I was super hungry (and I'm not vegetarian) so I just ate it, but I wasn't thrilled. I succumbed to ordering from here again when I wanted some soup on a rainy day. I was craving some super sour and spicy tom yum soup, but the tom yum from Jasmine had a very sweet flavor to it and just left me yearning for the real stuff! And once again the to-go portion was surprisingly small. I don't hate the place, but it just doesn't satisfy my Thai food cravings."
8307,3889,3,1,12/11/2014,"Had dinner here last night with a friend. It's a small, quaint place. It wasn't too crowded last night around 7. My friend got the chicken satay skewers and I got the ginger dumplings. The dumplings were delicious and crunchy. The sauce for the satay skewers was also very tasty. For our entrees we both go Chicken Pad Thai. It was ok. The portion was a little on the smaller side and it didn't have as much peanut flavor as I prefer. My friend had been there before and got the Duck dish and said it was amazing. The service was good and prompt. I would try Jasmine Rice again and try a different entree."
5097,3889,5,1,12/11/2014,"I've been walking past Jasmine Rice for months and months, and always wondered about it, but was happy enough with Circles that I never gave it a chance. ˜Finally, I tried it with a friend for dinner and we haven't gone back to Circles since! ˜ Jasmine Rice is a more affordable and, in my opinion, even better-quality Thai food option. ˜It's also really convenient to pick up from there instead of having to order from Circles. ˜ We loved sitting in the restaurant - it has a very calm and laid-back ambiance. ˜It's not pretentious, but still very classy. ˜ I loved the Chicken Massaman curry - my friend loved it so much that it's her new go-to. ˜Their classic Chicken Pad Thai is my personal favorite, but I do like that they have a nice variety for when I'm feeling more adventurous. ˜ I always get a small Veggie Coconut Soup. ˜The broth is really light, with a hint of lemon and has just the right amount of veggies. ˜It's a nice way to start any meal. ˜ Their spring rolls are just average, I think I'd like to try their spicy Thai Basil Meatballs next time instead as they get really good reviews on Yelp - update to come! Their Thai Iced Tea is good, just a classic. ˜I liked it to go and in the restaurant, so no difference there. Their Chicken Pad Thai is pretty huge - when I get it as take out, it usually lasts me two full meals, and by full, I mean that I'm really full after eating about half! ˜It's just your typical Pad Thai - nice rice noodles, great sauce and some peanuts sprinkled on top. ˜Mostly, I just find the quality to be really good - no MSG or any gross aftertaste that I've been fighting to avoid with take-out. ˜My roommate still prefers Circles in this department because theirs is more garlicky and has more of a kick, but I prefer Jasmine Rice's milder take, so it all depends on your preferences. ˜I think I get a bigger portion at Jasmine Rice too, so that makes a difference! The Chicken Massaman curry is a really tasty - it's has potatoes, carrots, chunks of onions and sprinkled with peanuts. ˜The sauce is tasty, mild, although don't get it if you aren't a fan of coconut. ˜I loved it because I can't handle anything very spicy, but do enjoy rich flavors. ˜This was a great dish for someone who doesn't want to compromise on something bland, but isn't in the mood for something super spicy! ˜FYI - Order it with rice - when my roommate ordered it as takeout it did not come with rice, so it wasn't something she had leftovers for the next day. ˜But it's still worth it, delicious flavors that don't overpower the veggies and chicken. ˜ The Green Curry with Chicken was spicy, but not too spicy. ˜It wasn't anything super exciting in my opinion, I much preferred the Massaman to it! The owners are also very nice - and the service is great. ˜It takes 20-30 minutes for the food to be ready if you order for take-out. ˜I've generally waited a few minutes when I got there right at 20 minutes during peak dinner hours, so I might give them five more minutes next time. ˜But they're very friendly and make it easy to pay while you wait. Just FYI - it's BYOB if you go there, as their website suggests! ˜So don't forget to bring your own wine!"
8308,3889,4,1,12/9/2014,"Oh, how I love Thai food. It's so flavorful and it burns in all the right ways. I've only gone to Jasmine Rice a few times, only for lunch, but my husband and I love it. We always get the red curry with chicken, 3 peppers hot. The only ""off"" thing I can say about it is that the chicken could be more tender. I agree with a previous yelper that said it's like they threw the chicken in and tossed it around for a few minutes. Other than that, it's my current ""go to"" for Thai. My heartburn doesn't thank me for the spices, but that's what they make Pepcid for right? The owner is very sweet, too."
8309,3889,5,1,12/9/2014,"This place is so good but not enough people go here. Help support them, they have amazing food and service."
8310,3889,4,1,12/5/2014,"Love. It. Take out is quick and always hits the spot. Owner is super friendly and if you bite the bullet, the Thai spicy burns in all the right ways. Brown rice is extra though =("
8311,3889,5,1,12/3/2014,"I normally don't like any type of coconut curry, but man the red curry here was on point. Yum!"
8312,3889,4,1,11/22/2014,"I'm usually not a person that takes the time to formally commend a restaurant on good service, but this is an exception. My reservation at Jasmine Rice was set for 7:30p on a Friday evening. It was a very busy night but despite being seated at close to 8:00p, the host kept me and my party informed of the delay and made sure we were comfortable and exercised patience. For my meal, I chose the beef fried rice and without a doubt, it was the BEST decision I could've made. The food was prepared exquisitely with spice, texture, style, and presentation. It was very fresh. It also had a spice level just on the cusp of being too much. Nonetheless, the dish was a bit. The rest of my party enjoyed their meals as well and routinely commented on the taste of everything. The coconut and miso soup as appetizers were about average. If you're looking for an intimate small restaurant with its own flare right in the heart of center city, Jasmine Rice is a top contender."
8313,3889,3,1,11/15/2014,"Went here for Friday night dinner. ˜We made reservations which was good because it was crowded. ˜The place is small and tightly packed but once you are seated, you should be good. T ordered the Ginger Scallion Dumplings and I the Jasmine Rice Salad. ˜The dumplings were very hot but evidently delightful and my salad was fresh and had perfectly pan seared tofu and a delicious curry peanut dressing. For main entrees, T ordered the Jatujak stir-fry and I the Panang Curry with tofu. ˜WE were both slightly concerned about the portion sizes because they looked rather small. ˜But by small, I actually mean perfectly sized and once we finished eating, we were both full but not uncomfortable, as so often happens to us when we eat yummy food. ˜The main courses were very flavorful, although T wanted more spice and I wanted less. ˜ The staff was really nice and they were filling our water like crazy. While everything was tasty and the service was good, there wasn't really anything that stood out about Jasmine Rice. ˜It is a very solid Thai restaurant and if I happen to be in the area and craving Thai, I will definitely be back but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so."
8314,3889,5,1,11/11/2014,"Warm, intimate authentic food served by husband and wife owners. Small menu allows the kitchen to really shine. ˜Impeccable service that obliges both causal groups and the many dates that the New York style dining room invites. ˜Must eat: Meatballs, Green Curry Fried Rice, Pad Kee Mao."
8315,3889,3,1,10/30/2014,"The thing I love about this place is the customer service. This is only my second time coming here but the waitress is always so friendly and very attentive. The food is made fresh so it sometimes takes a little longer to come out, but it's a nice quiet environment so I don't mind the time to relax. The only downside to this place is the food. It's not that the food is bad, I just haven't been wowed by anything I've ordered here yet."
8316,3889,3,1,10/27/2014,"Food was decent, but does not stand up to the Smile Cafe - Erawan standard. The drunken noodle was flavorful but quite greasy. The pad thai was good. Very courteous staff. Will definitely return if Smile Cafe is closed."
8317,3889,2,1,10/23/2014,"Oh Jasmine Rice, there was a point when I raved about your amazing-ness but alas, I was let down recently. Cons: -the proportion sizes were way too small. You can't share dishes and entrees like how Asian food is usually meant to be family style. -Had two different curries and each time, the meat was dry! The meat is supposed to be soft and tender from soaking in all the curry. This tasted like they just threw in a pan and tossed it around for like 15 minutes. Pros: -the service here is really nice, the speak Thai and it's sweet. -in the summer they make really good mango and sticky rice dessert. -the only good dish seemed to be the Drunken noodles"
8318,3889,2,1,10/19/2014,"I'm going to to say 2 out of 5. Had dinner here last night. Ordered the Panaeng And Massaman Curry to find that I had plenty of carrots on my plate, barely any meats that were ordered on it, (chicken and beef) and a little mini scoop of rice. I'm talking like Baskin Robins' kid scoop to the kid scoop. It tasted decent, close to what Panaeng curry should taste like but I was like almost shocked as to just how many carefully cut out carrot designs were on my plate compared to the actual meat, rice and curry that I'm looking to have........"
8319,3889,5,1,10/1/2014,"Very tasty Thai food! ˜I mostly get take out from here, but i have eaten in there once or twice. ˜Staff is always super friendly, my food is always ready when they say it will be and it's hot! ˜The green curry and pad kee mow (sp?) are my favorite!!"
8320,3889,5,1,9/27/2014,I visited last week. The food was delicious! I ordered the lemongrass soup and the pad thai. Very tasty and lovely presentation. I definitely would recommend it.
8321,3889,4,1,8/25/2014,"I had a Thai craving and this was the place to satisfy it! I had the coconut soup (small portion) and the green curry, both very delicious. This was the first time I had green beans or as many bamboo shoots but it was good. I ordered mine ""medium"" spicy and it was spot on! The perfect combination of taste, spicy, and $$."
8322,3889,4,1,8/18/2014,My boyfriend and I (yup the guy that took me to Relish on our 1st date :) ) decided to go to Jasmine Rice on a whim before we headed to the Kimmel Center for a show. We absolutely enjoyed our food! I got the Pad Kee Mao with chicken and he got Fried Jasmine Rice with chicken. We didn't bring a bottle of wine because we went on a whim but we will definitely go back with a nice bottle of wine in hand since it's BYOB.
8323,3889,5,1,8/10/2014,"Simple restaurant with such a down-to-earth ambiance. There's no music but the place fills up with stories, wonderful. The food was DELICIOUS! If I could, I would give them six stars. The spring rolls were simply delicous, so was the cripsy duck. Love that you can bring your own bottle of wine."
8324,3889,5,1,8/4/2014,"I love this place. I've picked up lunch while at work, had intimate dinners, and frequent take out and I am never disappointed. The owners are this cute Thai couple who are as nice as ever. The food is delicious- I love the Paneng Curry! The restaurant itself is tiny (townhouse living room sized) and the tables are a bit close to eachother. That's probably the only thing that isn't my favorite, but stopping by when it isn't busy makes for a pleasant experience."
8325,3889,5,1,7/27/2014,Great food nice atmosphere will be coming back!!!!
8326,3889,5,1,7/24/2014,"Enjoy your meal with Cool place, Cool service & Cool price. The food was delicious and seem like you have dinner in Thailand. Both of Boss, Khun Tom& Khun Ann are very nice, They take care every clients by themselves.....it's Great !!!Have a worth dinning today."
8327,3889,2,1,7/21/2014,"If all it takes to win stars is the location, then this place would definitely be top notch. Loved this feel of this little place! Cute little brick 2 story makes me excited to see what lies in store... Loved how intimate the setting is...Wood floors, white walls, filled with white draped tables intermingled with white-washed wooden posts. Makes everything seem like a blank canvas awaiting the colors and flavors of Thailand to grace the stage. Colorful Thai fare, yes! Flavorful Thai fare, not so much. Ordered a few of the staples I typically prefer on a first visit: Pad Kee Mao and Papaya Salad. Ordered both Medium heat since I'm fairly comfortable with Thai spice. Unfortunately, they either forgot to spice or they just went waaaayyyyyyy too easy on me. The colorful dishes left me yearning for missing flavors and spice. Lunch portions may be a bit smaller than Dinner. Maybe not...but come to think of it, having a larger portion of bland Thai leftovers might have been a bad thing to bring back to the hotel room. Guess my venture into the Philly Thai Cuisine scene just didn't work out. :("
8328,3889,4,1,7/6/2014,"Very yummy!!! It was my first time eating thai food so I stuck with what I knew, fried rice. ˜I had the beef fried rice and it was so good. My hubby had duck and it too was great. Overall great"
8329,3889,4,1,6/29/2014,"The food was quite delicious. I had the red curry and my friends had the Panang curry. There was no food left when we were done. I like my food spicy and I asked for level 5. That was wonderful for me. But beware, most people cannot handle that level of spic. The ambiance is very nice. It's not a huge place where you would get lost, nor is it a tiny place that you feel like you're touching elbows with your neighbor. The service was excellent, very friendly and fast. The only suggestion I would make is to increase the portion of rice. A half a cup may not be sufficient for most people."
8330,3889,5,1,6/23/2014,"Really great Panang Beef Curry. ˜Rich, creamy, and with perfectly cooked. ˜The vegetables were done just right. ˜The beef was shaved thin. ˜The rice was fragrant and just sticky enough to sop up all that good sauce. ˜Clean atmosphere. ˜Very friendly and pleasant service. ˜And, the prices make this place a good value."
8331,3889,4,1,6/14/2014,"One of my favorite Thai places in Philly. Mostly I go there because it's close to where I live, and the staff is really adorable -- they really care about their customers! I'm a big fan of their noodle dishes, the crab appetizer, and the duck fried rice. Their soups aren't my favorite, unfortunately, and I wouldn't recommend getting take-out/delivery, because it often arrives in a sub-par state. The fact that their BYO makes it a great place to go with a group!"
8332,3889,2,1,6/3/2014,"Nice people, but food is very sweet. We had the pad Thai and massaman curry, and couldn't stomach either."
8333,3889,4,1,5/15/2014,We live in Ca so we eat Thai food all the time. The noodles at this place are so tender I can't believe it. Good curry and one of the friendliest waitstaff ever.
8334,3889,5,1,5/3/2014,"The food is great! My usual order would be the duck fried rice and white elephant for dessert. The owner and his wife are sweet and easy going. With the many times my boyfriend and I have been to this place, the owner already knows our orders! We love it here!"
8335,3889,5,1,4/11/2014,"Most likely the nicest owners of an establishment I've met. ˜They are so caring and will go very much out of the way for you. ˜I love the Pad See Ew, and my boss always has the roasted duck."
8336,3889,5,1,4/8/2014,"The best green curry in philadelphia hands down. The shrimp are huge and there's so much of the bamboo shoots it will blow your mind. I love how they let you upgrade the spice level. The papaya salad was said to be award winning and I can see why. It's so fresh, tang, and tart. The tom yum soup was also very good they gave me more oil so I could control exactly how sour it was. The rolls were a little on the small side but tasty none the less~ I will forever be a loyal customer and fan of Jasmine Rice. I wanted to try they green curry rice dish and pad thai but the green curry is so good I just can't not order it!!!!!!!"
8337,3889,4,1,4/1/2014,"It was my fiance's birthday and he decided he wanted a good, laid back Thai restaurant for dinner. Yelp steered us in the Jasmine Rice direction, and it was definitely a good decision. We wanted the summer rolls, which were on the menu, but apparently will not be available until summer, so we settled on the pan-fried dumplings. The flavor was good, but I don't think we'd order them again. We got the green curry fried rice with duck and chicken pad thai. Both of those dishes were great, but the duck stole the show. That was some the of tastiest duck I've ever had. The pad thai was a bit sweet for us, so I think we'd try a different noodle dish when we return. But it was still very good, especially with some chili sauce mixed in. Our service was good, but other people had issues. One table was rushing to get to a show at the Kimmel Center and waited quite a while for their meal (and were going to be late). Another person who got take-out was missing one of their items (but the owner realized it and called him and walked the dish to his house, which was very nice). Overall, good quality Thai! We would definitely go back."
8338,3889,5,1,3/28/2014,"Always a winner. Great, well-priced food and super friendly service. BYOB. ˜Phad Thai and crispy duck are always good!"
6736,3889,4,1,3/23/2014,"I think easily the best Thai in center city. We got three appetizers: spring rolls, crab meat dumpling things and calamari and very good. Calamari was the best I've had in awhile. For the main course, I got the green curry with beef (spicy level 3). It was awesome and very spicy, I probably would get a 2 spicy level in future though. My friend got the salmon special which was incredible, and my gf got the stir fry (the one w the weird name) and that was incredible as well. All in all, great place for Thai food. The one con is that the service was slow and not very attentive. They were extremely busy so it is understandable."
8339,3889,5,1,3/22/2014,"Had yet another wonderful meal at Jasmine Rice last Saturday with my boyfriend and our friends. This time I had the pad Thai with salmon.... Amazingness!! Other dishes enjoyed by our party were the crispy duck over rice (delicious! and I'm typically not a duck fan), Talay Thai, and the king and I. Everyone left feeling satisfied and impressed. I also must say the atmosphere at Jasmine Rice is so much more comfortable and relaxed than some of the other byobs. ˜I can't say enough about the staff here - everyone is so helpful and very attentive. We will be back again soon!"
8340,3889,5,1,3/21/2014,It little cafe which have great food. ˜ Awesome green curry. ˜And shrimpburi salad. ˜If you want smt exotic & tasty u will find it here! ˜Love it.
6953,3889,4,1,3/20/2014,"Cute location, cozy environment - doesn't have the usual Thai feel, but solid food. I've been here on two occasions. The first time, I already had dinner, so I tried their Thai iced tea and mango sticky rice dessert. Taste was as expected = good. Second time, I got the pad thai (I am so adventurous I know...), and again, it was solid. Portions were decently large, and I couldn't finish my portion. If you have a small appetite, you could probably split it into two meals. If you like your food spicy, you can ask for extra chili sauce on the side, and they bring you this fresh made chili sauce! I didn't try any, but it looked really good!"
8341,3889,5,1,3/11/2014,"Intimate setting with extremely friendly service, and delicious food. My boyfriend and I ordered the crab nuggets as an appetizer - which were very flavorful and packed with crab and shrimp meat, then wrapped in a thin layer of tofu. ˜Perfect start to the meal. I ordered the Green Curry Fried Rice with Chicken and it was great! Definitely had a spicy kick to it, but the flavor was really bright, intense, and delicious. ˜ My boyfriend ordered The King & I - which had shrimp and chicken and a bunch of vegetables in an equally delicious and bright sauce that made the dish very tasty. ˜ The portions were very generous for the main courses - definitely could have only eaten half and taken the rest as leftovers. Will definitely return!"
8342,3889,5,1,2/24/2014,Very very good restaurant! The food was sooo good and the service was great too!!!! Definitely coming back again:))
8343,3889,5,1,2/17/2014,"Incredibly friendly service and owners, homemade authentic food, and a warm interior make for an excellent experience! I love everything about this place! They also are very conscious of vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free needs"
8344,3889,5,1,2/9/2014,"Excellent service and delicious, authentic Thai food. Our server/the owner was very helpful in describing the food and how it is made, when we asked. The Satay Chicken and Crispy Spring Rolls appetizers were amazing - especially the homemade sauces for each! ˜Entree size was a little smaller than at some other Thai places, but that may be because we ordered from the lunch menu. Reasonably priced, especially for the neighborhood. We will definitely return!"
8345,3889,3,1,2/6/2014,"Good not great! sweet atmosphere and kind servers, there was totally nothing wrong with the food it just didn't blow me away. coconut soup - not the best I've ever had but really fine, tasty and satisfying Thai basil meatballs - the best thing we ordered. Nice char on the meat and they came with what appeared to be fried basil leaves, which were kind of awesome Golden triangles - fried tofu, don't bother I'm local so maybe I'll be back if I'm craving Thai."
8346,3889,3,1,2/4/2014,"I was excited to try this place and hoping that it broke me out of my Thai Coconut Soup and Chick Pad Thai craze I've been stuck in (thanks My Thai...) and I think its the perfect place for that. ˜The service was lacking a bit, we had everything we needed but the server just seemed a little frazzled and the dinner definitely took longer than it needed to. ˜ - Ginger Scallion Dumplings were fantastic! - Spring rolls were kind of boring, not terrible but definitely have had better at most thai places. - Siam Salmon was cooked very well and the sweet, spicy combo was pretty great."
8347,3889,4,1,1/18/2014,"The service here is great and the environment is relaxing, but the food is closer to a 3 or 3.5 than a 4. I will continue to go to Jasmine Rice, and if the food reaches a 4 or 5 status I will update this review. However, in the meantime, I am checking out other Thai food places in the area."
8348,3889,5,1,1/13/2014,"Yes, the food was great and yes, the decor was cozy and adorable. However, the reason I'm giving this place five stars is because of the service. To be fair, I went on a random Sunday afternoon so they weren't busy. I couldn't tell you what it would be like while it's busy, but the service I received was excellent. The server was extremely helpful and friendly. I will definitely be going back!!"
8349,3889,4,1,1/9/2014,"I stopped in for lunch with a friend, and was greeted with the aromatic waft of delicious Thai food, a friendly welcome and quick seating. The restaurant was clean, well lit, and quiet for a weekday meal. We ordered Crispy Spring Rolls to share, two orders of the lemon grass soup, a Pad See Ew and a Panaeng Curry. The spring rolls and soups came quickly, and the rolls were beautifully golden and crispy and the soups fragrant and tangy with just the right amount of lemon grass and lime. My order of pad see ew was appropriately sweet and garlic savory, the curry spicy with crisp carrots, string beans and peppers. Overall, service was good and the food delicious. Would definitely dine at Jasmine Rice again."
8350,3889,5,1,11/25/2013,"Just loved everything I ate in this restaurent! Chicken Satay, green Curry are unforgettable!"
8351,3889,3,1,11/20/2013,"I really appreciated that they squeezed us in the night before the marathon, but my search for great Thai continues. ˜I went with Pad Thai with shrimp, at a 2 spice level. ˜The spice was perfect, but the sauce was too sweet, and it seemed like they ran a knife a few time through the noodles. ˜They were really short which made it hard to eat."
8352,3889,4,1,11/15/2013,"Maybe I just love any place that is a BYOB because when I am drinking as much wine as I want, I tend to have an enjoyable experience. That being said, this place is great. ˜The servers were so kind and friendly. ˜The atmosphere is really nice, but it is tiny. ˜The spring rolls were pretty tasty. ˜My Pad See Ewe was delicious. ˜My friend got the Penang curry and his meal was on point. ˜I guess the only complaint is the fact that as others have said, I usually have a lot of leftovers when I eat at Thai restaurants, but this time I had none..but that could've been the wine inside me eating all of the delicious food. I would definitely go back!"
5094,3889,5,1,11/12/2013,"I came here two weeks ago for the first time and I have to say i was pretty impressed. The food here is on point, there wasn't anything that was bad about. It's a nice small restaurant and you do wait a little bit for the food to come out after you placed your order. But don't get to mad that the food you got came to late as you won't be disappointed. I suggest getting the chicken red curry really nice and although even though the spice level was at a two it def seemed hotter than two l think it was either level 4 or their hottest Thai hot. Do come here as this is a very good restaurant for family outings"
8353,3889,4,1,11/4/2013,"One of the best Thai restaurants in the City. The interior design of the restaurant is like a little piece of Thailand. The service is nothing short of amazing. And the food is full of flavorful spices and hits the spot on a weekend date night. My favorite dish is the Green Curry- bamboo shoots with string beans, peppers, chicken strips, and fresh Thai basil. Paired with hot tea and a view of the City, this makes for the perfect dining experience. The only forewarning is that the portion sizes are fairly smaller than you would expect. Enough to fill me up, but definitely not as large as Lemongrass Thai restaurant near Drexel U. Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant. I have been there 3 times so far."
8354,3889,4,1,11/3/2013,"Jasmine Rice is the 7th Thai BYOB restaurant I've been to in Philly. Jasmine Rice exceeded expectations; the service was friendly & well paced (on a Saturday night when the majority of the restaurant was full), and the food was tasty. I had the Beef Thani which was really flavorful (it had a TON of garlic, which I love, but a warning to those on a date night!). My friends are all vegetarians and got various noodle & veggie dishes- everyone cleared their plate and was really satisfied. I'm giving -1 star for the portion size/price ratio. When I get Thai I'm used to being able to take home half my dinner & still feel full, for the same price. However, Jasmine Rice puts out great tasting food and is so close to my house, it will probably become a new go-to place for me."
8355,3889,5,1,8/13/2013,"We had an awesome time at Jasmine Rice last night! We were celebrating two birthdays, and had a large group of 14 people, and Tom was great to work with from start to finish. ˜He was very accommodating when making the reservations, the food was delicious, and in the end he brought out cupcakes for us! Definitely one of the best (quality, price, environment) birthday experiences I have had in the city!"
8356,3889,5,1,8/5/2013,"Best Thai I've had in the city out of the four places I've tried. The service is amazing. The owners are extremely nice and will cater to whatever you need, especially food allergies. I've only had lunches there but have never had a problem with the food taking too long. Since the owner's wife is the only chef, I imagine if it's really busy, it would take a little while but it is worth the wait in my opinion. My favorite dish is the green curry fried rice with shrimp. It's pretty spicy but has a great flavor and the shrimp is always tender. It's a lot of food to eat but somehow I always manage to finish. I've also had the duck fried rice and that's also very good. The papaya salad is my goto appetizer as it has a great crunch and tastes great. They do theirs slightly different than most places as it doesn't have any dried shrimp or fish sauce. As far as I know, it's vegan. Doesn't detract from the flavor at all and I actually prefer it. My coworkers love the crab nuggets. They tend to sell out of those quickly though. The prices aren't too much different than other Thai places. If they're slightly higher, it's cause they're food is slightly better. One day I'll go there to dinner with my fiance and add onto this review."
8357,3889,2,1,8/2/2013,"Unless you have hours to spend sitting in a one room house structure, don't come here. Just one waiter and it literally takes an hour for the food to appear. The food is good though but I don't think its worth the wait"
8358,3889,4,1,5/27/2013,"I have struggled a bit to write this review - as I definitely liked my meal here, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to eat here with other options around. ˜I was graciously invited to a friend's graduation celebration dinner here, and as we were a large group - and they have a tiny space, it was nice of them to accommodate us. ˜We enjoyed a large 5 courses or so - starting with spring rolls or soup - both of which were delicious, followed by a papaya salad, red curry, fried rice, and pad see ew noodles. ˜At the end of the meal we were given sticky rice with mango. Here's my thoughts on all of them: Spring rolls - normal, good, but totally didn't stand out Soup - only tried my friend's, tasted good and fresh, but again, nothing amazing Papaya Salad - a little too peanuty, but well prepared and presented Red curry - my favorite and delicious - well seasoned, well made, fresh vegi's, delicious Fried rice - really not very good in my opinion, rather bland Pad See Ew - best thing I ate - it was fantastically made, and really very well sauced, which I like, but some people don't Sticky Rice - good, not great - I had two bites and felt satisfied / didn't want any more. I do like that it's BYOB - but be warned, it's tiny, so if it's busy, good luck. ˜ The service was great, it was definitely clean, and a lovely place. ˜I just don't know that I'd go here with Circles a hike away. It is comparable to Sawatdee not too far away, so if it's super crowded and you want a comparable meal, definitely go here."
8359,3889,5,1,5/22/2013,"Love this place. BYOB right off rittenhouse, with a relatively simple menu that offers all of the Thai basics. You have the choice of any meat to add to any of the rice/noodle/curry dishes, and the service is fast. Cute little intimate enviornment... And the owner and his wife work diligently to ensure you are a satisfied customer. 1 app + 2 entrees = about $35. Can't go wrong... I recommend the red curry with shrimp and the green curry mussels as an app. Can't wait to go back."
8360,3889,5,1,5/13/2013,"Excellent pad Thai! Delicious Thai iced tea, definitely recommend. Very small space, doubt they can accommodate more than 6 in a table. Nice people, slow waiters."
8361,3889,4,1,4/27/2013,"Food: Very good, above average Thai cuisine. Price: I hate to say it but the prices have risen from how they are currently shown on the online menues, to the point of entrees being about $3-5 more in the restaurant. Service: Impeccable! Couldn't be nicer We started going here when they opened and thought we had found our new go-to Thai spot. As time went on we started realized our bills were getting bigger but our orders were staying the same. I hope this will be corrected soon because the menu on their website & menupages list entres for about $3-5 cheaper then they cost when our bill came in the restaurant. Food is great, service is great, just make sure you pay attention to your bill or double check the final order price if your placing an order for pick up."
8362,3889,5,1,4/9/2013,I love this place. ˜Great thai food and a wonderful staff. ˜Always very welcoming. ˜I've never had a wait but it is good to see this place is filling up on weekends. ˜BYOB is added plus. ˜I love their thai curry - it isn't as spicy as all that! ˜Their tofu options are also excellent. ˜Prices are just right for thai food. ˜Far better food than the others in the neighborhood.
8363,3889,2,1,4/3/2013,"Definitely the worst Thai food I've had in Philadelphia. ˜The chicken was bone dry and the pad thai had too much tamarind (it was all tamarind and not much of any other flavor) and no veggies! ˜Also, they give you a small bowl of rice and charge you $1 if you want more! ˜Rice should be free yo! The only reason why I'm not giving it just one star is because the waiter was very nice (even though he got my order wrong)."
8364,3889,3,1,3/30/2013,"Went on a saturday morning ˜- one of 3 customers at the restaurant. ˜The place was quite but nice. ˜I ordered the masaman with duck. ˜I wasn't really expecting grilled duck with gravy poured over it. ˜And the chef forgot to add the potatoes. ˜Either way, the gravy was really good. ˜The server was nice and the thai iced tea was good too."
8365,3889,4,1,3/29/2013,"I am a huge Thai food junkie and I love trying new places but rarely do any of them compare to my usual spots. I ordered the Pad Se-ew (vegetarian) and it was delicious. A generous serving with crispy tofu and fresh veggies. My table also ordered the dumplings, which are usually my favorite. They were good, but I have never had anything but steamed dumplings at Thai restaurants, and I think it's what I prefer, as these were a bit greasy. Still good though. Cute place, a little quiet if it's not busy, but once people start filing in it's not too bad. Very friendly service, and I didn't find it slow at all. Perhaps because it was a Sunday, but the restaurant was reasonably busy."
8366,3889,5,1,1/27/2013,great lemon grass soup and fried rice. the waiter was very helpful about my food allergies and let me know which items on the menu were safe for me to eat and which could be modified to be safe. it was all i could hope for with dining out in the city and i highly recommend it to anyone with a gluten allergy.
8367,3889,4,1,1/23/2013,"I had a hankering for Thai and Jasmine Rice was very close to where I was when said cravings occurred. After checking out the reviews and deciding to go for curry rather than a noodle dish, I placed an order for the green curry with shrimp. The food was done quickly and I was on my way. The portion size was generous and there were five or so very large shrimp and lots of crisp, fresh veggies. The curry was flavorful, with a little heat, and not too heavy. The rice was perfectly sticky and delicious. I was very pleasantly surprised by Jasmine Rice (based on some of the reviews I read), but I will definitely think of them next time I have a curry craving."
5095,3889,4,1,12/21/2012,"I've been to a lot of Thai places in Philly and the red curry here is the best! I could and do drink the coconut red curry sauce. Pad thai, pad see ew, and penang curry are aso delicious. Green curry mussels were soo good as well. Sirracha calamari is so-so. BYOB. Extremely friendly service and very attentive. Gets a little noisy if the place is crowded."
8368,3889,2,1,12/20/2012,"{ International Wednesday Post } Checked out this adorable little BYOB for international Wednesday, and found it to be just alright. The 2 person tables in the windows are way to close together, there is no privacy. The service was a bit awkward and although the food was alright, I have had WAY better Thai for much less money."
8369,3889,4,1,12/16/2012,"nice, compact menu with a lot of interesting flavors. ˜mussels with green curry sauce comes with crispy basil, and the shrimp rolls are fried but not greasy. ˜dishes aren't too heavy, and even the spicy ones don't leave your mouth ringing and your brain wondering why you ordered them. ˜the drunken duck (not always on the menu) was a great treat -- crispy green beans, even more crispy skinned duck that was tender and in a smooth peanut sauce. ˜ringed by some flaming rum, it was one of the most inventive and original thai dishes i've had."
8370,3889,2,1,12/16/2012,"Ate at the restaurant once and grabbed take out another time. Have to say I am disappointed in their execution of pad thai, pad see ew, and appetizers (the spring rolls & dumplings are too fried and greasy, not enough filling). The one good thing was the curry dish. Fantastic service and a cute, small dining room but the food isn't up to par."
8371,3889,4,1,12/7/2012,"Loved this place! ˜The service was amazing, they were busy but made us feel special, and we didn't even have a reservation or a special event planned. ˜The owner came over and talked to us like we were friends, not strangers and he smiled a genuine and caring smile...something was so nice about this. ˜He really seemed happy to be there and happy that we were there. ˜This is so rare in many businesses and restaurants in Philly. ˜The food was delicious. ˜We had the flaming duck. ˜It was not on the dinner menu, but we saw someone else with it, asked the waiter about it, and they were happy to make it for our table. ˜It was tender and flavorful, really an A plus meal. ˜The place is small and cozy but not too over crowded and it was relatively quiet for the number of people that were there. ˜You could comfortably talk to your date without raising your voice, but at the same time there was an energy around you. ˜The table in front of us had a large baby stroller with them and the waiter pulled out the chairs and removed them so that the stroller would fit comfortably into the dinner table. ˜That is good customer service. ˜I highly recommend this place for an affordable, special night. ˜The price was good for the quality of food and service."
8372,3889,3,1,11/27/2012,Although I liked the appetizers we got there ˜was not impressed with their version of Phad Thaii but that could be personal preference. It's honey based and a bit sweeter then I normally like.
8373,3889,5,1,11/14/2012,"We truly enjoyed our meal here. The owner was so kind and attentive, the food was very good and the portions were perfect. The location is a little off the beaten path but it's worth looking for. A very quaint restaurant, almost like eating in your own home dining room. A safe bet for Asian food in Philly."
8374,3889,5,1,10/14/2012,"It's a really cute little cozy place, with super friendly staff and very prompt service. ˜The food was very good, as well. ˜No complaints!"
8375,3889,3,1,10/11/2012,"Finally made it here post Midtown Village Festival. Our posse rolls deep i mean like 12 or more so that fact that they could seat us right away when i called was awesome. We had to split into 3 groups of 4 but that was not an issue for us as we were famished and needing to continue to drink. ˜My one beef with this place is that everything took soooooooooo lonngggggggg ˜(maybe it was just that i was slightly drunk and very hungry). We waited for what felt like an eternity to place our orders,to get our starters and entrees. Since Jasmine is known for their curries I decided on the panaeng curry for its coconut base. Jasmine offers multiple levels of heat for all tastes so you can customize your food to your liking.When our food finally arrived i dived right into to the curry and was pretty impressed with the depth of flavor. The curry had a slight sweetness to it from the coconut base but i opted for level 3 heat and that kick balanced out the dish quite nicely. The portion size was right on point for the price. This is a great option for anyone that maybe doesn't want to make the trek to NoLibs or South Philly ˜to order Circles. Its a BYOB and they accept cards. The only reason I cant rate it higher was the slow service. I must make a return visit to try some of the other curries."
8376,3889,5,1,8/21/2012,"Food was wonderful, especially for the price. ˜We had coconut soup, lemon grass soup, chicken satay spears, veg pad thai and shrimp in curry sauce. ˜All of the tastes was full bodied and the ""one pepper"" spicey designation was suitable for an American who likes spicey, but not overpowering food. ˜Service was prompt and attentive, the decor clean and quiet. ˜Tom (owner) and wife Anna (chef) have been in this location for a year replacing the East European restaurant that ""retired"" recently. ˜They have some 20 years experience in restauranting, which shows in the menu and preparation. ˜The menu is a 50-50 combination of traditional Thai dishes and Tom and Annna's creations in Thai cuisine. ˜The whole menu is available for take-away, which given the neighborhood of young professionals is a brisk business. ˜Nice people, great food, great prices, BYOB."
8377,3889,3,1,8/18/2012,"BYOB made all the difference! Food was just okay, nothing to write home about but not awful either. Stay away from the calamari. Ours may have just been overlooked but my goodness, they shouldn't have served it. Curry was tasty but they give you such a tiny scoop of rice you'll have to ask for more multiple times. I'm sure there is better Thai around but if you find yourself in the area and you have a bottle of wine, check it out. Maybe..."
8378,3889,3,1,7/15/2012,"Update: Recently, I've had some not-so-great meals from here. My last one was particularly disappointing. We ordered the Pad Thai, which was nothing special, and several appetizers (tapas style.) They were flavorless and cheap. I won't be ordering from here again. They're very friendly, but the food just isn't great. -----(original post)----- I've only had take out from here, so I can't speak to the restaurant's service/atmosphere. However, the food is very good. Creative dishes, super reasonable prices, and flavorful, hearty proportions make this my go-to Asian place. I've had a couple of chicken dishes which were very good and included fresh veggies and a shrimp dish which was surprisingly good. The shrimp was not overcooked (amazingly!) and the sauce was tasty but light. If you're in the mood for Asian takeout, Jasmine Rice is a wonderful option."
8379,3889,4,1,7/8/2012,"This place can be defined as a Thai place with a twist. The owner cum chef uses his heritage and combines it with the modern. You can be assured that the food that comes on your table is as fresh as it gets. Extremely child friendly and warm people made this an amazing lunch for us. Though the dessert menu could use some more items, you mustn't miss the white elephant. Can't wait to come back and try the drunken duck :)"
8380,3889,3,1,5/13/2012,"3.5 stars. Decent, pretty average thai food. ˜Nothing spectacular, but still a satisfying meal. ˜The prices are standard for the Rittenhouse area. ˜All the waitresses were super friendly, and although our food took a while to come out...everything was super HOT. Overall, if you're on an expedition for the BEST thai food in Philly--look elsewhere. ˜However, this is quite a charming restaurant...perfect for date night or a quiet meal with friends. ˜Bonus point for BYO."
8381,3889,5,1,5/4/2012,We just left after enjoying an amazing lunch! Chicken shrimp fried rice and chicken stir fry! Mindy was sweet and was very attentitive. Plus the entire menu and Thai tea was the best!
8382,3889,4,1,4/20/2012,"I went out on a second date to Jasmine Rice because I looove Thai food, even though I can't name most of the dishes. ˜It was Saturday night, so the place was packed and there was only one table available RIGHT next to kitchen-Yikes! ˜But they quickly made up for this inconvenience with excellent service. They were on! If they saw I was done with my appetizer silverware, they promptly replaced it with our entree cutlery. ˜They saw my water running low...seconds later, it was filled. It was like watching a well orchestrated waiter ballet. ˜I started to sway in my seat. ˜Then came the choreographer of this perfect dance. ˜I believe his name was Bob. He created the menu and he took the time to explain it and suggested something that was...mmmm! I wish I remembered the name of it, but it was duck and sweet and spicy and exactly what I wanted. ˜Aside from the food, I believe that Bob was the best part of the experience. ˜He was informative, jovial and really was the icing of an already wonderful dining experience. If I had to complain about anything it would be the size. ˜Intimacy is one thing, but at one point I felt like I could reach over and have some of our neighbor's appetizers and they would be none the wiser. ˜But if they continue with their top-notch service, expansion should be inevitable. Loved it!"
8383,3889,4,1,4/19/2012,"Context: Dinner with a Friend Time of Visit: Friday, 10:00PM My experience with Jasmine Rice was an excellent one! This BYO spot is a little on the small side, so I would recommend groups of 4 or smaller. ˜Atmosphere is very calm and intimate. ˜When we were there, it was not very crowded, so the staff was very attentive: they had our bottle of wine open as soon as the waitress approached the table. The entrees all looked appetizing: I tried the thai noodles with chile peppers and onions. ˜ ˜You can choose your level of spice for some of the meals: I think it skews towards the spicy side. ˜I have a moderately high spice tolerance, but my 3-pepper (out of 5 total) dish was pretty spicy. ˜I would like to clarify that this is no fault of JR: I asked for the 3. What was nice was that the staff could see my red face/sweating, and refilled my water glass the second it was empty. ˜While this is probably attributable to the time of visit, I still appreciate their attention to my spice-induced distress. ˜Dishes were moderately priced and portion sizes were just right. I will definitely be back to Jasmine Rice-excellent Thai cuisine, but I will ask for it less spicy!"
8384,3889,5,1,4/16/2012,"My husband and I stumbled across this place by chance after wandering about Rittenhouse Sq. for half an hour trying to find a suitable, reasonably priced place for dinner. ˜(We're from out of town.) I would give this restaurant 5 stars based on service alone. ˜ We went in because we saw ""drunken duck"" on the sidewalk menu (and I love duck more than anything). ˜I tempered my expectations though, because I have a gluten allergy that prevents me from being able to eat dishes made with normal soy sauce and duck is usually prepared with soy sauce. ˜When I asked about it inside, the owner came over and explained that there is indeed soy sauce in the base. ˜But before my heart even had time to break, he told me that he could make a special version of it for me without the soy sauce. ˜A few minutes later, he brought out a ramekin of the sauce for me to taste test for spice level. ˜It was *delicious*. ˜ Needless to say, the dish was fantastic. ˜The sauce was a perfect mix of sweet, and spicy and the duck was crispy skinned with moist delicious meat inside. ˜Even the Chinese broccoli on which it was served was smoky and wonderful, having been doused in brandy & rum and set on fire! ˜(Extra credit for flair.) And lest I feel guilty that the chef/owner went to all this trouble for me, he came out again after we ate to tell me that he enjoyed the challenge of preparing the dish without soy sauce. ˜If only all chefs reacted that way to customers' dietary restrictions! ˜Talk about above and beyond... We will be back here for sure when we move to the city. (Oh, and my husband, who claims not to like Thai food, had a beef dish involving oyster sauce and he enjoyed it thoroughly.)"
8385,3889,4,1,4/14/2012,Very good Thai food. One of our favorite neighborhood spots. Love that it is a BYOB.
8386,3889,3,1,3/16/2012,Good food and quick service. It's not very atmospheric but the food is good.
8387,3889,4,1,2/27/2012,"I came here with 2 friends on a Saturday night and we had no problem grabbing a table. ˜I was quite surprised by the quality of the food here. ˜I ordered the Lemon Grass Soup and the Pad Khimao and both dishes were absolutely delicious and the portions are generous. ˜The waitress was attentive and kindly offered to help me select items off the menu since I was so indecisive. ˜This place is BYOB which to me, is an added bonus."
8388,3889,3,1,2/18/2012,"I wish I could give 3.5 stars but this will have to do. The restaurant is small yet tastefully decorated and warm-feeling, and the wait staff are friendly and attentive. We started off with the lemongrass soup which was spicy and delicious, filled with vegetables and tofu (we ordered the vegetarian version). I had ""The King and I"" (how apropos) and my husband had the penang curry with chicken. Our entrees were decent; however neither of us were blown away. There was a tremendous amount of chicken in both of our entrees but there wasn't a lot of sauce. Speaking of which, my sauce was disappointing in taste as well as quantity. The sauce was supposed to be a prik khing sauce, which is usually more red in color and spicy in taste. As prik khing sauce is a favorite of mine, I could tell immediately that this version was different - it had a strange aftertaste and wasn't as flavorful as sauces I've had at other restaurants in the area. Our entrees were served with a side of the restaurant's namesake; however the rice was very dry, almost as if it were stale. My entree was not heated through consistently and I seemed to alternate between steaming hot bites and lukewarm ones. We agreed that the soup was the best part of the meal. So, for the food I give it a 3 which could be bumped up to a 3.5 or 4 for the service, the ambiance, and the lemongrass soup."
8389,3889,4,1,2/9/2012,"We came here on a thursday night around 6 before an orchestra concert at the Kimmel Center. Most of the tables had reservation tags on them. Since there was only 3 tables taken at that time, we were seated. I wanted to hear Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg's preconcert talk at 7, so I wanted a place nearby. We did make it to the talk on time. (and she was worth hearing talk as well as play) I've uploaded a few photos. We had the green curry with chicken and ""the king and I"". The green curry is good. Two things to point out though. Whenever you see a menu where you can choose the meat - here you can add chicken, beef, shrimp, duck, salmon, seafood or none - you know that it has not been cooked in the curry. This chicken was not dry as is the usual case with such menus. The other thing that would have improved it is the addition of fresh kaffir lime leaves. Otherwise, the curry is better than the low end Maesri canned paste curries you find in mediocre Thai food places. The Kind and I came with shrimp and chicken. The sauce was Prik Khing - a gingery paste - without coconut milk like a curry. It tasted like the shrimp and chicken were cooked in the sauce. It was good. I've had Thai food all over the world, including Thailand. This place does not rank among the best. But locally it is among the best. The space is indeed small and the tables are close together. By the time we left (6:45 or so) it was fairly full. The crowd was mostly composed of concert goers. So, the too-cool-for-this-planet hipster crowd was not in evidence. If that is what you are seeking, then Monk's is only a block away."
8390,3889,3,1,2/6/2012,"Food is good. Much better than the average americanized Thai. They got a different twist on the food which makes it original yet authentic. As opposed to other reviews I actually enjoyed the Tom-Yum. It's different than any Tom-Yum I ate in Thailand but still good. I also tried the the Red Curry and some other entrees. All were good. Some very good. Never mind-blowing though. Now the reason I decided to give it 3 stars is because at the end of the day the food lacks in the bang-for-the-buck department. The portions always seem a little too small and more than a little expensive. For a soup and an entree you'll pay over $20 after taxes, and you're not very likely to have any leftovers. The rice container for the take-out was as small as I've ever seen in any other Asian restaurant I've ever gotten food from. I live close-by so I'll be back, but not nearly as often as I would like to, unless one of the following happens: the food gets exceptional, the prices drop or the portions get bigger. The restaurant needs to work on giving a more generous air and not feel just a tiny bit stingy."
8391,3889,2,1,2/3/2012,"Service is SLOW. Waitress was sleepy. Ignored my request for mild spices. Food arrived WAY too spicey. Wake up, waitress! Listen to me when I say ""MILD spice."""
5103,3889,4,1,1/28/2012,"The food here is solid, the service can be better, but if you can deal with minor delays in receiving your food then you won't have any issues. I've eaten at the restaurant three times and will definitely be returning often because its one block from my apartment. I typically get the curries when I order Thai. I've tried the red, green, and panang curry which are all excellent, The coconut base is not overpowering and is a balanced well with the spices. I typically order Thai spicy because I'm immune to spicy food, I love it. If you like Thai soups; tom yum or tom kha, I would go with the tom kha, The tom yum soup is really oily which its not supposed to be. I was super confused when there was a layer of oil on top of my soup. All in all a friendly place with good food, and another bonus... its BYOB"
8392,3889,3,1,1/28/2012,"Okay. If you are in the neighborhood and craving Thai, this will do for a Rittenhouse square price. And, I can't recommend the Tom Yum, small and too sweet. If you want real, awesome Thai for a way better price, head down to Circles in South Philly. Miles better food. Circles all the way!"
8393,3889,4,1,1/12/2012,"Center City has a dearth of good Thai food, but this place is the best I've eaten at so far. ˜The decor is bright, upscale and nice. ˜The service is good. ˜Most importantly, the food is tasty. ˜Philly has poor Thai food overall (except for Circles) but this place is by far the best in Center City. ˜It just opened a couple months ago so give it a try."
7532,3889,2,1,1/9/2012,"This is an all-around 2 star place in just about every way you can imagine. Absolutely nothing stands out about it except for the few things that I disliked. However, they are conveniently located RIGHT across my apartment. That is pretty cool and I was excited to see a Thai restaurant so close by, even though there are already quite a few Thai places in Center City. The fact that they set up shop in a nice little neighborhood is attractive, but I feel like the novelty of this place stops there. The inside looks pretty lively most of the time which is inviting but the decor and set-up is rather plain and almost cafeteria-like in nature with its ordinary red picnic-tables and somewhat bare walls that even display an elementary school style fire-bell on the wall. The tables have no place settings, no coasters and no glass top either, although they are polished well. Tables are somewhat close together but not so much so that it's annoying. The table all the way to the far back left corner however is poorly located right in front of the cash register. Not only do you get to hear ever other table being rang up while you sit there but if you're lucky you get to overhear some of the very unprofessional comments and discussion of the staff who think that no one can hear them. No matter how friendly they are to you and how well you're served, they lose a little of that customer-service friendliness when right after they say please/thank you, they walk two feet away from you and stand there swearing and making comments you'd hear on the street. Just because they aren't aimed at anyone in particular makes no difference, it's just plain rude and unprofessional. As for the food- it's what you would expect of a random place like this: It wasn't the best Thai food I've ever had and it wasn't the worst either. At this point it's so widely available I feel like any place that is just NOW opening a Thai restaurant needs to bring a little something extra to the table. Jasmine Rice doesn't really do that and that's why it's a cute but forgettable experience that I can't really recommend to anyone else."
8394,3889,3,1,1/9/2012,"I have to say I was a little disappointed at Jasmine Rice. My BF and I go to Smile Cafe way too often on Saturday night date nights so we were in the market for a new Thai place. On a recent visit my boyfriend informed me that Jasmine Rice had just opened and that it looked cute inside. OK he didn't exactly say that, but the interior designer definitely did a good job making this a cozy place. By the way, their bathroom is very clean which is always a plus. To start things off, we ordered our usual fav appetizer, Chao Phraya Express, which was a solid version of a summer roll. We tried Pad Khimao (Drunken Noodles) and Massaman Curry for our entrees. Boring I know, but we like to stick to the standard dishes when we're trying out a new restaurant. We both were impressed with the food here. BF said that the Pad Khimao was the best he's had yet in Philly. I thought the curry was tasty and spiced nicely. I was also impressed with the presentation. So why the 3 stars? I admit that I had gotten used to the cheap Thai restaurants in Chicago where you could get a great plate of Pad Thai for $7. Portions at Jasmine Rice are on the smaller side, and the prices are a little bit more than I like to spend on my student budget. Additionally, the place is kinda cramped--even for a small Asian like me. Tables are stacked right next to each other, and this made the dining experience a little uncomfortable. I guess I was hoping this would be the cheap, neighborhood Thai place. One where you could quickly stop by any day of the week and get a filling dinner. This is not that kind of place, but the food is still good."
7808,3889,5,1,12/29/2011,"My favorite Thai spot in Philly so far. ˜Too bad they don't deliver to my current address, but I'll be moving soon (primarily because of work, not food, I swear...) We started with the Crispy Spring Rolls, which were lightly friend and VERY hot (beware, eager eaters). ˜The Chicken Pad Thai had the perfect peanut-lime combination with tender meat. ˜The Beef Green Curry had a nice portion of vegetables to balance out the protein and a fantastic kick. And, it must be mentioned that the bathroom was kind of heavenly. ˜A heater warmed the spacious room, the scented candle smelled divine, and it was very clean...extra points!"
8395,3889,5,1,12/27/2011,update: i cannot tell you how much i love this place.
8396,3889,2,1,12/22/2011,"I recently dined-in at Jasmine Rice and it was so-so. The spring rolls were really tasty, but probably the best part of the night. I ordered the Pad Thai because it is one of my favorite dishes and a pretty good indicator of a good Thai restaurant. The dish was overly sweet and just not a good Pad Thai, with almost no sprouts and no peanuts-- I would not order this again. My boyfriend had the Crying Tiger salad which he thought was ok because it was spicy but a little on the vinegar-y side. The service was very good in this tiny place, with the server regularly checking on us and refilling our water. We'll probably return because of proximity to try a few more things, but not dying to go back."
8397,3889,5,1,12/21/2011,Pad thai was delicious and service was excellent =)
8398,3889,4,1,12/18/2011,"This is a great little place that is relatively new. Owned and operated by a married couple, you can tell it's a labor of love. I can understand the feedback about the wait times, and it's true, you can find yourself waiting for the food to come out because of their conscious decision to have one cook make each dish as its ordered. But this is the kind of place where you sit, chat and enjoy so I tend not to mind. I've had all of the noodle dishes--the vegetarian Pad See Ew takes the cake for me, but they're all delicious. The curries are equally tasty. For smaller plates, the thai meatballs and Isaan beef are my recommendations, both bursting with flavor. The service is always friendly and chances are you'll meet the owner wandering through as he chats up guests."
8399,3889,5,1,11/27/2011,"Fantastic experience with a group of six on Saturday night. Staff was great, food was fantastic! So affordable and delicious. A great addition to the neighborhood. We will be back!"
8400,3889,4,1,11/21/2011,The food is great and the staff is extremely nice. ˜I love all the fantastic vegetarian options and the fact that it's byob.
8401,3889,4,1,11/19/2011,"Mixed reviews for my new neighbor. ˜I have to say I am FAN because of the ridiculously close location and the fact that the few things I have ordered here have been deeeelicious. ˜ I am fully obsessed with the Pad Thai and the Pad See Ew both with tofu (and I am SO not a vegetarian in any way!). ˜I have also gotten the satay chicken and the Thai basil meatballs - both tasty with a nice amount of spice. ˜I had one disappointment in my several visits - Chao Phraya Express - and I won't blame them because I don't think I would have liked this appetizer no matter where I went. ˜ As mentioned, they are a bit on the slow side with service. ˜I don't know why I am not bothered by this as I normally would be but for some reason, I am not. ˜I get the sense that they don't have many people in the kitchen and they are making the entrees one at a time. ˜Maybe the best advice would be to bring your wine and settle in, knowing that you will have a bit of a wait but it will be worth it. ˜ FYI - they do takeout. ˜Its a dangerous thing especially when its just a few doors down!!"
8402,3889,2,1,11/13/2011,"My friends and I arrived here after an extended happy hour, excited to try the cute, tiny Thai place we had walked by a few times. ˜We had called about an hour before after seeing that reservations were a must, ESPECIALLY for our party of 6, and luckily they were able to give us a reservation 45 min later. ˜We arrived, plenty of wine in hand, and our table was ready - a great start. ˜ The place IS tiny, maybe seats about 20 in total, and they did a good job decorating the small space. ˜We placed our orders and settled in to our wine. ˜Slowly, we watched all the other tables be served their food.... people that arrived 20 minutes, 30 minutes after us. ˜When they finally started bringing our food, they brought out 1 or 2 plates at a time, with about 5 min in between sets. ˜I was the last person to get my plate, and everyone was mostly finished before I had my first bite - and that's only because they were being polite and eating slowly. ˜Even when asking about our food, no one apologized for the wait or explained anything, just said it would be out ""soon"". ˜ The food tasted good, but honestly by then we had imbibed 5 bottles of wine and I was starving, I would've eaten anything. ˜ I'll give it a try in a few months, but for now this was definitely a 2 star experience."
8403,3889,2,1,11/7/2011,"I really wanted to love this place. ˜The place is the former Warsaw Cafe location and is super cute on the inside and out. ˜The service was a bit slow, but the owner/waiter/food runner was extremely friendly. ˜The restaurant was relatively full but they only had 1 waitress and the owner who functioned as a waiter/food runner. ˜I heard the owner telling someone that his wife makes all the food and she only makes one dish at a time...which doesn't seem like the best idea. ˜This may also explain why the food didn't come out piping hot. Appetizers: Fried tofu- good, but could have been crispier. ˜Thai papaya salad was pretty good as were the thai basil meatlballs, but I felt like it could have used some kind of dipping sauce or something since they were a bit dry. Entrees: Pad Thai- super super al dente. ˜Some of the noodles were basically uncooked and the pad thai was a bit dry. ˜My friend got the panaeng curry with duck which was actually delicious. ˜ I will probably give this place another try. ˜It is relatively new so perhaps they need some time to work out some things."
8404,3889,4,1,10/26/2011,"Looks like other yelpers have found this place to be hit or miss. ˜For me it was mainly a hit, but it's clear that they're still working out the kinks. ˜My friends and I made reservations (a must since this place, as others indicated, is a teeny-tiny space) and when we arrived they bizarrely decided to seat us at two tables pulled together...and then leave another 2-seater against the wall on our other side. ˜It was poor planning on their part since nobody could sit at that table (it would have been impossible to get in there) and they ended up turning away interested patrons. ˜I digress... Crispy tofu appetizer was okay, and yes, the service was s-l-o-w so best not to come here if you're on your way to something else, BUT the entrees were delicious. ˜The spice is legitimate *spice* so it's not for the faint of heart. ˜Oddly, my pad see ew came out with pad thai noodles...I kinda had my heart set on the bigger noodles but I quickly got over it. ˜ The servers were nice and apologetic when they saw us wondering about our other entrees. ˜My friend loved her lemongrass soup and tried to ""save"" a bit of it to take home. ˜Our server actually filled up another bowl for her to take with her (no charge)...how nice is that? ˜ Give Jasmine Rice a shot, but it's best to go in with an open mind and some time to kill."
8405,3889,2,1,10/14/2011,"Make sure to make reservations before showing up. The restaurant is small and only seats about 30 people total. Because they try to get as many people in as possible, it's a tight fit and also LOUD. It seems like the kitchen is too small for the volume or people, or maybe the place is too new to have worked out a good system for large parties. To their credit, they fit us in when a party of four was late for their reservation and the spring rolls and entrees were pretty good. Also, they were diligent about refilling water glasses and had very friendly staff. I'd go back, but probably for take-out only."
8406,3889,5,1,10/6/2011,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE Jasmine Rice! The layout is slightly better than Sawatdee on South Street, but still tight. I was happy to see that they were busy though since they've just recently opened. The food is incredible! I cannot pronounce what I had, but it was spicy and delicious. Everything is delicious. My husband had the Pad Thai and it was citrusy which was interesting. The waitress asked if it was our first time, we said it was and she said ""It won't be your last..."" at the time I thought that was rather presumptuous of her, but damn, she was right! I can't wait to go back!!"
8407,3889,2,1,10/2/2011,My sister and I decided to have dinner here last Friday. We definitely had high hopes! We left pretty disappointed... Service is super slow and inattentive. Food is not bad- when they get it right. They completely messed up our whole order. I expected more...too bad...maybe carry out next time (shrugs)
8408,3889,2,1,10/2/2011,"I'll start by saying we went on a Friday night around 7:15pm, arguably the busiest time of the night. Luckily it was just 2 of us so we got a seat right away, the place was completely full at that point. First person to greet us is the chef, which is a nice surprise, but as time goes on we realize it's just because his waitress staff is very busy. Menu looks great, we order Salt and Pepper Shrimp Rolls, the King and I and Jatujak Stir Fried Shrimp. Salt and Pepper Spring Rolls came out fast. They were honestly just ok, they had mushroom in them, which wasn't listed as an ingredient, but the taste was very sub-par. Didn't really fit the flavor profile of salt and pepper shrimp with cilantro. The citrus lime dipping sauce was just thinned out duck sauce. By the time we finished that we had both drank our glass of water and for the next 45 minutes we were ignored, no refill of water, no food, not even a look. Again I know they were busy, but when they would sit a table near us, they would bring them water and not even glance at our table. Ok, 45 minutes after the appetizer, dinner comes. I'm eating the King and I which is basically Pad Prik King, string beans are undercooked which is actually how I like them in my Pad Prik King, very crunchy. But they taste dirty and the sauce doesn't seem like it was cooked with the food, just poured over at the very end. I like the flavors somewhat marinated with the protein and vegetables. Girlfriend is eating the Jatujak, which said it was spicy, but wow it really is hot. Hotter then the 10 at Han Dynasty in Old City. I have a pretty high tolerance for spice so we switch plates. I get to a shrimp in the Jatujak that is right on the line of undercooked. I figured with the temperature hotness of the food it is probably fine, dumb mistake. The next day I was writhing in stomach pain. Like I said before, they were busy, the chef even had to come out to help a little (which is an admirable trait for someone in the kitchen), but ignoring a table for 45 minutes when all they wanted was some more water (yes we did ask) and then serving undercooked seafood due to the pressure of getting the food out is inexcusable. On paper the food looked amazing, but on my plate and in my stomach it disappointed. There is plenty of other delicious Thai Food in that area the I will stick with."
8409,3889,5,1,10/2/2011,"So far, the best Thai food in Center City. This is what I've been searching for, for all this time! I went in their second week of being open on a Friday night at prime dinner time. The small restaurant was packed but we managed to get their very last table for 4. The servers were Thai girls who you could tell were not super experienced servers but they were very attentive and friendly. I saw the owner a number of times training them throughout the ˜night on how he'd like the plates presented and how he'd like the service to go. We got our appetizers in a timely manner and they were all delicious: -Curry Chicken Wings with a sweet chili sauce - very tasty -Tom Kha vegetarian - the BEST. Very authentic, full of all those wonderful Thai flavors that I love so much. We waited a while for our dinner, so much so that at some point we noticed how long it was taking. I honestly am the type of person who will completely forgive this in a restaurant who is in their second week of business. Not only that, but the Chef/Owner came out at the end of the night and apologized for the wait and made sure everyone was ok. Entrees were all spectacular. We got: - Massaman Curry w/Chicken - Crispy duck Fried Rice - Pad Khimao - Pad See Ew All of which were excellent, big portions, and we all were extremely satisfied. Four clean plates! As I mentioned, the chef came out to talk to us after our meal. He was such a nice man. He told us that it is just him and his wife cooking in the small kitchen. And you can totally tell but how much love they put into this food. It's just straight up fresh, home cooked Thai food. It definitely has the mom and pop feel to it. This place is only a couple of blocks farther away from my home than some other Thai restaurants in the area, but I am SURE to come back to this place many many times in the future."
8410,3889,4,1,9/26/2011,"We saw that Jasmine Rice had opened up on Spruce and 16th. ˜We were excited to try out a new Thai restaurant so we headed out for a nice weeknight dinner...

8411,10,1,0,10/25/2014,"I tried this place twice. The first experience was great, I ordered the jerk chicken. The steamed cabbage and rice was amazing and so was the taste of the chicken, it was flavorful. Two days ago I came back, to try other stuff on the menu. I ordered large order of oxtails. First of, the portion of the oxtail was less than I expected. Probably four to fives very small pieces. Really? That's what you consider a large? And it was 16 dollars. Ridiculous. The small oxtails wasn't ˜very flavorful..It taste like sh**!!! The steam cabbage tasted awful!! It was sour and dual. I had to give it to the dog be it was basically dog food.

8414,10,1,0,6/11/2011,My husband and i were excited to try this food but when we called they only had enough chicken for one wrap. no pork and no plantains!!! How do you run a business (with a very small menu) and not even have any food!!! unexceptable. Will never TRY and order from there again. There's better places in new haven.
8415,10,1,0,9/28/2010,"Poor service! ˜ One day I placed my order which was Oxtail and rice-n-pies, they were out of rice-n-pies so ask if i could buy an order of oxtail instead, the owner rolled her eyes and said it would cost you $12 for three pieces (thats the same price for the meal, which include rice and vegetable). ˜I've been served cold food on two separate occasion, the prices on there food items went up within months of the restaurant opening. ˜It seems like as business got better they raised the prices, in my opinion the food items are over priced."

Overall not good value for money."
8421,10,4,1,1/4/2014,"We just returned from a Caribbean vacation, and had a hankering for some island taste. We were not disappointed. We just enjoyed a takeout dinner of jerk chicken, cole slaw and peas and rice. The chicken was tender, very spicy but with the pleasing depth characteristic of good jerk cooking that combines thyme, peppers with a hint of allspice. The peas and rice were excellent (I think I detected a touch of coconut milk) and not greasy at all, making it even better than the versions we were served while we were on vacation. The cole slaw was crisp (without sugar, happily) if a touch oversalted. I ordered a medium portion which had a generous three pieces of chicken, while the small was more than enough for my wife. Don't let the modest storefront fool you; the food is authentic and very tasty, and the service very friendly. I look forward to returning soon. There are Jamaican soft drinks in the cooler and the service is cafeteria style."
8422,10,4,1,10/13/2013,Large jerk chicken and rice is 10 bucks out the door. The chicken is deliciously spicy and tender. The rice has an insane amount of flavor as well. I really can't say anything else. The people are friendly and the food is great.
8423,10,3,1,3/2/2013,"The food is okay. The curry chicken was too salty, and the cabbage was sour. I recommend Kingston Cafe in Stratford instead. I only come up tropical breeze because it's closer to my home"
8424,10,4,1,1/29/2013,"A while back I was enjoying a day with my mom and we ended up getting a quick lunch here. Only tried the Jamaican Beef Patties. I can't speak for how authentic the food actually is, but those patties were really good! Flavorful, a little spice but not too much. The restaurant was nice and clean. ˜ Food took about 10 minutes, but that's pretty fast for something hot and freshly made. Last I was there they also had a nice variety of glass bottle sodas and some tropical juices to pick from. I'd go again if I'm down by Campbell street for some reason. Reasonably priced ˜too!"
8425,10,4,1,1/12/2013,"I have passed this location on Campbell Ave a few times. ˜I finally decided it was time to try it. ˜I said if I'm going to have some Jamaican food, I'm going for a traditional dish.. Curry Goat! A medium is a enough for two. ˜The goat was so tender and flavored down to the bone. ˜It was nicely spiced. ˜The rice & peas were fluffy & delicious also. ˜It's a nice location with sit down capability. ˜Nice & clean. ˜The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because I want to try the jerk chicken wrap first but overall this place is great! ˜I have my selection when it comes to Jamaican restaurants in New Haven. ˜They are everywhere. ˜But I will travel to West Haven from now on. ˜It's that good."
8426,10,5,1,9/20/2012,"SECOND LOCATION NOW OPEN - in Bridgeport, CT on Main St. I happened upon this restaurant on Main St. in Bridgeport purely by chance while driving by. ˜They aren't even showing up in Google, Yelp or Apple iPhone maps yet, but just type in the address and you'll find it: ˜ ˜ Tropical Breeze Jamaican Kitchen ˜ ˜ 3896 Main Street ˜ ˜ Bridgeport, CT ˜06606 ˜ ˜ Phone: ˜203-372-0441 ˜ ˜ They also offer carry-out, catering and DELIVERY in the nearby area. ˜Order this for your next office lunch and your happy stomach will make for a blissful afternoon. Overall Impression: ˜New, clean, small, bright and friendly with GREAT FOOD. ˜Carryout, delivery, and dine-in options (only two tables for dine-in, though, so more of a carryout place). ˜Super friendly counter girl (Erica) and nice selection of soda and juices as well, including Coconut Water. Food: ˜Excellent! ˜They have a great menu with all of the classic Jamaican dishes you would hope to see: ˜Patties, Jerk Chicken & Jerk Pork, Brown Stew Chicken, Curried Goat, Oxtail, Salt Fish, Escoveitch Fish, Plantains, Yams, Rice and Peas, and Cabbage. ˜I'll try to post a photo of their menu here if I can. ˜ I tried a sampling of Jerk Chicken, Brown Stew Chicken and Oxtail. ˜(Thanks, Erica for doing this ""custom"" lunch dish for me!) ˜All were flavorful, fall-off-the-bone tender, cooked and seasoned well. ˜Definitely a must-return. ˜ I've eaten at many Jamaican restaurants that had fabulous food but weren't clean or well managed, and as a result ended up going out of business. ˜This place is absolutely an exception. ˜Nice and clean, with great food and great service. Atmosphere: ˜This isn't a fancy coat and tie affair, but could be great for a first date or a quick stop in for lunch or dinner. ˜Bright, airy colors and Caribbean music playing help get you in the mood for some tasty island flavor. Parking: ˜Street parking only. ˜There is a small parking lot next to the restaurant, but per the signs it is apparently not for the restaurant patrons. ˜You might get towed from that lot, so just park on the street as close as you can... it's worth the walk. My recommendation: ˜Eat here often! ˜Keep this fabulous restaurant busy to keep a delicious Jamaican restaurant open and accessible in Bridgeport!"
8427,10,4,1,1/20/2012,Had lunch there. Small place. Essentially counter service. I had the goat stew which was good. Wife had a Jamaican beef patty which was great. Definitely will go back.
8428,10,3,1,9/4/2011,"I love the Thai coconut juice with pulp in cans. I will definitely stock up on it here. I had the jerk chicken wrap, which had some pieces of cartilage. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked. Their vegetable empanada was just right.. some spice, fresh, and filling. I will try the spicy patty, plantains and rice and peas next. This restaurant is located across from the Bank of America, with ample street parking."
8429,10,4,1,5/8/2011,"I had their jerk chicken wrap and CAN'T WAIT to go back again and try something else. They had a newspaper critique on their wall and was very impressed with their review. I had their fried plantains and I thought I had died and gone to the Caribbean. I cannot wait until I go back again. Though the place is slightly small and plain, It's ideal for takeout."
8430,10,5,1,9/30/2010,"Yes tropical breeze, yes. Let's talk about West Haven, CT. This is not the kind of place that screams tropical paradise. Don't get me wrong, I have no problems West Haven; it's really your average blue collar I-95 corridor kind of place. You know, a dive bar, a Bank of America, a ""package store"" as they like to call them up New England way, and a town green. Enter tropical breeze (interpret the syntax of that however you please). This is a world away. I mean, Bob Marley on the radio, bright yellow walls, and smells that are I can only describe as Irie. Also a lot of large photos of beaches. If this sounds at all sardonic, let me be very clear, I am a huge fan of Tropical Breeze, and I would just as soon drive a flaming motorcycle off the Fort Weatherill Cliffs and into the Naragansett Bay than say anything mocking about Tropical Breeze. Walk in there on a cold winter day, and you'll see that I'm not kidding. I can say with total sincerity that Tropical Breeze is a small slice of paradise on the streets of Gotham. The food here is good, and it's the real deal. They sell Ting, so you know it's authentic. The service is solid. It's really cheap. Go there."
5168,10,5,1,10/14/2009,"I can't say enough good things about this tiny place. ˜It has served as a good alternative to my usual lunch selections for the last month. ˜So far I've tried their jerk chicken wrap, spicy Jamaican meat patty, brown chicken stew, curry chicken, ox tail stew, dumplings, and plaintains. ˜They've all been excellent (and slightly spicy). ˜Cole slaw or dirty rice will usually accompany each item. ˜For the full island experience, grab a can of Grace coconut water. ˜It's great stuff, even with the pulp. The inside, while neat and clean, consists of a counter and a few tables. ˜I'll usually grab my lunch to go. ˜ Prices are reasonable with lunch usually coming in under $8. ˜Jamaican wraps and ""small"" entrees cost about $6 each. ˜ Verdict: ˜good affordable spicy food with a dash of international flair. ˜I give it a thumbs up or as they say in Jamaica, ""Yeah Mon!"""
8431,12,1,0,12/29/2014,"Had a Spinsaver coupon for Piccolo Trattorio in Newtown so I took the whole family there for a quiet Friday late lunch the day after Christmas. The restaurant had only a few patrons. When it came time to use my spinsaver coupon, the server pointed out the fine print that states it's only good for a Sunday-Thursday. I didn't see that on the Spinsaver before I bought or I wouldn't have purchased it-shame on me. But when I spoke to the manager to attempt to work things out, the only thing he would do was give me face value for the ""next time"" I eat in. Since there was nothing they were able to do, I certainly will not come in a ""next time"". Seems that if you're doing extra marketing to bring in extra business, they could've worked with us to make us happy ""this time""."
8432,12,1,0,12/30/2013,"Went here 2 or 3 times and dined in. Food was okay. Atmosphere was stuffy (for a strip mall) and not very friendly. We returned because it was fairly close and I liked the food back when I went to TCNJ. The other night we ordered take-out. I couldn't bite my chicken sandwich because it was tough. I tried the other half and had same issue. I opened up the sandwich and realized the chicken was raw, which is why I couldn't chew it. It was totally pink. Disgusted. We called and let them know. We drove 15 minutes to go back to restaurant (on Xmas Eve), and the man behind the counter asked what was wrong- when we said chicken was raw, he offered no apology at all. We were giving them the benefit of the doubt, but after going back and getting no apology or even acknowledging that serving raw chicken is unacceptable, we will never go back. How do you not apologize for failing to serve edible food, especially after someone has to drive back to your restaurant? Foolish."
8433,12,1,0,5/17/2013,"Graduation Disaster! Last night was the worst experience my family and I have ever experienced at a restaurant. ˜My daughter graduated with from the College of New Jersey. ˜She wanted to go to her favorite Italian restaurant near the college, Piccolo's in Pennington. ˜I had made the reservations for 8PM almost 2 months. ˜So when we arrived there was a crowd waiting to get in. ˜When we approached the hostess they said there would be a wait. ˜They were seating people who had reservations from 6PM who did not arrive until 7:30-8PM. ˜They had obviously overbooked because of the graduation. ˜Several groups left because of the extended wait. ˜We eventually did get seated around 8:50PM. ˜Frustrated and upset we were finally tried to enjoy the evening. ˜We did not have a waitress stop by or drop off menus for at least 15 minutes. ˜Ordered an appetizer and all the dinners around 9:10PM. ˜Of course the prices were an average of $4 more than the normal menu. ˜Waited patiently for the main courses, asked the waitress several times for our meals, mentioned that we had grandparents who lived an 1 1/2 hours away and a brother who had to catch a train for NYC by 11:07PM. ˜Finally talked to a manager who was here from the Newtown store. ˜Told him we had to leave and we wanted the check. ˜He was very apologetic and asked us to wait. ˜All of a sudden the food came out at almost 10:30PM. ˜We were getting up to leave and the Newtown manager said that the entrees would be taken off the bill. ˜The he came back and asked for my name and phone number. ˜He handed me an envelope with a $40 coupon instead of reducing the bill. ˜He said he would call today and what a surprise no call. Piccolo's has been in the area long enough to know what happens on graduation night but they are more concerned with making money then supporting the college communities that have supported them for years. ˜The $40 coupon has been thrown into the garbage. ˜I will never set foot in any of the 3 Piccolo restaurants in the area. Thank you for ruining a great day."
8434,12,1,0,3/21/2013,"I like their Brooklyn pizza , so I used go there some times for that. One day I gave them 20$ bill to get two slices of Brooklyn, got less change back. Guy in the counter with think accent said , ""my friend you gave 10$ bill, I can check in camera"". I said go for it. This guy was very rude and accused me, instead of saying sorry to me. ˜I am sure if there was an American in the counter he/she would have said sorry or It wouldn't have happened since we announce louder like ""$7 out of $20"", that's good practice. ˜After that he delayed my food purposely ˜for just 2 slices to worm up. After waiting for 8 mins , I noticed people who came way after me getting their slices . So went back to counter asked for my food, he got so mad, and said ""My friend, you will get your food ok!, you have to wait"" . I felt so insulted in front of other customers at the counter, since then decided to not go there ever. ˜I like their food though"
8435,12,1,0,6/8/2012,"Mediocre food, inattentive wait staff, ˜generally unorganized. ˜I went with group of 8 for lunch and one person's food came 20 minutes after everyone else's. ˜The staff didn't seem to care and gave no explanation and weren't apologetic."
8436,12,1,0,7/9/2011,"Worst pizza I've eaten in Mercer County. There are simply many other options within walking distance of this rotting, festering, culinary abortion to choose this place. If you want terrible service and awful food, by all means, go here"
8437,12,2,0,9/20/2010,"i had to post on here to be absolutely grumpy. i have TRIED so hard to like this place, many of my friends rave about it and I try and try and am disappointed everytime. The pastas are all so heavy and the sauces are not very good, the house dressing everyone raves about in my opinion is way too sweet. the things ive had there that ive enjoyed are only moderate at best. definitely not worth their jacked up prices. sometimes i think if you bring people into a dimly lit place and give them a napkin to put on their lap they feel like its fancy and theyre obligated to like it. to me this place has never lived up to its hype i just dont get it."
8438,12,3,0,10/8/2012,"This is a perfectly acceptable Italian restaurant with a wide variety of menu options. The food is fine and you can expect to always get food that is fine. I particularly enjoy the pappardella montrachet. ˜The specials range more into exceptional - but they are also priced as exceptional. (The specials generally revolve around seafood.) The dining room is spacious and well kept; sometimes a bit noisy. Service is generally friendly and efficient. This is a BYOB. The pizza parlor is generally pretty busy and we have had both good and bad luck with pies to go. We have decided Friday night is NOT the night to order out pizza, but Saturday has been fine. Not sure if that is a staff or volume issue, but this is our observation."
8439,12,4,0,3/13/2013,The food is so good here. My favorite grilled chicken Caesar salad is THE BEST.
8440,12,4,0,10/13/2012,This place had more options for slices of pizza then I could even handle. You basically could name any food and they had it as a pizza topping. I went with the buffalo chicken slice even though it had blue cheese on it. I hate blue cheese but this slice was really good. I also had the grandma slice which is a thin square slice. Very good as well.
8441,12,4,0,2/18/2012,"Been to Piccolo's ˜a handful of times since I began working in the area. I've come for dinner with friends, family, co workers...I'd dine with strangers. Get my point?? BYOB - A great bonus to the experience. (A liquor store is located next ˜door!) Food- Very dependable, I know I'm going to have a delicious italian meal every time. Tastes like it's homemade every time. The gnocchi float off of your plate :) Atmosphere- I only dine from late spring to early fall so I can dine outside. The outside dining is very relaxing and comfortable. The inside set-up is very tight squeezed. I don't feel as if I can have a private conversation. ˜This is why I didn't give 5 stars. Staff- The wait staff is a 50/50 chance. There are some waiters who are so cordial and inviting and a few of them are so so grumpy. I just try to ignore it because the food is so good. This is another reason why I did not give 5 stars. Bathrooms - (I always rate as they are a direct link to the cleanliness of the overall location.) Very clean and nicely decorated."
8442,12,4,0,12/3/2011,"Best italian food in Pennington, for sure. ˜The food is almost always very good. ˜Service is hit or miss, but usually better than not. BYOB. ˜Good take out service, if you can handle waiting in a crowd."
8443,12,5,0,8/17/2014,"The pizza here is amazing and the pasta pizza is one of my favorites. The staff is very welcoming and the two workers behind the counter, Matt and Brian, were very helpful with recommending the best slices and with checkout. Highly recommend."
8444,12,5,0,6/23/2014,Great pizza.
8445,12,5,0,7/2/2013,"I've managed to get myself to come here only once a week, because it is so gosh-darn good I can't help myself! ˜I really hope that Palermo's and Piccolo Trattoria have a pizza-contest, because it would be a really close match. ˜Piccolo Trattoria also has amazing pannini sandwiches. ˜Always fresh and amazing. ˜Great bread. ˜But really delicious pizza slices."
8446,12,5,0,7/31/2011,Great food
8447,12,5,0,7/5/2011,Great Italian food
8448,12,5,0,9/1/2010,Antipasto and the Brooklyn pizza. 'Nuff Said
8449,12,4,1,1/4/2015,"I freely admit I'm probably biased. ˜I tried *real* Spaghetti alla Carbonara for the first time here. ˜For that introduction alone I can forgive a multitude of sins. They have a really large menu, covering standard Italian fare, so it's pretty much guaranteed you can find SOMEthing to tempt you. ˜It's BYO, which is fine and fairly standard M.O. in the area. I've been here for both large (50+ attendees) events and small (3 person) dinners, and every time it's been good. ˜They have a great patio if you want to host a larger gathering. ˜Good waitstaff, very attentive without hovering. Hey Mikey! ˜I like it!"
8450,12,4,1,12/26/2014,One of the best pizza places around. Great choice for anyone looking for real traditional great pizza taste.
8451,12,2,1,11/15/2014,"I would rate the actual restaurant with 1 star, but the pizza/takeout side with 4 stars. First the take-out: We have ordered from here a bunch of times. The paninis are delicious (get the honey mustard chicken!) and the pizza is pretty tasty as well. Those are definitely their strong points. The restaurant: We've only been here once, and needless to say, will not be returning.We had french onion soup as an appetizer - pretty bland. ˜I had the chicken fettuccine alfredo and my husband had chicken parmigiana for entrees. They both were complete tasteless with absolutely no flavor. I actually think the the Olive Garden would probably serve tastier ""italian food"" than this place! The chicken in my fettuccine alfredo was so weird - it tasted like absolutely nothing. We did have dessert and that was delicious. If you are looking for a good italian place, head down the road to Metro Grill in Ewing."
8452,12,3,1,10/29/2014,Decided on Piccolo Trattoria on a Friday night with my husband and daughter. We had been once before for a party and remember it being good. We were a bit disappointed with our meal on this occasion. I chose the sausage and broccoli rabe and it was just average. My husband ordered whole wheat penne pasta with sausage and meatballs in a fra diablo sauce and it was so spicy he couldn't taste anything else. My daughter enjoyed her house salad with grilled chicken. ˜ The staff was pleasant and attentive and the atmosphere is pleasant. If we go back it will be for their pizza which we've had and enjoyed in the past.
8453,12,1,1,10/20/2014,There is nothing redeeming about this place. Overpriced for what it is. Horrendous service. What else do you need to know. There is about as much effort put into this restaurant as Russell Crowe put into Robin Hood. Do yourself and favor and head off to somewhere else. Anywhere else.
8454,12,4,1,10/17/2014,Very impressed. I had a few hours to kill near the Trenton airport. Tried this place and dined solo in the formal dining part. Service was polite and prompt. They were just as courteous to a single gal as to a large party. I ordered a Veal dish served over gnocchi- amazing! The gnocchi are homemade and soft. The sauce had such good flavor. The veal was ok but the rest of the dish was so good I'd consider flying back to Trenton for it. It's. BYOB and there is conveniently a liquor store in the same complex.
8455,12,4,1,10/15/2014,"Consistent quality, a broad selection of Italian favorites and good service. It is a go to for many who work nearby. Their salads are particularly good. I have to say the pizzas are great as well."
8456,12,4,1,9/22/2014,"Delightful variety on the menu, creative dishes and specials, willing to go off-menu for special requests, very customer-centered service... I could go on. It's too bad that we have to drive an hour or so to go there, but it is worth an occasional trip. I have to deduct a star because it's a BYOB."
8457,12,2,1,9/20/2014,As usual the service is horrible. Took half hour to get pizzas when the restaurant isn't crowded Food ok but only get take out never sitting down in here again
8458,12,1,1,9/13/2014,"Ugh....came with a group of 24 and this place fell down flat. Got there and waited for wine glasses (with a reservation for 24 it would have been nice if the tables we set)....they didn't seem to have room for all of us, the table was set up in a weird U so it was hard to talk to people.(it would have been better if they didn't take the reservation at all if they couldn't accommodate)..the lighting was very bad - really felt like we were stuffed in the back of a pizzaria...which I guess we were. Before our entire party arrived 2 different waiters pushed for us to order a ""family style"" appetizer...when one person ordered it they served it for the entire group of 24...when about 8-10 people hadn't even arrived yet! It was also all seafood which was an inappropriate suggestion for a large group...and for as hard as they pushed it was not very good at all...mostly calamari and soggy breaded shrimp...and really awful clams casino. The appetizer was so bad that I decided not to order a fish dish and went for a chicken option - which was OK, but the poor service continued - I left dinner with friend feeling stressed and dissatisfied...and that was after a bottle of wine! I actually went home and ate. Maybe this place is ok if you are getting pizza, but they should try to be a fine dining resturant...because they are not. Out of all the great Italian restaurants in New Jersey I am not sure how this one should stay in business -"
8459,12,4,1,8/31/2014,Go to Piccolo's for the pizza not the pasta. Reasonably priced for the regular or special slices. Buffalo chicken and their white pies are some of the best choices. Other choices are alright-- went there once and the pasta was drenched in oil for the most part.
8460,12,3,1,8/17/2014,"Meh. The food was alright. I wasn't blown away with any of the dishes that I had there. I recognize that this is a pretty short review, but probably because it wasn't a very memorable visit."
8461,12,4,1,8/12/2014,"PIZZA ONLY I always get the Margherita slice. ˜thin crispy crust, fresh mozz & tomato topping. I miss this pizza dearly. apparently BYOB!"
8462,12,1,1,7/26/2014,Sorry but go to the olive garden instead of this place!! It got 1 star because the server was very nice and we felt bad that she had to serve us poor quality food. My guess clams cassino which was really a baked stuffed clam came out of a frozen box. I ordered chicken parmigiano just to play it safe and again that was probably a frozen breaded cutlet. ˜ They probably do boil the pasta but that's it. Everyone at the table ordered different items and came to the same conclusion. ˜ As another review the menu list is huge and that should have been a warning.
8463,12,4,1,7/19/2014,"great spot to bring your own wine, with a reasonably priced menu full of standard selections and some great specials. A great spot if you live in Central Jersey and are meeting people from the Philly area as its right in between!"
8464,12,5,1,6/10/2014,"I drive past 4 pizza places to go here. Best Brooklyn pie hands down, great chicken Caesar salad and ˜my son can't live without their vodka rigatoni pizza. We've been going here since it opened. Your best bet is to call in your order and it will be ready when you get there."
8465,12,5,1,6/9/2014,I've only been here once but boy was it good. I had pasta with shrimp and scallops on a pink sauce that was done to perfection. ˜I really enjoyed that I could barely understand our waiter because of his thick Italian accent. Real authentic even down to the people they hire.
8466,12,5,1,6/6/2014,"Was in the pennington area as I stumbled upon Piccolo via Google Reviews. ˜I ordered the Brooklyn Pizza. ˜At first I was skeptical as I work in NYC. however, the BK pizza was as good, if not better than the Brooklyn pies. ˜I also enjoyed a filet mignon as they had a special that day as it was scrumptious. ˜I highly recommend to anyone in the area and worth the trip from afar."
8467,12,2,1,5/28/2014,"I was disappointed with my lunch at Piccolo Trattoria. I ordered an eggplant parmigiana sandwich and I didn't love the way it tasted. ˜The sauce was too sweet for my liking, the eggplant was soft and mushy and the cheese was just barely hanging onto it. When it was served to me, the sandwich did not look very appetizing from the above description. ˜I decided to give it a shot anyway because I had hoped where it failed in presentation it would succeed in flavor. ˜Unfortunately it didn't. ˜It wasn't inedible, I just really feel that they could have done better. The free Wi-Fi was quite nice."
8468,12,2,1,5/20/2014,"I honestly don't know what all the hoopla about this place is. I really was hopefully going here, and although I don't think I'll be returning- I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because part of me is just a little in denial. I was really disappointed with just about everything here. I'll try to make the short and sweet. The menu: It was pretty big; I guess the first sign that the food may not be the most quality. Waitress: Classic Italian Momma type, sweet but no patience. Not awful service, but not the most professional. Atmosphere: It was actually kind of adorable in there! There was also a really cute outside seating area which faced the quiet side of the restaurant but unfortunately it was raining the night we went. ˜ Bread: Warm, but stale rolls. There was some type of red pepper sauce to dip it in, which made it edible. Appetizer: ˜We got the sample with calamari, clams casino, fried mozzarella and coconut shrimp. ˜Coconut shrimp at a 'nice' Italian place? Okay, whatever. Although everything was tasty, they were obviously frozen appetizers, or pre-made at best. The calamari was super chewy and we didn't even finish it all. Food: I ordered ˜a special, some type of 'Seafood Manicotti' with spinach on the side. Sounded interesting and I love my seafood. Oh lord. Just by the looks of it I new it wouldn't be appetizing. The manicotti pasta was chewy, with a weird coloring to it. It was 'stuffed' with this weird yellow thing.... sauce? I can't explain it. The crabmeat inside looked fresh, but the shrimp and scallops were super tiny, a sign to me that they were either frozen or from a can. I wish I would have taken a picture. The flavor overall wasn't great- the smell actually made me a little sick. But the spinach was delicious! ˜My BF got the Chicken Mimosa and he seemed pleased with it; but ended up taking most of it home. Price: Expensive! $19 for the sampler appetizer!! One plus, is that it was BYOB. To be honest; I will not be going back. Reading some of these reviews over I see that it may have the potential to redeem itself; but there are just so many other places out there that deserve a first shot before giving here another chance."
8469,12,5,1,5/12/2014,Our new Italian hangout We meet Moe the friendly general manager who recommended the Brooklyn pie. THe manager Moe let us know it takes 25 minutes and is made to order so be patient. The bread and marinated dipping sauce let us know we were into a good start. Bathroom was clean another good sign. We started with a portabella mushroom stuffed with delicious crabmeat roasted pepper garlic cheese and white white creamy sauce delicious. We also tried the eggplant parm as appetizer. Authentic Italian flavor. not fried with awesome marinara sauce. Kim was our attentive server and you should try this place. Friendly clean and delicious
8470,12,4,1,5/11/2014,I enjoyed my mother's day dinner. We ate our meal outside which was very enjoyable. Everyone enjoyed their meal. We are not from the area which is the only reason we won't be back. I do recommend this restaurant however they are a little pricier then I expected. This is a BYOB.
8471,12,4,1,5/11/2014,"Just had mother's day brunch here and it was yummy! ˜We tried most items between the 3 of us (eggs Benedict, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, French toast, blintzes, home fries, penne vodka, Lobster ravioli, assorted fruits and veggies, donuts, cannoli, so many cakes). ˜We didn't have any of the fish, chicken, beef, or ham dishes. ˜No particular reason, just went for the other stuff. ˜ Almost everything was great. ˜The pancakes, French toast and waffles, while delicious, were cold and didn't feel super fresh. ˜Everything else was perfect. Highlights were the home fries, the pastas, the orange juice, the donuts, and the cheesecake. I would absolutely recommend and go again."
8472,12,3,1,4/22/2014,"I came in looking to enjoy a nice solitary lunch. Sometimes when your surrounded by craziness at work, you just need a nice quiet lunch. I walked into this restaurant that seemed to be brimming with business lunches and the occasional elderly mother daughter duos. At least 4 employees must have asked if I was with someone or was someone enjoying me. ˜My little confidence of enjoying solitude was suddenly hampered by this sudden need for having a person around me. I ordered the lunch pasta ravioli milano. ˜First came the bread which is a bit too chewy for my taste but I was too hungry to care. Then the salad which wasn't good! The lettuce was wilted and the dressing was way too sweet then usual balsamic vinaigrette. To my surprise, the ravioli really triumphed all. The sauce was robust, rich and the right amount of creaminess. The raviolis were pillow soft and shrimp was just perfect. I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't offered a dessert menu but I guess perhaps next time....."
8473,12,4,1,4/9/2014,"I was visiting friends in the area and we all decided to come here since hearing how great Piccolo's pizza is. Living in the NYC area and having access to legendary pizza, I was not convinced. We ordered Brooklyn and plain pies. Pizza came out delicious! You can taste the ingredients used were top notch. The crust was thin and crispy with fresh cheese. I was surprised that you can actually get this type of pizza in South Jersey. The place is clean and has a great family atmosphere. You can tell that the staff and the owners do care about their customers and business. Will be coming back to Piccolo Trattoria next time I am in the area."
8474,12,4,1,3/18/2014,"Solid solid food... solid service... and seemingly endless portions. The food is so good, even though you squeaked at the notion of eating it all... you somehow manage... and then regret it, not because it was bad, but because now you have no room for desert... and their deserts are good too. We used to frequent this place quite a bit, but somehow it's fallen off our radar, we'll be back soon."
8475,12,4,1,2/17/2014,We have gone here numerous times for pizza and finally sat in the dinning room for a dinner. We were not disappointed. ˜We had the chicken francaise (sp?) and chicken Parmesan . ˜Food was good and liked that is is byob. Better than most local places. Will go again.
8476,12,4,1,11/18/2013,"I heart this place for pizza and can't speak for its dinner/other food options. Definitely specialty styled which sets it apart from other pizza options in the area. I always used to run in for two slices (which is serious because one fills me up). Kinda expensive for a slice but the toppings are insane, so it's okay. Only thing I can say is it gets kinda busy and the counter layout (non-dine in side) is not conducive to any sort of line or organization during prime times."
8477,12,4,1,11/17/2013,I don't like pizza.... If anything I like Chicago deep dish. But I love their pizza.
8478,12,4,1,8/22/2013,"Picollo's is an excellent choice for a wide variety of fresh pasta, pizza, sandwiches and salads. Place is always packed with business peeps and college kids, a very good sign. Just came back today from lunch at 12:15, had the pasta fagoli and veal parm sandwich. All very good, but the service was not. She was friendly. Our waitress servicing the main dining room area (sit down area, not walk-in pizza area) was slow and she seemed overwhelmed. We needed our check soon, she kept walking past w/o checking on us. My iced tea ran out as well, along with our neighbor table needing help, but she was just too slow. For a very busy place like this, you NEED to hire help that is very quick on their feet and able to get around and service ALOT of tables in ONE fell swoop, while remembering what they need. OR you need to hire more service people to make up for the slower one's. Either way, the Food is outstanding, the service is not. It's a BIG deal if you are trying to get back to the office to catch a meeting, etc. 4 stars cause the food is great, need to fix the service issue."
8479,12,2,1,8/2/2013,"I tried the pizzeria with my colleague today. It is way overprice. Besides, the pizza dough tasted like undercooked. I will not come back again."
8480,12,1,1,6/20/2013,Too bad we never were able to at least try out the restaurant as a coworker had recommended. ˜I was treated very unprofessionally by Mo. ˜Was booking a party of 40 for a Saturday night. ˜Was told 3 days after calling to make the reservation that we would be charged a minimum of $25 a person. ˜That was unacceptable 3 days later. ˜Needed to be told up front. ˜Didn't appreciate the over talking and yelling on the phone by Mo. ˜Had to cancel and find a more accommodating restaurant (which I did-Candela Restaurant).
7505,12,3,1,5/17/2013,Piccolo is a restaurant / pizza shop located in a nice strip mall. ˜Its divided into a nice dining room and your run of the mill pizza shop. ˜They have all the normal Italian choices and everything I have had has been great. ˜The Vodka Rigatoni is one of my favorites along with the Fig / Veal Pasta.
8481,12,4,1,5/14/2013,"Piccolos is a little out of the way for me but on occasion I don't mind the trip for a good, filling slice of pizza. The prices are a little on the high side, there's almost always a line and the dining area is cramped but in my opinion the food makes up for it. I've been here multiple times, have hosted catered luncheons for coworkers and still have yet to be disappointed."
8482,12,4,1,5/13/2013,"We went here for my mom's birthday and I must say, I was pleasantly surprised. It was cute inside and the service was very friendly. I had the crab cake over spinach and it was excellent. We also had the appetizer sampler and it was large and very good. A bit pricey, but we will be back!"
8483,12,2,1,5/3/2013,"I only come here for take out, as it is extremely close to my home. The food is decent, but the staff behind the counter is always rude. I stopped coming in after a few times... The food is not worth the bad attitude it's served with."
8484,12,3,1,3/1/2013,"Was here for a business lunch on a busy Thursday afternoon. The noise level was quite high, making conversation difficult, until the crowd thinned out. I felt a little cramped as well to the tables next to us. The food was good. I started with the pasta fagoli which was average. Soup should have been served hotter. I had a chicken entree. Only 1 piece of chicken, on a bed of ziti which were cooked perfectly. I tried a fellow diner's pizza which was not tasty...too much sauce, wilted basil, with a minimum of poor quality fresh mozzarella. The crust was just ok. The service was good, although it took a little too long for the entrees to come out.....it was peak however. All in all, it's a decent place, but is a chain, albeit a good one . I prefer mom and pop type of places."
8485,12,4,1,12/15/2012,Like the best pizza for me that comes with wide variety. :)
8486,12,4,1,11/13/2012,"I'm partial to Sicilian Pizza and outside of New York rarely find a good slice. Piccolo Trattoria makes a very good Sicilian pie. You know pizza is good when there is a line of people waiting to order. ˜I love this place, they make the best Sicilian pizza around."
8487,12,5,1,10/25/2012,"My wife and I were back in town with our kids. ˜We've been gone from the area for over 20 years, but we still know what good pizza is, and Fred and his team fit the bill. ˜What was even more important than how good the pizza tasted, was the fact that we got into town much later than anticipated, and by the time we dropped off everything in our hotel room, most every food place was closed, except for fast food. ˜We found Piccolo Trattoria at 10pm, just as they were wrapping things up for the night. ˜But, Fred opened the door and welcomed us in, as all we wanted was a takeout pizza. ˜We offered to leave, but Fred and his team took very good care of us and had us leaving with a smile, and soon thereafter, full bellies. We are in NJ for only a few days, but will try and make it back before we leave. ˜For those of you who live in the area and have not tried them yet, do so...you won't be dissapointed! Thanks again, Fred! ˜btw, sausage just the way I like it!"
8488,12,4,1,10/3/2012,"We have friends who live in the neighborhood and they love going there, so we said we'd give it a try & went with them about 2 years ago. ˜Since then, we've gone there with them several times! All the food is excellent in taste & quality; the service is superb! ˜Each server we've had is friendly, knowledgeable, very attentive & experienced ~ very professional. My absolute favorite appetizer is their Artichoke Fantasy. ˜Initially, 4 were served on the plate, which was perfect for a party of 4; then they reduced it to 3; I asked the server about it and he said that's what they serve now. ˜As we left, I mentioned it to the manager, but he brushed it off. ˜I would rather than increased the cost a little & return to serving 4 on a plate. The ambience and decor is quite nice & the seats are comfortable. ˜Some people come dressed up & others casual but not sloppy. ˜It is expensive, I assume partly because they serve high quality food. If you order one of the specials the server tells you about, you may want to ask what the cost is because it's usually much higher than any other menu item. It's BYOB ~ just a few doors away is a store where you can pick up a cold bottle of wine. In the nice weather, they have tables outside in a fenced off dining area ~ which is a nice change! When you leave, there is a large clear bowl of wrapped chocolate covered mints ~ be sure to take one or two on your way out... mmm. Piccolo's is located in the shopping mall at the opposite end from Stop & Shop, so the parking is in a public lot, but you are always able to park fairly close to the door. ˜I'm mentioning this since none of the choices below apply."
8489,12,5,1,10/3/2012,"Chicken Florentina with spinach/mozzarella over gnocchi. It's just so--I mean, it's like--and the sauce--that gnocchi--oh my God--it's just--I DIE. (Somewhat literally, because this dish has got to be pretty horrible for you, but take one bite and you will no longer care.) Piccolo's was my go-to when I went to TCNJ, and I still crave it (particularly the aforementioned beauteous gnocchi dish) all the time. The pizza has creative, yummy toppings, and any entree I tried was really good (but granted, I just went for the chicken florentina 9 times out of 10). I never really noticed the service because gnocchi is much more important to me; ditto with price. This place brings out my inner fattie and I'm totally OK with that. YUM."
8490,12,1,1,8/24/2012,"Every time I go to this place something happens & I swear I will never go back. That usually lasts about 6 months, & I decide to give them another try. ˜I am usually disappointed ˜& again swear I won't return. This time, I mean it. The food is decent, but there is plenty of good Italian dining in this area. Today, I was pressed for time, so I decided to grab a slice & a coke for lunch. The attitude & bad service is what always gets me here. I hate to feel like the server or counter person is doing me a favor to take my order, & that is the mo they follow here. I won't go into all the disappointing details, but I will give you one glaring one. As I cleared my ceramic plate from my slice of pizza & put it on the counter, I was told by the counter person, that wasn't good & that I had to remove it & put it in the in on top of the trash receptacle. ˜Hello??? ˜I waitressed for ˜many year when I was young, and ˜that's not SERVICE. Good bye ˜Piccolo Trattoria."
8491,12,4,1,7/22/2012,"Excellent Italian food. After Italian in NYC last weekend, I took two out of towners to Piccolo's last night. ˜Piccolos did not disappoint. And unlike the manhattan bistro we could actually talk to each other without yelling! The wait staff is excellent, the restaurant is clean and the ambiance is nice. The food was delicious. We had the special Bronzini with shrimp and asparagus. Excellent, but $32 seems a little high, which is the only reason it did not get five stars. ˜We also had mussels marinara $15 and veal saltobucca (ok, so spelling is not correct) $20. Both were also excellent and fairly priced. We will certainly return and expect to become regulars here."
8492,12,5,1,6/28/2012,"I come here for lunch all the time as it is one of my favorite pizza places. There's both a pizza counter section and a wait service section for the restaurant but I usually just go straight to the pizza counter. They offer a pretty wide selection of pizza by the slice that you wouldn't be able to find at most pizza places. Some of the pizza I've had there that I would recommend trying are the penne pasta, brocolli rabe and sausage, and chicken francaise. However I'm a huge fan of their Brooklyn Pizza; It is by far my favorite and I highly recommend it."
8493,12,1,1,1/20/2012,I was here for a private party luncheon and the food was really bad. ˜It was barely edible. ˜Avoid this place at all costs.
8494,12,4,1,1/15/2012,"Go to the left and you're at the pizza counter, go to the right and there is table service. ˜I'm a much bigger fan of their pizza menu than their regular/table service menu. ˜Best Brooklyn pie I've ever had, hands down. ˜Nice crispy crust, delicious chunky tomato sauce, and thick slices of mozzarella, yum! ˜Great selection of pizza by the slice. ˜I haven't had anything bad at Piccolo from their regular menu, however their servers always seem to want to clear your plate before you're finished (this has happened on multiple occasions)."
8495,12,2,1,1/6/2012,"I've been here several times and the food is mediocre at best. The last time I sat down to eat at Piccolo with my family, I had the chicken piccatta. It was nothing special and the sauce was all concentrated into one section of the dish. Our waitress seemed irritable and was annoyed when my dad tried to use a coupon. Apparently their coupons aren't valid on holidays (it was Christmas Eve), but nowhere on the coupon does it actually say that. Anyway, we decided to give it another try the following week for takeout because we heard that the Brooklyn pizza is amazing. It was not even close. The sauce was way too sweet and the other ingredients did not taste fresh at all. I'm giving PIccolo two stars because the food wasn't terrible to the point of inedibility, but we won't be returning here any time soon."
8496,12,4,1,11/17/2011,Chicken Saltimboca was very good. Service very attentive. Nice family restaurant.
8497,12,4,1,10/23/2011,"I have only had their pizza and a sandwich, but from those experiences, I can say that their product is top notch. ˜It is well run and clean resturant. ˜If you have a craving for a unique slice of pizza or just a good chicken parm sandwich, this is your spot in Pennington. ˜I can not say enough about how good the food is, you will have to go there and you will have the same feelings about it as I do."
8498,12,5,1,7/10/2011,"This place is very well priced, and although a chain it's super nice. ˜i have had a great swordfish salad there, and my favorite things to get are their salad w/blue cheese apples, walnuts, and balsamic dressing, and their veggie panini w/pesto and mozzarella. ˜they do a great job and have an extensive dessert case as well. ˜their pizza goes from thin ot thick crust, overall a great buy. WEnt back again when I came home for dinner, we had a great mozz dish, that was pan fried witha tomato garlic sauce (yum) and I got the eggplant rolatini for dinner - it was good but not that hot so I was let down a little."
8499,12,3,1,2/4/2011,"Somewhat pricey for what it is, the food is pretty good but not amazing, their simple dishes are slightly better then their fancier dishes. The staff is pretty good. The worst thing that I can say is that if you go for lunch, try to avoid the pizzeria part as the logistics are consistently poor and you will wait too long too often. Still this gets on the high end of the 3 star scale."
8500,12,3,1,7/4/2010,"I've eaten here twice: once for a company party and once for dinner recently. This is a slightly trying-to-be upscale, basic American-Italian restaurant. I tried a variety of things at the party, and carbonara with house salad during a recent dinner. The food is acceptable but its nothing really special. The house salad dressing is way too sweet, and the carbonara sauce is gluey, has no detectable egginess, and does not include peas. The fries are awesome--big flat steak fries. Nothing really stood out at the party, although nothing was bad, either. The dining room is really new and sort of nice, but sort of oddly lit, so it feels shadowy in an unpleasant way. The service is excellent, and outshines the food."
8501,12,4,1,5/28/2010,We eat here all the time. ˜The food is amazing. ˜Vodka sauce over angel hair pasta is the way to go. ˜The fish and chicken dishes are also very good.
8502,12,5,1,3/24/2010,"Best pizza in Mercer County, hands down. Dinners are great as well, good customer service. I've been going for some time to this place, never bad service or food."
8503,12,4,1,2/9/2010,"Ok, I used to drive a bread truck in Brooklyn so I know what I'm talking about when it comes to pizza. Now I drive in Jersey and I was passing by this place when I felt a dump brewing. Must have been the 6 cups of coffee I poured down my grill so I wouldn't run off the road. So listen, this place is fantastic. The Brooklyn Pie is the closest to NY I've ever tasted. I've tried some other local joints and the Brooklyn pie was a freakin' joke. I took a friend to one of these other pizza joints and when they served the Brooklyn my boy Paulie threw it on the floor. Ok, so to make it simple - Piccolo is good. Take your girlfriend, family or whatever. They'll love this dump. Bachagalupe!"
8504,12,2,1,5/23/2009,"The food is decent and reasonably priced. Notable exceptions are the large calzone and family-sized stromboli, which are very good, huge, and cheap (each can easily feed 3-5 people). My wife and I stopped going here for anything but takeout because of the consistently slow, poor, and rude staff. We still aren't spared poor service; the guy who runs the takeout counter is ALWAYS in a bad mood. However, if you need Italian food and don't mind lousy service, this place is worth a try."
8505,12,3,1,5/20/2008,"This is a very nice place, moderate sized dining room plus patio seating. Menu is uniformly good. ˜Prices are moderate. ˜I especially like artichoke fantasia and fried artichoke as starters. ˜Chicken parm and shrimp parm very nice. My wife likes the lobster cakes. She had the chicken fico (with figs) twice - first time was excellent but second time around the ingredients were not fresh and she was disappointed. Good desserts. BYOB. Service is decent but can vary depending on the server. ˜ Be warned - the connecting pizza parlor sometimes hosts kids parties. Noise level can be annoying."
8506,4201,1,0,9/13/2013,"Dirty! I believe the other post about pest control being seen here! For starters, the people who gave compliments to this dive bar must be friends with the people who own the place trying to help them out. I went there with a few co-worker/friends for burgers one night and you couldn't pay me to go back. After speaking our young waitress who was surprisingly open (maybe a little too open) I found out this was an old grungy local bar that a couple of brothers who live locally bought, tried to fix up and pretty much use as their personal playground when the restaurant shuts down and patrons aren't there (I'll leave it at very unsanitary things!). After not being able to finish my burger because it tasted like a tough frozen patty, my friends complaining how disgusting their food was too we flagged down the waitress and we each complained about what we had. She rolled her eyes as if to say ""again"" like she was used to hearing the same complaints. We still left her a tip because it wasn't her fault. My biggest mistake of all was I decided to use the restroom before we drove home. Couldn't believe what I saw... MICE DROPPINGS in the bathroom!!! I got my friends and we got out of there! Don't know how this place is still open!"
8507,4201,1,0,3/28/2012,"So are the other reviewers friends of the owners? Went to Old Canal Inn with my family tonight and it was terrible. The cheese steak was warmed over and tough, I barely made it through half of it and declined to take the rest home; my onion rings were dark and greasy. My daughter's french fries were limp and cold. Burgers were mediocre at best and that is supposed to be their specialty. Only saving grace was the iceberg lettuce wedge salad and the ˜wine glasses are huge! We went to the Old Canal Inn because it is owned by locals but the owners really need to pay more attention to the quality of the food. What a waste of $75 for 4 people!"
8508,4201,2,0,8/8/2011,"As a food blogger who lives two blocks from this place - I was really happy to see it return. ˜The beers are pretty cheap and the bartenders are pretty and friendly. ˜Though the food is well priced, it's not meant for foodies like me. ˜Tried the burger and was extremely disappointed - basically something you would find at an ordinary backyard cookout, basic patty on a basic bun - no effort made. ˜I know they just opened and I'm willing to keep trying more items but why is it so damn hard to find a good burger around here!!!!!"
8509,4201,4,0,12/16/2014,"This place is a great bar with live music but not a place to go sit for dinner. ˜The menu is good as far as bar food goes. ˜The beers are cold and the staff is excellent. ˜We stop in on Friday or Saturday to catch a band or a DJ. Not a sports bar not a place to eat, basic bar with some food, bands and beer."

8511,4201,4,0,3/16/2014,"Been wanting to check this place out since I read about it in Weird NJ magazine. ˜Met friends for a quick drink late Saturday afternoon so it wasn't busy and had a great opportunity to look around. Very cool and interesting place. Great beer selection and top shelf alcohol at reasonable prices. ˜And the staff and owners were genuinely friendly. Had to leave but came back later that night with more friends. ˜Band was playing a little too loud so we grabbed a table in the bar. We didn't all have seats, and I think it was an owner who offered to get us some bar stools. My friend commented, when was the last time you were in a bar and they brought you seats? The bar itself was jammed but I managed to find a spot to order. There were 3 very busy bartenders but I was taken care of fairly quickly each time I went to order...nothing makes me crazier than when a bartender looks everywhere but at you. These ladies get high marks from me. Interesting clientele, wide age range. I was probably one of the oldest people there but I felt comfortable. We did not eat so I cannot comment on the food. In sum, interesting vibe, lots of character, great drinks, reasonable prices, great customer service, we all agreed we'd go back."
8512,4201,4,0,10/12/2012,"This is a great local bar to hang out and play shuffle board while drinking craft brews, albeit only in a bottle, but craft nonetheless! ˜The food is average at best, unless it's the Death Seat Burger on Monday nights. ˜How can you go wrong with a beer battered deep fried burger served over macaroni salad and french fries. ˜Competition with the Garbage Plate from Rochester!"
8513,4201,5,0,5/11/2014,"Found this place by accident on a drive home once. Turns out, my grandfather used to come here all the time, so its got some history. Great food every time, with what I think are some of the best buffalo wings in the area. I've always had great service. I've never been there to see it in person, but apparently they have live music performances. You might have to fight for a parking space though, since their parking lot isn't very big."
8514,4201,5,0,10/11/2013,"Went here with a group of friends a few weeks ago for appetizers and drinks. We were only going to stay a little while but decided since we were having such a good time playing Shuffle Board we would stay, then a band went on and we stayed a while longer.

8518,4201,5,0,4/10/2012,Great neighborhood bar with excellent food. The friendly bartenders and waiters make this place a guaranteed great time.

8520,4201,5,0,1/12/2012,"I was amazed and delighted by high end, fresh food in a cool vintage looking pub - they have a separate dining room, a game room with shuffleboard! and a cool bar with a famous legendary ""death seat"" where 3 bar patrons died in the sixties (at different times)...It's funny. But the food was really good - and I write about food for a newspaper. The burger was made from very high quality fresh beef (not frozen) and the owner whipped up a baked ziti with roasted garlic, sausage, prosciutto and no ricotta which was wonderful. Going to check out the live music this weekend - I'm hooked! Diane Lilli"

5790,4201,4,1,11/17/2014,"Been here a few times in the past year, and this place continues to impress me. It's part local dive bar, part gastropub and part local music venue. I'm starting reconsider the last few years of my life when I insisted on heading 20 minutes away in order to enjoy some craft beer when I could have gone here instead. My first recent trip to OCI was to see my friend's band play. The entire upper section was dedicated to the show, and their friends were able to enjoy themselves without fear of bumping into people who just wanted to sit down and have a brew. This upper section had smaller, but still full, bar and a relatively decent beer selection. In the lower area is the main area complete with games (one of the longest shuffleboard tables I've seen), more tables and the bigger bar. Here you'll be able to pick from at least 20 different beers, including some relatively rare beers. If you're a beer aficionado, experimental or just want to have your name nailed to the taps, you can earn your way into the Old Canal Inn Craft Beer Social Club Membership. This requires you drink all 45 beers on their list. Be forewarned that 10 of the beers are seasonal, so you'll have to come in at least once a season. In addition to letting everyone else know you're an alcohol using craft beer as a justification, you get to take home a banner with your name and a member card. And if shelling out $6 x 45 isn't your style, you can enjoy their $2 PBRs."
8523,4201,2,1,11/9/2014,"Well the place was very noisy went with my family not a place for kids. Potato skins tasted like cardboard with cheese . Wings were ok, Mac and cheese bites I would not recommend. Main course was a burger on a stale roll I would not go back, waitress was good but atmosphere well unless you're into tv blaring I you're ear, and a bunch off football gas screaming."
8524,4201,4,1,10/25/2014,"Went to see a friend's band play and came early for dinner. I was not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the food. We ordered from the specials menu and started with the hickory wings and blackened steak bites appetizers. The steak was tender and tasty (though technically I wouldn't call them blackened) and came with a herb-mayo dip, fresh baby greens, and small garlic bread. For dinner, ˜I had the prime rib sandwich with garlic mayo and provolone done cheesesteak style w/ fries. Everything was done right with fresh ingredients. This coming from what people describe as a ""dive bar"". Not at all. And our servers we more than attentive! To boot the beer selection was great as well - both draft and bottles. I was just surprised we were the only table for dinner. Perhaps the word's not out yet on the great food? It should be."
8525,4201,4,1,9/1/2014,"Went there on a Tuesday night and the place had a good crowd, really love the old bars and this one does not disappoint, one of the owners came over and talked to us and gave us some info on the place, showed us the phone booth with all the things he said they found when they were redoing the place and things customers brought in, the food was very good and the beer was nice and cold, will be going back very soon, and don't forget to look at the old T bird outside, what is inside is creepy but funny."
8526,4201,1,1,8/29/2014,"I hadn't been there in many years. So my family and I decided to try it out. First impressions dark and dirty. It's a bar, with a almost empty dining room room in the back. 1st item, french onion soup. Bottom of the pot salty. 2nd item Nachos. Very little near meatless chili. no guacamole, and cheese sauce. My wife got the coconut shrimp, it was good. My daughter got 5 under cooked mozzarella sticks. My son had the Jersey burger. A $10.00 burger should have a generous beef patti. Where's the beef! I had the chicken marsala. The chicken was tough and over cooked. The sauce was dark brown with no hint of marsala in it. More like salsbury steak gravy. The powdered mash potatoes just finished the dish. I also thought the prices were on the high side. we had 2 half priced beers and 1 soda. The bill was $77. All things considered, I wont be going back there anytime soon."
8527,4201,4,1,6/25/2014,"Old Canal Inn is just a great, cozy place to hang with friends and have a fun night or catch a quick meal and a drink or two after a movie or game. I've been going there for a while now and always have a good time there with friends. You can hang by the bar where the gorgeous OCI girls will make sure your glass stays full or head upstairs for dinner or live entertainment from bands, comedy acts or live-band Karaoke. The food is varied and pretty decent, If you want gourmet fare then head to a fancy restaurant. If all you want is a good burger or wings or pasta, the food here is just fine and the menu is larger then one would expect normally in a pub. There are a varied selection of beers on tap and a large bottled craft beer menu too. The place has a great atmosphere and the owners and bartenders always make you feel welcome. If you are like me and prefer pubs over clubs or fancy over-priced restaurants, this is a great little place to meet with friends and watch the latest ballgame or listen to some music while knocking back a few. A fun, cozy and friendly place to chill and have a few drinks with your crew."
8528,4201,4,1,5/18/2014,"Moved back to North Jersey after many years away. ˜It's been 24 years since my husband and I went here. ˜Went back tonight - it's exactly the same (except for the bartender who probably wasn't born yet when we went!) ˜Don't know about the food, but we love the atmosphere, the beer and the tabletop shuffleboard! ˜Who says you can't go home again? ˜(Would've tried the wings but saw they were breaded... those aren't true buffalo wings.)"
8529,4201,2,1,2/23/2014,me and my dad saw our friends band perform here. its a dive bar. nothing special. its just not my scene. but i do remember ordering food and wut i had was good. just can't remember wut it was. its been a long time.
8530,4201,5,1,2/22/2014,"For the little hole in the wall feel this place has, it has an amazing beer selection. ˜Great people ˜ ˜very solid food ˜ live music. ˜ What is there not to love."
8531,4201,4,1,2/9/2014,"Another bar that I wish was much, much closer. We walked in to country music playing and what looked to be a few regulars at the bar. ˜We checked out the game room then settled in at a high top table in the bar area. This is a place filled with cool history like ""The Death Seat"" and sitting along the old site of the Morris canal. ˜Service was fast and friendly and we loved that happy hour was 12-7 Monday - Saturday. ˜$2 PBR drafts were perfect as my husband beat me in 2 rounds of arcade beer pong. ˜That's right it's an arcade version of beer pong, $1 per player per round and well worth it. There is also a shuffle board in the game room. We ordered mac n cheese bites and chicken fingers and both were good bar food quality. The dining room raises this out of complete dive bar distinction but we both commented on how we like the feel and history of the entire place. Looks like there is outdoor seating off the dining room for the warmer months. Very happy we made the trip."
8532,4201,5,1,1/30/2014,"If you would like something fun and easy to do for a change? Go to the Old Canal Inn. There you will eat good comfort food, drink a large variety of Domestic & Imported beers, receive friendly service, and watch live entertainment. On Friday night, January 31st, 2014, catch the return of ""Jammin with the Band"". Brad and the boys will thoroughly entertain you with their large repertoire of music as they play backup accompliment for songs sung by a variety of patrons. This is great fun to watch and participate in, and provides a chance to express your inner ""rock star"" self. If your lucky, you may even catch a song sung by Brad's wonderful wife K.T. She is the current ""Angel"" of this long time establishment. With a beautiful voice, and a sweet personality, she will more than inspire you to give singing ""a shot"". There is an extensive song list for you to choose from. In addition to the entertainment, there are two full bars, shuffleboard and of course darts. Get over to the Old canal Inn!"
8533,4201,4,1,1/8/2014,Loved the look and feel of this place and all the cool history that goes along with it! I usually go for the live music and food on the weekends! The staff is very friendly and great place to just chill out!
8534,4201,4,1,12/14/2013,"My dad used to own this place with a partner. Back then they called it Jo Jos #2. My cousin Fran has so many stories of the OCI that I can't begin to tell you. They lived not too far from this ICON in N.J. I was born and raised in Orange, went to school @ Bloomfield Tech. now reside in Roseville Ca. I wish we had places like this to go to. All the best to the owners and all I can say is keep up the great work. Joe Novinski"
8535,4201,4,1,5/19/2013,"This place was a surprising find. We were looking for some place to watch some football while visiting friends. They had an pretty impressive beer selection, and $5 wings on Sundays. Too bad it's not closer to where I live."
8536,4201,4,1,3/3/2013,"Nice cozy little spot in the middle of Bloomfield... passed it a million times but it was worth it. If you went to Bloomfield high, you are guaranteed to run into someone here.."
8537,4201,5,1,1/29/2013,"I come here at least once a week. The food is great as well as the service. By the way if you like specialty beers, they have them all. The also have a beer social club where you earn gift cards. This is hands down my favorite bar."
8538,4201,3,1,1/22/2013,"Perfect for what it is - a great divey bar with a friendly local clientele, a well-stocked jukebox, live music, decent bar food, shuffleboard, darts, cute and friendly bartenders, and...THE DEATH CHAIR. Nothing not to like about the OCI."
8539,4201,3,1,8/26/2012,Love this place a lot! ˜The staff is really friendly and very attentive. Live music a big plus! ˜Went with a small group and we had a great time. Love being able to support a local business and Very nice to be greeted by the owners who were very nice.
8540,4201,2,1,8/19/2012,"Went there on a Saturday at about 7:00. An order of onion rings took 45 minutes. Burgers followed at the 1-hour mark. Food was nothing spectacular. There were only 4 tables filled in the place, so the delay was confusing."
8541,4201,2,1,5/21/2012,"For a dive bar, the food is not bad, but I think we went on a day when the manager or person in charge was on vacation. I went there with a couple friends for lunch in the middle of the week to grab a burger. ˜After my friends and I ordered our food, some guy comes out with, like, a three gallon jug of smelly pesticides (the kind that you can almost taste in your mouth at the slightest spray) and he just starts spraying all the corners of the room we are sitting in and all around us. Several of us had to scream ""Excuse me! Can you not spray pesticides all over like that while we are eating?"" more than once before the guy realized we were talking to him! Which means they aren't following safety protocol for pesticide application. ˜Every restaurant I've worked in, it had to be done after hours, overnight, after the staff had wrapped everything up (utensils, etc.) in plastic, so you weren't eating off plates with a slight coating of poison on them the next day. It's too bad, because the food wasn't all that bad, and the new paint job looked nice. ˜They need to reprimand the guy with the pesticides. ˜That's not safe. P.S. As for the ""has TV"" question below, the answer is yes, and all the channels are turned to sports...ANY sports, so if you don't want to watch deer hunters killing Bambi while you eat your lunch, make sure you aren't facing a TV set."
8542,4201,3,1,3/7/2012,Old Canal is back and looks better and glad it didnt close for good. They still kept one shuffleboard so that was cool. Ill hit this place usually on my way somewhere else but went last Saturday and the place was packed. Def get a mix of young and old and the bar is long and easy to score a drink. Everyone loves to check out the death seat at the end of the bar so pay your respects. ˜Another local spot to add to the mix
8543,4201,5,1,2/20/2012,"The atmosphere is great the bar is clean and up to date! The food is awesome had the quesadillas and their Death Seat burger was unreal, loved the beer battered and deep fried crunchiness!! A must taste if visiting the place. ˜I will be visiting them often!!!!"
8544,4201,5,1,1/15/2012,Great Place to eat at and fun place to hang at. Cooldest tap beer around. Great staff and friendly bartenders. A place to vist to have some fun. LOVE THIS PLACE. JP
8545,4201,5,1,11/13/2011,Great place for drinks in the evening with friends ˜and dinner with the family in the daytime. ˜ ˜Fast friendly attentive service. ˜Been back a few times and everything on the menu has been great. ˜ ˜ ˜Definately will be going back.
8546,4201,5,1,11/3/2011,"Love the burgers and the servers/bartenders. good drink specials and SHUFFLEBOARD!!! go here and bring your friends, its a great local bar owned by local guys that deserves a chance!"
8547,4201,5,1,9/1/2011,"Went there with my son seeking out the perfect Hamburger well we definitely found it at The Old Canal Inn which is a great neighborhood bar/restaurant a really cool place to hang out. The burger was juicy and extremely flavorful with a nice portion of fries and cole slaw and very reasonably priced our waitress was very friendly and very attentive, this is one of our new favorite restaurants we will be back...The red sign outside is very cool!"
8548,4201,4,1,8/9/2011,"I love this place, in part because I can walk there and crawl home if needed LOL. ˜Seriously it is a fun, casual place with good, basic food (burgers, chili and homemade fries are standouts) friendly service, good jukebox, shuffleboard table, lots of big screens to watch your game of choice. ˜Bands are coming soon."
8549,4201,5,1,5/10/2011,"You cant ask for much more in a local bar. Recently re opened and dusted off The Old Canal Inn has it all. The regulars literally haunt the place. Be careful where you sit, ask the bartender where the death seat is."
8550,15,1,0,8/7/2013,"Tried a burger from here it was horrible & ˜expensive, I won't go back again!"
8551,15,1,0,5/12/2013,"If I could give it no stars I would. We went there with a party of ten. Let me start of as saying that I can completely sympathize with anyone in the service industry. It's not easy at all. We all ordered our food and were pretty excited as everything on the menu sounded like it was well thought out and would be prepared just as well. ˜They sent out one order of grits and two pancakes first for some reason. The pancakes weren't cooked all the way....Pancakes...We were later told that they are ""vegan"" and that's why the texture was the way it was. The grits. I am using that term very loose. They were dry and horrible. Then we waited. For a long time. Three tables on the deck sat after us, and ordered after us, and still had food delivered before us. I ordered the banana walnut French toast. It was just okay. I also ordered a side of bacon. It was literally one piece of bacon broken in half. Did I mention the wait. Yeah. Because the waitress didn't. ˜If the kitchen is clearly dropping the ball, tell the manager and make it up to your table. It was like the elephant in the room. Finally someone I assume was the manager (he never really explained who he was) said we are really sorry for the wait, ˜the kitchen is backed up or some excuse, I couldn't really hear him because he only addressed one half of the table. I will finish by saying that I will never return. You can draw your own conclusions but rolling the dice you might loose out too. ˜There are plenty of good places in the area that I have never had a bad experience at."
8552,15,2,0,8/21/2013,Food is not very good. Service leaves much to be desired.
8553,15,4,0,12/28/2014,"Jesse is a really awesome, friendly bartender and he makes amazing cocktails that my girlfriend and I enjoy. Killer beer list and I LOVE THE VEGGIE WINGS"
5803,15,4,0,11/1/2014,"Cedar Point hasn't been around too long but it's already a Fishtown gem. The menu is a bit hit or miss, to be honest. The kale burger, which had great potential, was bland and crumbly. I've had fries that were crispy and flavorful and amazing, and some days they're limp. However, the vegetarian wings are the best I've ever had and I honestly dream about them some nights. Po boys are solid and huge, cauliflower fritters and peanut butter greens are one of the most delicious and unique things I've tasted in the city. I just really love the vibe of this place. Always something solid to choose on the menu, great drinks, good people. If you ordered something you didn't love the first time, definitely worth another shot. Good addition to the neighborhood!"
8554,15,4,0,10/20/2014,"We recently enjoyed dinner on a Friday evening at Cedar Point's outdoor patio. Cedar Point ˜was crowded but the hostess handled the seating well. We didn't have to wait too long. ˜ The waiter was also attentive and our food came quickly. As an appetizer, we shared tender chicken wings which were spicy but not too hot, and which came with grilled Brussel sprouts, a ˜great contrast. ˜My husband had fish and chips- the batter wasn't greasy and the fish was moist and really tasty; as good as any we enjoyed in Ireland and England. And ˜the potato ˜fries combined with sweet potato fries were a yummy compliment. I ordered the kale burger- it was good but it could have used more spice for my palate. So I borrowed the sauces that came with the fish and chips. Definitely recommend Cedar Point for good food, good atmosphere, good experience at great prices."
8555,15,4,0,10/21/2013,"The food is ok. ˜The service is great, and if your feeling boardwalk empire then the cocktails are right up your alley."
6390,15,5,0,12/15/2014,"Stopped in for brunch and had the Pork Roll breakfast sandwich. ˜It was a special so I wanted to try it out. ˜Several meaty slices on focaccia topped with a fried green tomato, cheese, sunny egg, and honey mustard drizzle. ˜ ˜One of the best breakfast sandwiches in the city. ˜Please please please put this on the menu! ˜Staff was great as usual."
8556,15,5,0,11/5/2014,"This place is awesome! It's a bit of a chameleon in terms of the vibe - during Eagles games can feel like a sports bar, Tuesday night supper can feel romantic and hushed. The food is always amazing. Great mussels! They rotate a lot of dishes so you can't expect your favorite to always be available...if they ever get rid of the veggie wings I will be crushed! Cocktails are a bit pricey but I usually switch to beer after one and I'm still happy. I actually prefer this place to Loco Pez across the street."
8557,15,5,0,10/15/2014,"AH-MAY-ZING! 1.) The Staff: courteous, outgoing, friendly, helpful, super freaking adorable, maybe even a little HOTT ;) 2.) The Spot: Relaxed, everytime i've been they've been bumping some awesome beats. 3.) THE FOOD: where do I begin? Um, the half priced wings at happy hour at seriously out of control! This place always has the most amazing specials! Vegan Chili? Steak tip sandwich? hush puppies? YES FUCKING YES. 4) The drank: I'm not a huge beer drinker but my man friend is and he is always real impressed with the line up. ALSO, their cocktails don't get enough play..The Fishtown 75 is so good ˜that it makes me want to sell all of my belongings and move in under their (freaking rad and awesome for this mild fall) deck and spend all of my days drinking it. Keep doin' your thang, Cedar Point!"
8558,15,5,0,10/12/2014,"Last week was going to be just another ho hum Wednesday night until I found myself at Cedar Point Bar and Kitchen ˜My girlfriend and I met a friend for dinner and drinks. She's a vegetarian, we are die hard meatasauruses, but Cedar Point had choices for all. From the fried pickles to the kale burger to the pulled pork sandwich, our meals were presented with artistic flair and amazing flavors. The mac n cheese was awesomely delicious as always! Our waiter was extremely knowledgable re: what drinks to pair with our appetizers and main dishes. The night turned into a 3 hour planning session for my friends upcoming speech, but we never felt rushed to give up our table. Cedar Point will continue to be my go to place for a quick yummy bite or a wonderful taste of Philly for out of town guests."
8559,15,5,0,11/30/2013,"If I ever found myself in the situation where I had to choose my last meal, I would tell them to go to Cedar Point and get me the burger and fries. I live 3 blocks from here, and I've had the burger everywhere in Fishtown, Kraftwork, Lloyd, Sketch, etc. ˜All solid entries no doubt, but none touch the level of flavor achieved by Cedar Point. I realize the ""best burger"" conversation is highly subjective, so you can have your own favorite anywhere in the city...but this is mine. If you're never been here, the menu would give you the impression that this place is geared towards vegetarians and vegans. 2/3 of the menu is, but what they do with food for carnivores like myself is done 100% right. Let me elaborate on the burger, because it deserves elaboration: 1. The bun: it's brioche, so from the start it's got a flavor and soft texture unlike your standard white kaiser roll. Brioche is a type of bread made with butter and egg, the closest comparison would be like a really good potato roll. Like the rest of the ingredients, this flavor works with together with the rest of the flavors to produce a whole that's greater than just the sum of its ingredients. 2. The toppings: the lettuce is Boston Bibb, if you know this type of green you know it's also referred to as ""butter"" lettuce. There's no crunch like iceberg or romaine. I don't like the crunchiness of lettuce interfering with the texture of my burger. The tomatoes are Roma, the smaller ones that are usually canned that I use to make tomato sauce. They have more flavor than the giant beefsteak slices you usually see. And then there's good ole caramelized onions to finish it off. 3. The Sauce: The website says it's a pimiento aioli. This sauce in particular mixes with the caramelized onions in a way that really sets the flavor off, it's what makes this different from the other burgers in town. Wouldn't be the same without it. 4. The cheese: it's listed as ""herdsman"" cheese. I had to look this up, it's specifically from a local farm in south Jersey. It's like a mild, nutty flavored cheddar. It melts perfectly on top of the beef, and the flavor combines with the onions, sauce, toppings, and brioche to make this burger something else. 5. The beef: This is what separates the good from the great. There is no special concoction of spices or seasonings that can make beef taste the way it naturally should. The menu says it's grass fed, and it's consistently the freshest tasting beef I've ever had from a restaurant. And to boot, the patty itself is bigger than Kraftwork or Lloyd. The bun is just substantial enough to contain the heavenly combination of ingredients described herein. 6. The fries: They are fresh cut, which in Fishtown isn't uncommon (I'm just coming to realize how spoiled my neighborhood is making me). The difference here is that they're 50% white potatoes and 50% sweet potatoes mixed together. If burger meals came with cherries on top, that's what this is for me. So that's it. This is by far the most extensive description of something I've eaten that I've ever taken the time to write down. Some people like bacon and BBQ sauce, some like heavy seasoning and blue cheese, some just meat cheese and bun. For me, this burger is the best damn burger I've ever eaten. You should try it."
8560,15,5,0,6/22/2013,"I guess I'm somewhat of a seitan wings connoisseur. I'm always looking out for the best ones in the city. And hands down, Cedar Point has 'em! The tiny pieces make them nice and crunchy. The homemade sauce is the bomb; just the right amount of spice. The apricot horseradish is great. My hubby and I go here at least a couple times a month for their veggie wings. One server in particular knows us for our order at this point. Get these wings during happy hour (Tues-Fri 6,7 & Mon-Fri 10-12) & they're only $5!"
8561,15,4,1,1/9/2015,"Had a LOVELY brunch at Cedar Point Bar and Kitchen and just had to tell you about it! ˜Nice little ""locals"" place, it reminded me of the Bishop's Collar in Fairmount. ˜Love the atmosphere here, very laid back and casual. ˜I just love walking in a dark corner bar and finding something good cooking and that is just what happened at Cedar Point! ˜ Went with a party of 4 for second brunch, having already had first brunch at Sabrina's. ˜I was really in the mood for bacon and eggs, but was very tempted by the Chocolate chip bread pudding french toast, so I did what anyone would do and got both...My over easy eggs were slightly overdone, but nothing to complain about...the bacon was crisp and tasty...and for dessert, the Bread Pudding french toast...YUM! ˜Also served at our table...some type of avacado omelette was on special, my lady wife loved it...and someone ordered the biscuit and jam...wow, the jam was so sweet and the biscuit was titanic! ˜It was like someone made a giant biscuit and cut it into slices...went very well with a beer! ˜speaking of which, they have a very nice beer selection here. ˜Long gone are the days of Bud on tap! They describe their menu as...RETRO-AMERICAN CLASSICS MIXED with SOULFUL, CONTEMPORARY CONCEPTS. I'd buy that...they use local partners to get local fresh food and definitely have some contemporary concepts going on with the Blueberry corn Griddle Cakes, Fried chicken & waffle with BBQ Syrup, Veggie Wings, Kale Burger...they have a lot of interesting ideas here and I'd like to try them for dinner sometime. ˜The prices are just a tad on the high side, which kept them from 5 stars for me...11$ for Wings, Burger at 13$, but we were very pleased with our meal and will be back! ˜ One warning during these cold winter months...Don't take that table by the door!"
8562,15,5,1,1/7/2015,"What a lovely little place. ˜Maybe it was the holiday season or the christmas lights but I loved the ambiance of this place. ˜Makes you feel like you traveled to a little cabin tucked away up in Connecticut or Maine. ˜ And just as I was impressed with the ambiance, i was impressed with the food. ˜I'm not a vegan but their Kale burger is delicious. ˜It has a solid texture and a good balance of Kale and beans to make for a savory burger. Other favorite items include the Reuben, and veggie empanadas, ˜If you're with a larger party you only get two empanadas so better order more than 1. ˜:( Veggie wings seem to be a favorite amongst a lot of ppl, but I didn't really enjoy it. ˜It felt to greasy for my tastes buds. ˜But the brussel sprouts are amazing!!"
8563,15,4,1,1/6/2015,"We love the Cedar Point Bar and Kitchen. Great atmosphere, impeccable service, very well served portions and very good quality, a designated restaurant for all meals of the cafe in the morning for dinner. The belgian waffles with strawberries is simply divine. When in Philadelphia, do not miss, super recommend."
8564,15,5,1,12/28/2014,"My husband and I found this place from yelp reviews. I was a great pick. We are both Vegan and sometimes its hard to get good food and drinks but now here. This place has both. Many vegan dishes to pick from and drinks too. We tried the Veggie Wings, Caesar salad with buffalo cauliflower, french onion soup and kale burger. We also ordered El Ginger..... Everything was El Yummy..... I want to return soon. Service was awesome and the place was lovely...... Even if your not Vegan its a must go and eat place.... the menu is very tasty for all...."

8568,15,5,1,12/11/2014,"I've been to CPBK quite a few times now, usually at night for some drinks and an app or two. We've always had a great time enjoying the service, the food, and the drinks, but this past weekend our experience went above & beyond. ˜My husband planned a brunch for my birthday for 18 of our friends and family. ˜ CPBK executed this large party perfectly- not only were the brunch foods AMAZING- large servicing, phenomenal taste, and a huge variety to choose from, the service was phenomenal. ˜Our waiter managed our tables with ease. ˜The drinks flowed freely and no one left hungry. ˜I had the Sweet Potato French Toast - it was enough for two (but it tasted so good you won't want to share) as well as tried my mom's Toads in a Hole (great combo of egg and chorizo) and my husband's breakfast burger. ˜Each one equally delicious. ˜My only regret...not trying the chicken and waffles - our friend ordered them and they looked perfect- golden waffles topped with perfectly fried chicken. ˜That and I couldn't have a Bloody Mary -- they looked beyond amazing and I only heard rave reviews. ˜We'll certainly be taking our little ones there once they arrive so I can partake in one!

8572,15,4,1,11/18/2014,"I consider myself to be pretty lucky- Cedar Point is my neighborhood bar. The bartenders are great (shout out to Cassie, who used to be a bartender/server at our favorite bar in STATE COLLEGE) and the specials are awesome. 1/2 priced wings (which are fantastic) during happy hour (6-7p and during Eagles games) and $3 Sly Fox cans on Sundays are what keep me and Zack coming back. Food can be hit or miss. Stick to the appetizers and wings (chicken or veggie) and you'll be in good shape."

8574,15,5,1,11/7/2014,"Had such a great experience here just last week! I went with a group of 5 people and everything was perfect Three of us had the vegetarian wings and loved them so much. Another of us got the spinach salad and the last got the po boys. The atmosphere was great, the music was great, the service was supreme, and I can't wait to go back! I'm super picky about public restrooms, and theirs was mega clean :) Thanks guys"
8575,15,5,1,11/2/2014,"The only other wings that I crave more are at Pok Pok. ˜Just take the apricot horseradish sauce and pour it over the entire bowl of wings. ˜It's delicious and the fried brussels sprouts are a great change from the standard celery and carrots. ˜Add to this a great beer selection and half-priced wings during happy hour and Eagles games, and you've got a bar that's worth a visit (especially if Loco Pez is too packed). ˜ Great staff and a nice space with a nice deck in the warm weather."
8576,15,5,1,10/20/2014,I'm such a big fan of this place. The bartenders are always so friendly and knowledgable. Whenever I can't decide what to drink they know just what I want. The menu is full of amazing things. The veggie wings are a favorite as well as the burger and the chicken n waffles. I can't get enough of this place.
8577,15,5,1,10/20/2014,Awesome beer selection. Loved the vegan wings and my veggie burger based on kale and white beans. The (vegan) ˜spinach dip was great too and my husband enjoyed his vegetarian reuben. ˜Yeah yeah it has the NoLibs hipster vibe but just a little bit - i.e. feels current and progressive but not stiflingly so cause its very friendly. Definitely planning on going back again soon.
8578,15,4,1,10/14/2014,"My neighborhood ""go to"" place. Great food and relaxing atmosphere. Love the outside deck part and the service is great. Would love more veggie options though."
8579,15,5,1,10/13/2014,Nice place great staff and good ownership who is willing to fix any problem. I recommend the Cobb salad very good and great beer n drink specials. And always a change of food specials.
8580,15,5,1,10/12/2014,The food and atmosphere at CPBK are great! I am a big fan of the wings served with Brussel sprouts and the kale burger rocks. The outdoor seating is great and the bar is beautiful with creative and delicious cocktails and friendly staff.
8581,15,1,1,10/12/2014,"There is no way that I'm going to pay $13 for the same burger I paid $9 for 2 years ago. The beers have gotten smaller for the price and their liquor menu has been ""adjusted for cost"" BOOO!"
8582,15,5,1,10/8/2014,"Love love love this place! The atmosphere is great! You can tell someone hand picked the art pieces and it has a very relaxed hip vibe. ˜ The menu is a huge win. ˜We ordered vegan wings, vegan artichoke spinach dip, and they have a vegan mushroom stroganoff that I didn't order But can't wait to come back and try!!! I found out about this place because they sponsor the running team I'm on- runners for animals. ˜How cool that they care about supporting our community, and they have great food too! ˜Perfect spot for a drink or a meal! ˜Can't wait to come back!"
8583,15,5,1,9/26/2014,"I've been here a handful of times and I've never been disappointed. The food is great, I especially love the veggie wings (which is something I never thought I'd say, being a traditional buffalo wings lover). The catfish po boy, fried pickles and brisket pinwheel are some other items on the menu that I really enjoyed. The beer selection is incredible as well. They always have some good micro brews on tap. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and helpful when it comes to describing what's on tap and helping pick out a beer. Overall, a great place to eat and/or grab a drink. I'll keep going back."
8584,15,4,1,9/7/2014,"Brunch was delicious! Bill had red beans and rice with Andouille, spicy but yummy! I had red hash, great flavors beets sweet potato and poblanos. Both dishes with eggs over easy. Went perfectly with a cider and a Moscow mule."
8585,15,5,1,8/9/2014,Great food and drinks. ˜Great catfish y'all.
8586,15,2,1,8/9/2014,"Well, after many repeat visits it's time to update my review. I write this in hopes that the owners/management take note, but after being open for so long with so many bad reviews it doesn't seem likely. I think my biggest pet peeve with Cedar point is the lack of consistency. Drinks never taste the same, food never tastes the same, and it's a real bummer. I went in at the end of June and had a drink and then went back last night and had the same drink it tasted completely different and pretty terrible. ˜Train your bartenders!!! I've had the seitan wings a bunch of times, but last night they tasted like someone dumped a bottle of vinegar on them. This does seem to be the one thing Cedar Point is consistent with and that's mentioned in a bunch of other reviews. Cedar Point, calm your ass down with the vinegar! My other main annoyance is the deck. While in theory it's fantastic the chairs have to be the most uncomfortable seats I've ever had the displeasure to sit in. Mosquitoes are also pretty plentiful maybe they could add some citronella candles or use some other sort of natural bug repellent."
8587,15,3,1,8/9/2014,"Good looking food menu. Better draft list. Best atmosphere- we ate outside on the front porch. We got veggie wings (my fianc? is vegetarian) and she loved those. I got pulled pork sandwich with fries which was decent. However, we got the Mac & Cheese which essentially had no flavor (had to ask for salt/pepper). Also, she got a salad which was over priced and not that good. Overall, really nice place to sit outside in the nice summer weather and have drinks. But their food was only average and significantly over priced compared to other places in the city."
8588,15,4,1,8/8/2014,"I've tried this place 4 times now and I only have mixed feelings about the menu. ˜I really love the decor, ambiance, outdoor space, etc. ˜Can't go wrong with the drinks. ˜The food is almost there - they have the right flavors and concepts, but the execution is a little confused. ˜ I recently had a panini from the Garlic Scape Inspired Menu. ˜It was great, except for the whole scapes that were a little too crunchy and overwhelming. ˜Maybe a pesto would have been easier to eat? ˜I've also had the wings which were great, but the dipping sauce was a sweet apricot horseradish cream and I thought something else would have been more suitable (I don't know what that ""something else"" is). I want to have a meal there that will knock my socks off and I'll keep trying because they are in my neighborhood and the owner is very nice."
8589,15,4,1,8/6/2014,"I was skeptical about Cedar Point due to it's mixed reviews, but one point seemed to remain consistent (both in the yelp reviews and what I was told by friends): the veggie wings are amazing. I consider myself to be a connoisseur of veggie wings so I had to check it out for myself. The veggie (vegan, actually) wings really are amazing. They are so wonderfully crispy and nice & spicy. ˜Mixed into the bowl of wings are crispy fried Brussels sprouts which are also delicious. ˜I didn't bother with the dipping sauce because I don't need anything interfering with the delicious spiciness when I eat wings. Even if the patio is full, the inside atmosphere is great too. Service was fine. Not super attentive but not really slow either. I'll definitely return for some veggie wings and beer. They're so good that I don't even feel compelled to try anything else on the menu."
8590,15,3,1,7/27/2014,"This spot always seems to fumble it. On my first visit, they ran out of kale burgers. So I had to order an unmemorable sandwich. ˜Think it was a tempeh reuben, but I can't remember. The next time I was here it was for brunch. It was on there patio and the sun was shining. It was so intense and there weren't any umbrella for shade. I was roasting. The menu does offer vegetarian options, which is a plus. But the location is a far walk from the El. So they really make you work for it."
8591,15,5,1,7/27/2014,Really nice young place. Friendly staff. Good draft menu. Out of this world crab cake sandwich. Love their choice to have potatoes instead of fries.
6350,15,4,1,7/18/2014,"I haven't been here for food in a long time, so I won't make a judgement (although I remember it being middle of the road), but the outdoor patio area is a really nice spot to sit out and enjoy. ˜ Really solid craft beer list and the late night happy hour is a nice bonus. ˜From 10 to close on weekday nights it's a few bucks off of all draft beers. ˜The bartender last night was friendly and attentive even though someone kept asking him to make crazy cocktails."
8592,15,2,1,7/4/2014,"I take my last review back. I really wanted to like this places, but I've actually sworn off Cedar Point. The food is consistently not very good. The service isn't great. The food/drinks are over priced. There's so many other great places in the neighborhood; there's no reason to go here."
8593,15,3,1,7/3/2014,"I came here yesterday when Pez Loco turned me away. ˜There were only a few things on the menu that were GF; I got a cobb salad and an andouille corn dog. The cobb salad was good. ˜It's hard to compare cobb salads, I guess; I don't think I've ever had either a bad one or an outstanding one. ˜The andouille corn dog was a fun idea, and I'm glad I tried it. ˜The batter had a tendency to fall off, and the sausage was quite spicy. ˜It came with mustard, which I thought would be a bad combination, but I was mistaken. I also got a Sazerac. Total cost, including Sazerac, was $27."
8594,15,3,1,7/2/2014,"If it wasn't for their good booze selection and tasty garlicky fiddleheads, these guys would be suffering my wrath of having one of the worst veggie burgers I've ever tried. When you'd choose a Boca vegan patty over what is made in house, you know there's trouble. The price is above what you should be paying for the quality you get but man, that ambiance is pretty nice. I got to enjoy the scenery of awkward body language and conversation of a first date (the followup? she was REALLY into talking about herself, and the dude was having a hard time keeping focus. Good thing she was a total babe.)"
8595,15,5,1,6/25/2014,"Love this place. ˜I loved A Full Plate (their past restaurant) and now I love this place just as much. ˜Food is delicious, great drinks and great atmosphere. ˜I recommend the tempeh ruben and beet raviolis, they are delicious! Great outdoor deck for summer nights too!!!"
8596,15,1,1,6/2/2014,"I came to write another review of my 4th bad experience at Cedar Point on my 5th visit to CP and giggled at the draft that I felt too guilty to post from a year ago, I left it unaltered below for anyone to read in case it matters. Additionally I'd like to point out that I have tried to find a manager to tell them my issues but there never seems to be one around, and the fact that I can't get the attention of waitstaff is an added bonus. My girlfriend wanted to give Cedar Point another chance on a beautiful weekday night a couple weeks ago so I said I was okay with doing it, after all it had been a long while since I'd been there and people have said their veggie wings were amazing. Luckily I wasn't very hungry when I went. ˜ We wanted to sit on the deck but it had a short wait, about 15 minutes, we grabbed a beer at the bar, sly fox cans were 3 bucks that night. ˜We were sat quickly and ordered beers, the waiter brought me the wrong beer - not a big deal since I like all kinds of sly fox so I said it was okay and drank it. ˜We ordered food and it was dropped off by a different guy. ˜I got veggie wings and they were absolutely cold, the bowl was not even lukewarm. ˜I wasn't sure if they were supposed to be cold or hot so I texted my friend that raves over them and she said they weren't supposed to be. I would have asked a waiter this but there were none in sight for 5 minutes after my food was dropped off. I tried to grab my waiters attention - the deck was not full - but it seemed impossible and I am not one to shout out or chase someone down. ˜I sat trying to get the waiters attention for over 20 minutes while he cleared empty tables, I had no water, and empty beer and a full bowl of wings. ˜He finally stopped by for the first time after we had our food brought to us when I waved at him and said something. ˜I told him my food came out cold and that we had been there so long that I would just like the to leave. ˜My girlfriend had finished her meal several minutes before he had come over and I was done. ˜ Thankfully they comped my wings, just the wings. ˜I did think they would have been really delicious if they didn't come out cold. If I ever return to Cedar Point (unlikely) I will only go there to drink beer, hopefully the waiter will bring me more than one in an average of 40 minutes. **************************************************?**************************************************?********* The review I didn't post originally from a year ago: I've been to Cedar Point several times since my first review and thought it time for an update since they have been open quite awhile now. I find my own experiences at Cedar Point to be lackadaisical. At every visit service has been meh, or mediocre at best which is upsetting since I want so badly to like it. ˜ The space at Cedar point is great, an outdoor deck, a visually unique and appealing indoor decor, a decent to good beer list, clean. They have such a strong foundation to build off of. ˜Let me preface this that I have worked in the service industry before and although it has been quite awhile that is some of the hardest work I've ever done and also some very happy memories. I did have an ""okay""experience at Cedar Point once in particular was a lazy Saturday on the porch drinking beers, but my last experience was a huge miss. ˜It was a Friday and my GF wanted to go to Cedar Point and give it another try, I was game, we had some time to kill and wanted to sit outside. ˜The porch was full (the inside had plenty of tables) so we told the host we'd wait at the bar, he told us it would be ˜about 15 minutes.. ˜After about a half hour I thought there were open tables outside, but I couldn't see from my vantage point and didn't get up right away, we weren't in a rush so I was enjoying my beer. ˜A bit later the Host came up apologizing but he'd forgotten us, it was okay I wasn't upset and neither was my date. We sat outside, and waited... the waitress finally walked outside looked at us, and checked on another table and cleared some of their plates. ˜She then went back inside and disappeared for awhile then returned to another table. ˜The host in the meantime sat the rest of the open tables on the porch. ˜We waited some more... 10 or 15 minutes went by and the waitress walked towards us, and then stopped at a table that was sat a considerable amount of time after we were sat. ˜My GF who also has worked in the service a considerable amount of time was fed up and wanted to leave, but she wanted to tell the host or manager we were leaving at why. ˜She waited inside for awhile because the host wasn't around, the waitress finally came in and asked if there was a problem so she explained the above and that we were going across the street to Loco Pez where we know we will get great service, and we did. I am doubtful that I will be returning anytime soon or if at all."
8597,15,1,1,6/2/2014,"I tried. I really, really tried to like this place and make it a go-to spot. I live right by it. I mean, we came here semi-regularly for the entire first year it was open. I asked friends to be patient. I was patient. But, it's only getting worse and not better, and now I'm just angry that Cedar Point is taking up this beautiful space complete with an awesome outdoor deck. The food is incredibly hit or miss, and the only things I ever got into were the fried and not so healthy foods - wings, both chicken and veggie, and the mac and cheese. It doesn't matter even if these few items were good for me when I actually got served the disco biscuits with BURNT biscuits one time. I find that to be egregious lack of attention to detail in the kitchen, and when I pointed it out, the server's response was like, ""OK"" followed by a blank stare. I reached the end of my rope when a bartender just couldn't be bothered with our to-go order on a Thursday night. We wanted to order beers while we waited on our to-go order, so we're not a total loss when it comes to a tip especially considering all we wanted was for our order to be put in, pour us a couple beers, and then let us pay. I won't go back because I feel ashamed for tipping a bartender who was rude, annoyed by us, and then overcharged us in the end. So, that's it - I'm not coming back, and the person who used to say, ""give them a chance"" is shouting, ""never again, and you shouldn't either"" to anyone who will listen. Fishtown is too good for this establishment, and I'll wait for Loco Pez or make the slightly longer walk to Memphis Taproom, Kraftwork, Interstate Drafthouse, etc, etc, etc because the lists of places that serve better food with better service in that area is pretty much endless."
8598,15,4,1,5/18/2014,My idea of heaven is eating Cedar Point's chicken and waffles while soaking up some sun on their awesome outdoor deck. ˜The friendly service and yummy bloody mary's are added bonuses.
8599,15,4,1,5/13/2014,"greasy, but oh so good. I had the fried pickles [YUM] and a BLT sandwich that had a lot more of a bite then I thought it would. Delicious, but spicy.. couldn't stop eating it! yummy cheap beer too !"
8600,15,4,1,5/12/2014,"Good beer list and loved the negroni keg. Food was ok-corn dog was mushy, beet ravioli was too thick, brisket pinwheel had undercooked dough. Service was not great, but because they were understaffed, not because of staff. Busboy was a real hard worker, waiter was too, having to wash glasses at bar. What?"
8601,15,4,1,5/9/2014,"I've been to Cedar Point probably a half dozen times and I'm a fan. The food is tasty, unique and offers a lot of different choices. Fried green tomato po boy is probably one of my new favorite things, although it's just on the edge of too spicy for me. Bartenders are mostly friendly and offer good service, and the beer selection is pretty solid. Brunch was good too!"
8602,15,4,1,5/1/2014,"I become a bigger fan of Cedar Point with each visit. This place is 4 stars and rising. Drinkwise - you can't go wrong here. I'm a big fan of their varied beer list, from drafts to cans to 12 oz. bottles to the bigger bottles. The selection is always top notch, and the prices are affordable. ˜ They also have a great happy hour and daily drink specials. Foodwise - the Fried Chicken & Waffle is incredible."
8603,15,4,1,4/30/2014,"This is a cool, hip place to go in Fishtown! ˜Great place for drinks on the their deck during nice summer days. ˜On my first visit they had Sangria which was just ok. ˜I recommend sticking to beer and they have a nice draft list. I went with the Allagash White which has a nice fruity, smooth flavor. ˜The menu has almost a New Orleans feel to it with Po Boys etc. I went with the pulled pork sandwich with fries. It was delicious! Nice sweet flavor of the pulled pork on a fresh bun and the homemade fries were tasty. ˜Others in our large party of 10 ordered burgers and wings. ˜The service was quick even with our big group and they were able to pull together tables so we could sit outside."
8604,15,4,1,4/29/2014,"It's so hard to decide what to order here, everything on their menu sounds delicious and the food never disappoints. The Veggie Wings and the Chicken & Waffles are definitely two of my favorite items. Sweet & tangy and savory with perfectly fried chicken on a moist cornbread waffle, the chicken & waffles is perfection! The veggie wings are extra crispy and coated with an awesome buffalo sauce, makes me forget that I'm not eating real buffalo wings and it's perfect for sharing with vegan/vegetarian friends. ˜(Btw, they have great options for vegans/vegetarians) They also have awesome specialty cocktails and a decent beer selection. Their servers are friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this place."
8605,15,4,1,4/27/2014,We had a large party of about ten people. ˜They quickly moved tables together on the outside patio to accomodate us. ˜Interesting menu with lots of choices. ˜Many of us started with a allagash white. ˜Service was quick and friendly. ˜I went with the chicken wings with Brussels sprouts. ˜It came with ten fairly spicy wings. ˜The Brussels sprouts were delicious and crispy. ˜I appreciated that the waiter gave us all separate checks. ˜Fun place to people watch and enjoy good food and nice selection of beer.
8606,15,4,1,4/27/2014,"We started with Brussels sprouts veggies wings and they were the bomb! Also we tried some yummy cocktails from here (don't remember the name but they worth it). Friendly staff, cute decoration, exciting atmosphere...would definitely go there for Friday night!"
8607,15,5,1,4/26/2014,We stopped here for lunch after traffic prevented us from getting to our original destination. I guess it was predestined. This place is great. The food is slanted toward the healthy side but don't let that stop you. This place was well worth the stop and we will be coming back.
8608,15,3,1,4/21/2014,"(I'd give 3.5 stars but it's not an option) I live nearby and have been to Cedar Point maybe 6 times now. If I didn't live so close I probably wouldn't really come back. Although they're creative and offer interesting seasonal options, they consistently under salt (meaning no salt used at all) their food. Fried chicken, no salt. Buttermilk biscuit, no salt. Even the fries didn't have enough salt. This always leads to me being disappointed. One thing I loved was the vegan wings. You'd never care that they're vegan. Super crunchy and satisfying. The biscuits have really gotten better since they first opened, the texture is wonderful, but the lack of salt kills them. Part of me thinks they're avoiding salt to make the food healthier. Their menu boasts lots of vegetarian, vegan, and turkey based options. Maybe they're also watching our sodium for us too? I get trying to offer healthier foods, but without salt the food tastes like nothing, and it's a shame to waste a fluffy, well made biscuit by leaving it out."
8609,15,3,1,4/15/2014,"I showed up alone for a drink while I waited for my friends to meet me elsewhere. ˜I didn't realize it was Happy Hour, so I was pleasantly surprised when I cashed out. ˜It took a while for them to get to me, which was weird because I was sitting alone at the bar. ˜The deck was cute, and I would probably go often if I lived in the area, but I definitely don't need to go back since it's out of my way, usually. ˜Parking in that area is pretty easy. ˜Didn't try the food, so I can't comment on that."
8610,15,5,1,4/9/2014,Awesome restaurant in our neighborhood with creative and delicious menu. Beer selection rotates and will never leave you thirsty. We LOVE brunch here and sitting on the patio outside on a nice day is a great way to meet up with friends in the 'hood.
8611,15,4,1,4/3/2014,Great menu !! Awesome service even though I only eat at the bar ....try the cedar point lemonade !!!
8612,15,4,1,3/22/2014,"I decided to check this out on my quest to try all of the restaurants in my neighborhood. ˜I would say that nothing was outstanding, but everything was solid. ˜I had the catfish po boy, which was crispy with great flavors. ˜The portion was huge and I ended up enjoying the leftovers the next day. ˜It's in a convenient location to me, so I'll probably go back for a casual dinner with friends."
8613,15,3,1,3/6/2014,I went to Cedar Point during a strange period of my life where I tried being gluten free. ˜I couldn't drink any of the delicious sounding beers which was disappointing. ˜The menu did have a few things that were clearly gluten free and I thought I was making good choices by pairing a warm brussels sprout salad and the beet ravioli. ˜ The beet ravioli in theory is amazing- there is no real pasta in the dish and the 'pasta' is flattened pieces of beets filled with goat cheese. ˜My veggies dishes all looked delicious when they arrived... But then I started eating and what ensued was half an hour of vinegar overload. ˜I hate wasting food that I'm paying restaurant prices for so ate everything I ordered but my mouth was straight up watering and my eyes were tearing from the amount of vinegar in these dishes. ˜The beets were so so tart from vinegar and the greens that came on the side of the plate were wayyy overdressed. ˜I couldn't taste the goat cheese inside of the ravioli at all. ˜And then the brussels sprout salad also had a vinaigrette on it too....let's just say it became unpleasant. ˜I had to eat slowly just to let my mouth recover between bites. Hopefully I just got an overdressed dish because the beet ravioli are such a good idea and I would love to be able to try them again. ˜They have a lot of vegetarian and vegan options as well which is a plus. ˜Hopefully next time is better!
8614,15,5,1,2/25/2014,"LOVE THIS PLACE!! It has become our neighborhood bar, whether for drinks or meeting friends for dinner, the space is great and they are always willing to accommodate us. The staff are amazingly friendly, and always at the ready with a smile or drink/food recommendation. Very knowledgeable! Our favorites are the corn dogs, burger, chicken & waffles and the eclectic desserts. Beer selection is always impressive, and the cocktail list offers some wonderful concoctions."
8615,15,5,1,2/23/2014,Brunch here is extremely great. Their Bloody Mary is on point. To avoid the crowd though I usually come by for late night happy hour. Can't pass up their Brussel sprouts and veggie wings. Also their Mac and cheese is pretty great. Always a great draft list and the ˜servers are super friendly. Never disappointed.
8616,15,5,1,2/19/2014,"I came to this spot for my second time last night and was again delighted by my time there. ˜It was pretty filled for a Tuesday night, which is always a good thing to see. ˜It's clean and comfortable, if a little bit on the dim side. The beer selection here is great. ˜they have Philly staples like Kenzinger but also more select local beers. ˜I had a few but was most excited to drink the Yards ESA cask that was available. The highlight here is totally the food. ˜Amazingly, they have a VEGAN wild mushroom stroganoff. ˜It's freakin' vegan but this thing is so smooth and creamy that you would not be able to tell the difference. ˜It consists of campanelle noodles, peas, chopped green onion in this divine shallot cream sauce. ˜The pasta is great, the peas and onion add nice flavor hints but it has a strong mushroom taste that melts with the sauce. ˜It's priced a little high at $14 for what's in the dish, ˜but it made me happy, and I'll be shelling out the money again some time. Our server was really good. ˜He checked on us a good amount, and could read us to know when we wanted our check, which he brought quickly. ˜He was friendly and knew the menu well. ˜He did a great job. I highly recommend this place."
8617,15,5,1,2/18/2014,"What we ate: Fava tots: good, hot (temp) and happy Chicken and waffles: life changing.. best Ive had. The chicken was moist and the waffle a pillow of amazing Jambalaya: very spicy but had lots of shrimp and the corn bread was good. beer was a good selection and the happy hour draft was a great deal. I felt the pricing was fair and would happily pay it. Wait staff was attentive and did a great job We were there on a monday night so it was pretty mellow. I loved that it wasnt too loud!"
8618,15,2,1,2/17/2014,"I live around the corner from Cedar Point and I'd love to make it my go-to spot, but the food is simply not good enough to make that happen. The prices are extremely high for the quality and quantity - much like how I felt about the few times I ate at A Full Plate, the kitchen's execution just can't seem to match its ambition. Last night I ordered the Caesar salad which costs $13. ˜A bit $$$ compared to most Caesars but it includes blackened shrimp so I went with it. ˜What was delivered to me was a colorless pile of iceberg lettuce, some croutons, and 4 smallish shrimp. ˜The shrimp were decent enough but the iceberg was just plain insulting at that price (all legit Caesars are made with romaine). ˜It was a $6-$7 dish at best. ˜Had they used the correct lettuce, maybe some proper hints of lemon and anchovy in the dressing, and some substantially-sized shrimp, it would've been reasonable at that price point. Like most of my other visits there, I left completely underwhelmed."
8619,15,3,1,2/13/2014,"Very nice beer selection, but the food always tends to leave me less than impressed - the wings are nothing to write home about."
8620,15,4,1,2/13/2014,Another solid trip to Cedar Point. The wings with roasted Brussels sprouts were great. Cocktails were also very good.
8621,15,4,1,2/7/2014,"When tired of center city Philly, why not head over to fishtown. ˜I'm all for places that are vegetarian friendly. ˜Those fried brussels with apricot horseradish sauce was yummo. ˜They were so crispy and chip-like. ˜I'm definitely ˜going to try to make it at home. ˜The veggie wing was seasoned with buffalo sauce. ˜It got a bit spicy as you eat more and a bit too crunchy, not much ""meaty"" pieces. ˜The cornbread waffle was awesome. ˜I'm gonna try this at home too! ˜They have a nice beer list. ˜I couldn't make up my mind so i opted for a flight and the serving size was heftier than other flights i've had. ˜Looking forward to checking out their lunch/dinner menu."
8622,15,4,1,2/4/2014,"A hidden neighborhood gem! The draft list is normally decent with at least 2-3 really good selections. My boyfriend wasn't wild about the menu and I'm not either but we do love the chicken with waffles. It's legit. And there are some other choices we wanna try, we're just not ""foodies"" some stuff is a little out there. I can't wait to go back & sit on the deck! Haven't had bad service minus the one bartender seemed like we were putting her out by coming in for a beer.. Oh well"
8623,15,4,1,2/4/2014,"I really like Cedar Point, namely the atmosphere. Really cool, modern-industrial decor with a nice outdoor deck that's great for brunch in the spring. Servers are all really nice and have always been willing to help me pick a beer. I'm happy it's so close to my house because they have great happy hour specials. All their food is decent (if they ever have the baked chili mac and cheese on special, do not pass it up!). One time the biscuits in my vegan biscuits and gravy were hard, though."
8624,15,5,1,1/27/2014,"I absolutely LOVE this place. Creative, delicious menu. Perfect Old Fashions. Went for brunch. Can't wait to go back. Had the Creole Egg Bake with shrimp. A fantastic Louisiana twist on baked eggs. The big biscuits are homemade, fluffy and moist. Breakfast burger was as delicious as it was messy! Can't wait for more!"
8625,15,4,1,1/16/2014,"Cedar Point is pretty legit. My girlfriend and I have been twice and thought our food was great. We've had the vegetarian chili, the pulled pork sandwich, and the white bean kale burger. It was super tasty and filling. The beer selection is alright, but overall the service is great and the atmosphere is cool."
8626,15,5,1,1/14/2014,Been here twice now and the burger and wings are some of the best you can find in the city. ˜Amazing flavors. ˜Can't wait to go back!
8627,15,5,1,12/23/2013,"Very attentive service. Fresh and local (sourcing ingredients from local growers like Greensgrow). Inventive (beet ""ravioli"" made from sliced beets as the ""pasta""). It's a great place to impress people that not only Philly can offer something like this, but my very own neighborhood. And lacking any sort of snobbery. I've discovered some great beers here that I've never come across anywhere else. There's some great cocktails too--I forget what it's called, but it involved scotch and lavender. Yum."
8628,15,5,1,12/22/2013,"So, this is my final review of this place. I've been waiting for some sort of inconsistency, but I'm convinced this place is perfect. So updating my reviews is no longer needed. I went in today for a late lunch I got the ""Burger"". It was an amazing burger using grass fed beef with a Sunny Side Up egg. Now, I've had burgers with ""sunny side up"" eggs before that were just over done, over fried eggs. This burger was just dripping with yolk and cooked to perfection goodness. I avoided the burger here for a while now because I've had good burgers before.....what could they do different? Well, they cook it PERFECTLY. It might sound weird, but a lot of placers cant good a burger right. Its so juicy and tender. The cheese, aioli, onions....even the bread are just so amazing. Oh, not to mention the potatoes. Ugh. Excellent. The beer list is great too as I've said in the past. Even if you're not a beer lover, just ask anyone who works there and they can pair you with something great. There is a ton of great restaurants in the area....but whenever I'm looking for somewhere to eat, I always suggest Cedar Point, because I know I wont be let down with the beer and food."
8629,15,3,1,12/9/2013,"I love the idea of Cedar Point and I think they designed the space really well. I am not a huge fan of the menu. If you're not into red meat, soy, or fried food than there's not much to eat! The beer menu on the other hand is delightful, I have had a few beers here I enjoyed."
7919,15,4,1,12/6/2013,"Good beer, decent food, nice interior. I had the burger, it wasn't mind-blowing but I enjoyed it. Kev had the catfish poboy, he thought it could use a bit more of a kick, the flavor was a tad lacking. ˜Service was quick, efficient, and friendly. I'd go back and try the chicken and waffles."
8630,15,5,1,12/3/2013,I really like this place. ˜It is classy and they have good customer service. ˜The menu is well designed and has several vegan/vegetarian options. ˜I had the vegan buffalo wings and they were pretty good. ˜My boyfriend had the jambalaya and he enjoyed it. ˜It also came with a nice cornbread. ˜I recommend this place for a nice dinner.
8631,15,5,1,12/2/2013,"I've eaten here plenty of times since my last review. ˜Everything's been terrific, from the pumpkin hummus to the vegan biscuits and gravy. ˜Loving this place more and more with every visit. ˜And the inventiveness and attention to creative detail is hot and sexy. ˜Do you really think it's just coincidence that the famed New Orleans libation the Sazerac is the Tuesday drink special?? ˜No, I know these folks better than that - they chose that day of the week in honor of the one Tuesday a year that is especially celebratory in Nola: Mardi Gras.. and this Fat Tuesday, I took full advantage of the $5-but-tastes-like-$12 absinthe-rinsed-rye-and-sugar-cube-cocktail (which, yes, is $5 EVERY Tuesday.. a wonderful thing.. and the Old Fashioneds are $5 on Thursday.. dangerous). ˜Anyway, last night, a buddy and I celebrated the holiday with one of the tastiest morsels of meat I've eaten in ages - the ""Blackened Gator on a Stick"" - followed by an order of the vegan wings, which were better than ever (still $5 per order from 6-7pm and 10pm-12am Tues-Fri, as are the ""normal"" wings; either is slathered in an epic hot sauce and served with a helping of Brussels). ˜It was downright satisfying to hear my man Ben, a full-on meat eater with a care only for what his food tastes like and little else, say that the sauce was out-of-this-world and the wings tasted better than any ""actual"" chicken wing he'd had in a while. ˜And the service rocks. ˜If I lived in Fishtown, this would be my regular spot."
8632,15,2,1,11/16/2013,"We have been here 3 times and every time they have disappointed us. ˜Today we had brunch and the Creole eggs were a mess and the biscuits and gravy were awful. ˜There was a vegan sausage that tasted like a piece of hardened mud. ˜ I mean Trader Joe's vegan meatballs have more moisture. ˜ The biscuits themselves were good. I am not really a snob about this stuff. The first time I had the Ruben. It was not toasted and the fries weren't great. The second time I had the seitan wings. Not good. I was expecting something like Belgian Cafe, but what I got felt like the gristle from the fried seitan covered in buffalo sauce. There are just too many great places in Fishtown to warrant mediocrity."
8633,15,5,1,11/5/2013,"Remeber that time you got everything you've ever wanted in a sandwich? If the answer is yes, that means you've already eaten at Cedar Point. If the answer is no, then haul your ass down to Fishtown and get yourself the GRILLED CHEESE WITH PULLED PORK ON IT!!!!!!! Service was great, drinks were great, everything was great. But seriously... that sandwich though!"
8634,15,4,1,11/2/2013,I came to support a friends happy hour fundraiser and had a great time. ˜Not sure if I would of ended up here if I didn't but I am so glad she invited me. ˜I defiantly want to come back here to try the food the menu looked amazing. But I was there to drink and the draft list rocked. ˜They have an awesome patio and I loved the bar area it got a little packed but it was manageable.
8635,15,5,1,10/25/2013,"Chef Shannon has done it again. Did you love A Full Plate? Of course you did. Beer + A Full Plate, sprinkled with huge ambition = Cedar Point. I have so much to say, but instead I will focus simply on one dish: the chicken and waffles. I have had chicken and waffles all over the city, but nothin is quite like this. The rich, maple dressing has a kick of unexpected spice. The waffles is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken is effing perfect. Juicy juicy juicy and tender. Crunchy Crunchy Crunchy on the outside. I cannot recommend highly enough. Beer good. Great, inventive cocktail menu. From the out-there to the classics, it is done well. Philly is great for a lot of things, but a good cocktail is hard to find sometimes. And I know a good Manhattan/Old Fashioned/Whiskey Sour. Cedar Point nails 'em. When Cedar Point opened, it dealt with a lot of BS reviews and was really dragged through the coals in terms of snap judgments. Lesser spots and owners with thinner skin might not have made it 6 months the way Cedar Point was treated. I have been here about 5 times since its roll out and every time, it just gets better and better. I think its time for everyone to eat their words, literally. (One last detail- that review earlier that mentioned ""Morningstar"" veggie meat.... yeah... not true. Its made in-house. So there.)"
8636,15,5,1,10/24/2013,"I just moved into Fishtown a month ago and came across cedar point while out on a run.... ˜While looking for ""happy hours"" in the area a week later I stopped in and was wowed by the service food and drink. This Low key gem has a phenomenal, ever-changing draft (and daily specials) list with obscure (and high in alcohol %) selections that last as long as the keg does. Their foodie-friendly specials coupled with an eclectic everyday menu is sure to entice every taste bud. Surely now one of my favorite spots. Salute and Bon appetite!"
8637,15,4,1,10/21/2013,"I do like this place. ˜Last time I was there I had the kale salad with the cherries and squash. ˜The dried cherries were great. ˜The place was clean, our server was friendly and accommodating and my friend who had the short ribs special and the buttermilk dessert raved about her dishes. ˜The vegan wings were way too heavy and I won't order them again but the Brussels sprouts were Delish! This is a place I would gladly gladly go back in a heartbeat if they added the vegan cheese plate back. ˜There is like no where in Philly to get a nice glass of wine w a vegan cheese plate and maybe some fig Jam and mustard - that made them unique! ˜I feel like that is a great dish for all seasons, and if they wanted to make it more fall-ish they could do a smokey sweet potato pŸt? along w the cheeses. Either way I've eaten here multiple times and have never had a bad meal - though I have not had the kale burger people are all tangled up about. ˜The brioche bun seems not vegan even though the menu says vegan. ˜I'm sure if I ordered it I would ask for clarification. Give this place a shot and see for your self. It seems that the reviews are all over the place- but that makes sense kind of bc one restaurant can't really be everything to all the people of fishtown now, can it?"
8638,15,5,1,10/16/2013,"Great beer on tap at a great price. Had a bunch of small plates and a burger, which was very good. I even liked the Vegan food that we ordered. I never thought I'd love brussel sprouts. Even my 6 year old ate them!!!"
8639,15,3,1,10/6/2013,"Cedar Point is the restaurant I want to love, but just can't. The beer selection is always fantastic and I'll keep coming here as long as my laundromat is across the street...but the food, I just can't do. I tried one of their vegetarian options at brunch and admit that I erred in going for one with a fake meat option...but there are so many places that do this well that I had hope. What'd I get? A couple of biscuits with Morningstar vegetarian sausage, covered with an admittedly decent gravy, and a healthy dose of regret. On subsequent visits I've tried their mac & cheese (ok, yes, this is good), their pumpkin soup (tasty but someone went overboard on the spicing - prepare to spend the entire meal blowing your nose), the kale burger (on which, more below), and a falafel plate (confusingly, served with no pita - so an hour later, I was ready to eat again). The kale burger is the item that most baffles me. Every time I've been in Cedar Point someone's devouring this thing; after a couple months wondering what was so great about the burger, I broke down and ordered it. I was disappointed in every way. The kale burger is just what it sounds like - a kale patty that doesn't taste like much (except kale) and doesn't come close to a solid burger consistency (instead, consistency of mushed kale). Adding insult to the whole thing, the burger held together so poorly that every bite sent a little more of the patty crumbling onto the plate, so that before every bite I had to open the bun, fork the patty back in, and repeat. The root chips on the side could have, should have, been delicious, but the salt was so poorly distributed that I ate tasteless chip after chip, until finding the three that took the brunt of the salting. Really, I don't know what else to say. Most of the food has been a disappointment, but of a generally predictable variety - because, really, who expects a kale burger to taste good? Who thinks that vegetarian biscuits and gravy is a good idea? My best advice is to explore the beer menu and to assume that any menu item that sounds too good to be true definitely is, and that execution errors will mar even the safer options. On the plus side, the servers have always been pretty on top of things, and they have that deck."
8640,15,5,1,10/5/2013,"This!! This is what spots all over the country are trying to get right... but Ceder Point NAILS IT!! First night back in town in a long time. My buddies brought me here and they WON!! The beer selection was just fantastic. The outdoor setting was wonderful. They sat us and served us, in a light drizzle, which shows both dedication and class. I had a bowl of wings with pan fried Brussels Sprouts and WTF, it changed my life. I will be back, but you, you reading this, you will go there now and just give them your money. They will make you drunk, full of food, and very happy!!"
8641,15,4,1,9/27/2013,"I don't understand the negative reviews. I live just down the street from this place and go pretty often. The food is always delicious; the craft beers are always a good selection; and I've only once gotten less than awesome service. Their food main menu is small, but to me that means they've got it streamlined so everything is up to par. And they always have a new specials list. There isn't a single thing I've ordered that hasn't been at the very least satisfying. And their beer - it's always a great selection. I'm definitely a wheat beer fan, so it's nice to know that if I don't want anything on their rotation, they always seem to have Allagash. And honestly, there was only one time where the service wasn't as attentive as I thought it could have been. It wouldn't have really bothered me, but I was out with family, and I wanted them to think this place was as great as I think it is. They have outdoor seating, a charming indoor dining room, and prices I think are more than reasonable. I really like this place, and I wish those who didn't have a great experience might give it another shot."
8642,15,3,1,9/19/2013,Nice place for drinks on the patio but food is hit or miss. I love Kale but unfortunately the Kale burger that was recommended by the server was more than disappointing.
8643,15,3,1,9/13/2013,"hit or miss? the misses aren't horrible wrecks, just nothing to want again. I had a great burger with chicken fried bacon which was a tad salty even for bacon. PoBoy softie was a little baby crab on a huge roll. more like a bread sandwich but tasted ok nonetheless. turkey rueben was eh. the side of brussels were good. I was charged extra for a flight of beer and nowhere does it say that was going to happen. staff is friendly. I'll try it again due to convenience and the depth of the menu, but hoping for more out of the place"
6988,15,5,1,9/10/2013,"I know that this place had a rough start, so I waited until September to go, figuring they have worked out the 'rough spots' and it seems that they have. ˜I have eaten there twice and was very pleased both times. I ate their 'root chips', 'mini cabbage' and 'beet ravioli' . All of those were fantastic and I hope they keep them on the menu. Service and ambiance is also en point. ˜ My only complaint: ˜when I tried to take a bite of my husband's wings that he had ordered, I was overwhelmed with the smell of white vinegar (Blehghgh!). ˜ I wish they would switch to apple cider vinegar as white vin is what I use to clean my house. If white vinegar consumption doesn't bother you like it does me, then order their wings. ˜ Anyhow, the drinks selection is also excellent!"
8644,15,3,1,8/22/2013,"Have only been here 4 times, beer selection great and house wine good. The Bloodmary I had this past Sunday which was made with ˜house vodka very good. Enjoyed my brunch much more this visit then I did for the last 3 lunchs I have had here which I thought were average, order the Brussels Sprout Salad and got a bowel of sauted ˜Brussels Sprouts(not what I call a salad), plus core was still in brussels sprout. ˜ Well return for brunch again and will try the dinner menu one of these days."
8645,15,4,1,8/15/2013,"As a city dweller, I have a handful of go-to restaurants that I can rely on for a Friday night when I want nothing more than to decompress from work with delicious food in my belly and a quick trip back home. Cedar Point is on that list. The first few times I went, it was a little so-so. But they are a new restaurant and still working out some kinks, and it was REALLY close to home, so I persisted. Then came the day I ordered the seitan veggie wings. I do not exaggerate when I say they blew my mind for a number of reasons. For one, I do not, I repeat DO NOT eat spicy food. Especially buffalo sauce. But some weird restaurant voodoo took hold of me one day and on a whim I ordered them. They burned the everloving hell out of my mouth, but by god were they delicious. They also come with perfectly cooked brussel sprouts that offer a quick and small reprieve from the spicy hot inferno bought on by the wings. Since the first time I had them, I've learned that you can ask for light sauce, or even get the sauce on the side, and it has only made the experience better. Since they make each batch of sauce in-house, sometimes it's spicier than others, and once a waiter was even kind enough to give me some milk when I couldn't take it anymore. Now that they have had some time to get their legs under them, the food, especially veggie entrees, are bangin. I am a huge fan of the ""meatball"" sub they've had on the specials list a few times, and the BBQ mushroom grilled cheese is very tasty. They always have good craft beers on tap, and I hardly ever have to wait too long for a table. This place is definitely worth a trip, especially if you're on the fence. The wait staff is friendly and willing to make your meal a good experience, and if you're a vegetarian you'll be in heaven with all the options!"
8646,15,4,1,8/14/2013,A few friends of ours were not happy with the food snd service so my family and I decided to waltz in on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Everything looked appetizing. Settled on the specials of chocolate chip banana walnut French toast and baked creole melt and cornbread. The cornbread could've used more oomph. And the coffee could've been more hot. But they replaced the coffee with no complaints. Over all a good experience. My kids enjoyed their meal and they were prompt in getting our orders and delivering them. Would try them again for dinner service.
8647,15,2,1,8/11/2013,"I've given this place a few chances due to their deck and proximity to my house. ˜But they just can't seem to get it together. ˜Out of all of the food I've had there, I only remember what I had once. ˜And that's because their chicken & waffles were pretty gross. ˜""Fried Chicken"" is not breaded chicken tenders. ˜That is chicken that happens to have been fried. ˜And their maple-bbq sauce is so sickeningly sweet that I couldn't finish the meal. ˜It's just...no. ˜It's a no. ˜Too much competition from much better places within walking distance to bother going back for another chance."
8648,15,3,1,8/9/2013,"Went here last night with a friend who has been raving about this place for a bit. I'm a huge fan of Loco Pez across the street, and always noticed this location vacant, wondering why someone would build such a nice place without a tenant. I moved away from Fishtown and hadn't been back to Loco Pez for a while, but on my most recent visit, I saw Cedar Point, totally full to the door, on a weeknight. I know this area is up and coming, I lived here and saw it happening, but I didn't expect them to get a restaraunt in there, and have a wait list of over an hour on a weeknight in less than three months time. This was pretty intriguing to me. When we got there last night, there was a crowd, but it was manageable, my friend and I got a table right next to the bathroom, which was a bit unpleasant, based on the layout of this place, it's kind of an odd decision to place tables so close to the bathroom. From my seat, I had to watch people come in and out of the bathroom the whole time I was there, a little weird. The service here was decent, I have no complaints about it. However the food was kind of boring. I know it's comfort food/BBQ, but the burger I had was really bland, and there was a sauce of some kind in it, but I could not taste it at all. The fries were okay, but not crispy, kind of flabby, I had high expectations based on what my friend described. I had a cocktail, and while it was a bit pricey, it was pretty good. Place is pretty affordable, and the atmosphere, other than the table next to the bathrooms, is pretty decent. I'd go here again but probably only if it's dollar taco night at Loco Pez, and they're so packed I can't even get in the door."
8649,15,5,1,8/2/2013,"This place is amazing. ˜I went there for the first time yesterday and we arrived 15 minutes before happy hour, and they didn't pressure us to order before HH started so that was a nice way to begin everything. ˜ We ordered the vegan wings and a grilled artichoke and spinach salad that was a special for the evening. ˜The food was AMAZING!!! ˜I have attempted to follow a vegetarian lifestyle for the past few months, but I have this terrible weakness for buffalo wings. ˜So when my friend brought me here to try their vegan wings, I am happy to say they were way better than I ever expected them to be! ˜ The protein was like the crunchy pieces from real chicken wings and mixed with brussel sprouts and it was served with an apricot horseradish sauce. ˜I admit the sauce sounded like an odd choice but when you try it all together...phenominal. The salad was this delicate, delicious mix of grill artichoke hearts (which slightly warmed the dressing, and it was lovely), baby spinach, capers, red onions, and a citrus vinaigrette. ˜I recommend this salad as great option for sharing before jumping into the other yummy food. ˜ The happy hour times are great for people who are traveling from a distance (like myself) who want good food at reasonable prices. ˜They had a great selection of beer that was part of HH, and overall this was a very satisfying experience. ˜I will be back, and hopefully often!"
8650,15,3,1,7/29/2013,"Not sure if I should give 2 or 4 stars...let me explain. ˜The first time I ate here they had just opened a week prior and they were still working out the kinks, hence the 2 stars, then I went back a month or 2 later and had the Burger (beef) which was delicious but the service was mediocre. ˜Then a few weeks later the wife and I were hungry late at night (about 11 pm) and decided to go again and had great service but the food the wife ordered was not very good (some weird grilled cheese...that was a mess...they took it off the bill and brought her the beet raviolis that she loves) my food was delicious. ˜ We then went again this morning for lunch and we both ordered the BLT with Turkey Bacon (very chewy...and not too tasty), I got a side salad and the wife ordered fries (which are usually good but today they were extremely greasy...the oil must not have been hot enough and soaked into the fries). ˜ So I am torn on what kind of a rating to give this place...we will go back but it probably won't be at the top of the list."
8651,15,2,1,7/28/2013,"My friends dragged me out to this place during the heat wave. I wasn't feeling so good so I decided to go light and ordered the kale and white bean burger. I love kale and white beans but I'm not really sure what the deal was here. Do they think this is what vegan food is supposed to be? Mushy, bland, and ill conceived. Everyone else ordered the real burgers and they thought they were OK. The beer was fine...service was whatever."
8652,15,2,1,7/26/2013,"I have visited here three times and every time I left feeling disappointed. The servers are lackadaisical, the food is not very good and their happy hour is not worth the trip. The servers are slow and not very friendly. I was not given share plates after my food arrived, and our waters were not refilled....ever. While sitting at the bar once the servers and bartenders just leaned on the counter at the end using their cell phones. They carried on conversation talking loudly and laughing not acknowledging customers who had just sat. They offer a dollar or two off of drafts during happy hour and only one dollar off of wines, which are already priced at $8 so not really a deal. There are no food discounts during happy hour- not even just at the bar As another reviewer mentioned, the menu descriptions completely exaggerate what actually comes out of the kitchen. The food is mediocre, boring and completely over priced."
8653,15,2,1,7/24/2013,"I was excited to try this place. My husband and I are vegan and their menu had not just vegan options but very creative ones. Vegan cheese board! Vegan French toast! We arrived at 5:45 on a Saturday evening with our baby--early enough so it wouldn't be too crowded. One of the staff greeted us and was very friendly. Although there were many tables available, there weren't any that would seat 4 (we had another couple with a baby coming to meet us) plus babes comfortably until another table got up. The staff member said the wait would be fifteen mins but by the time we were seated, it was a half hour later. Not his fault but I wish we hadn't waited as long. We ordered the veggie wings, fava tots and vegan cheese board as apps and three of the four of us ordered the kale burger for dinner. I thought the veggie wings were great and the addition of roasted Brussel sprouts was nice. Fava tots were nice too--one of our party loved them. The vegan cheese board was pretty terrible. Now, before you go saying that, of course it was terrible--it's vegan! Let me say this: one, vegan cheeses have come a long way and any decent vegan cookbook or food blog has way tastier cashew-based cheese recipes with just a few wholesome ingredients. Beyond that, if something doesn't taste or look good, vegan or not, don't serve it at your restaurant! The board consisted of two vomitous lumps and two strips of tofu. That's not cheese! Seriously, check out the book Vegan Artisan Cheese for delectable examples. Cedar Point definitely gets points for trying but they haven't perfected their recipes or presentation and need to take this item off the menu until they do. The kale burger was virtually seasonless, mushy and totally fell apart. Again, I've had good veggie burgers and bad ones and this was bad. And again, any run of the mill vegan cookbook would have provided a better recipe. Service was fast and friendly but I'm afraid I won't be returning, especially since I also had stomach issues all night and this morning after my meal. Vegans do have eyes and taste buds and while I totally appreciate adding vegan menu items, dishes should be tested, tasty and presentable before making it to the menu. There are too many other vegan and nonvegan restaurants in the city doing better to settle for anything less."
8654,15,3,1,7/3/2013,"Came here because the Mexican spot in the other corner was packed. Why no signage outside? ˜Is it supposed to be secret? Anyway we sat outside, got some drinks and took in the menu. The corn dog sounded good, but it was tiny and wasn't corn dogged fully because it wasn't fully enclosed. I thought it would be great but I didn't even finish it because I didn't like it. Got the kale burger in hopes of redemption and that was alright for a hulk green patty. Though the waiter forgot about us for a while, he was super friendly and profusely apologized and comped some drinks."
8655,15,4,1,6/28/2013,"Great decor, ˜great beer list, lots of veggie/vegan options. We thought the vegan wings over brussel sprouts were tasty and inventive, also meant to be eaten with a fork, so less messy. We also had the BEST beer ever, some kind of sour cherry ale. Truly unique. Fries, outstanding. I had open-faced tuna, which was balanced and well-seasoned. We went mid-week, mid-day so I can't complain about the service like some folks did, but maybe give this place some time to come into its own. It's got ""potential"" written all over it. If they're are kinks, I have a feeling, they'll work them out."
8656,15,5,1,6/26/2013,"I've been here many times and have only sat at the bar, so keep that in mind with my review. Cedar Point has become one of my ""go-to""s since they have opened. There is always an available seat (or three) at the bar whenever I've gone, which is anywhere from a Sunday afternoon, Saturday night, or a Wednesday at like 4:00. The beer list is always changing and is quite extensive. There has always been something I like or something I want to try. As for food- I have had the burger, (real) wings, mac and cheese, pulled pork mac and cheese, and their special burger with the chicken-fried bacon and jalapeno chutney. I would absolutely order everything again, though I love the wings. They are cooked perfectly, have a nice kick to them, and they come with brussel sprouts- a combination I would have never thought of, but they work together perfectly. The bartenders are always super friendly and attentive and the food comes out quickly. I definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't already."
7688,15,3,1,6/25/2013,"I've been here several times since they first open, and Cedar Point has ˜a spotty record. ˜I've been impressed by the taplist on some visits, underwhelmed other times. ˜The service is likewise; sometimes great, other times...not so much. ˜The canned beer sometimes offers the best deal and selection (ie: Torpedo IPA and Six Point pounders for $5). For food, the brunch offerings are solid, but small portions. ˜They're priced appropriately, but for me, I don't want to go out to brunch and need another meal in two hours. ˜I've heard other people rave about the burger, but when I visited mine was dry and overcooked. ˜Overall, the menu is pub fare on a health kick. ˜Definitely try the root chips. The outdoor space, and really the whole interior, are great, and I think this spot is a positive addition to the neighborhood. ˜I love late night happy hour and daily lunch. Bottom Line: ˜Hit or miss. ˜Cedar Point needs to pull a lot of details together in order to become a Fishtown staple."
8657,15,5,1,6/24/2013,"Why did it take me so long to come here?! ˜Cedar Point is awesome for any number of reasons but these take the cake: Veggie wings, huge deck, great (and unusual) beer selection. ˜Veggie wings are the best I've had - served with an apricot dipping sauce and brussel sprouts. ˜So good. ˜The best. ˜ We ended up here on a Thursday night around 930 and were seated immediately, had great service, and tried some really unique beers. ˜I stole a bite of the chicken and cornbread waffles served with some spicy bbq sauce and it was phenomenal. ˜It was so good that I'd consider ditching my beloved veggie wings next time But wait, it gets better. ˜For people like me who don't make it out to dinner until late they offer a killer happy hour from 10-12 M-F. ˜Can't wait to go back here."
8658,15,3,1,6/22/2013,"We went here last night, and it was a pretty good experience. The service was decent, and beer selection was good, but the food was a different story. It took a long time to get the food, and while it was tasted good, was also a bit expensive for what you got. I had the chicken and waffle which was 2 boneless fried chicken pieces over a waffle then slathered in BBQ sauce. I liked it, but it wasn't delicious, and at $13 a bit pricey. ˜My husband had the catfish po'boy, and he thought it was very good, and his only complaint was that there were too many pickles on the sandwich. He loves pickles but had to remove some there were so many. This place shows promise and we would probably check it out again."
8659,15,3,1,6/12/2013,"As a Loco Pez regular, I enjoyed watching the slow construction of Cedar Point over the course of the last year. It was with no lack of excitement that I visited the restaurant a week after it's grand opening. The best way I know to describe the experience was that despite high levels of promise, what resulted was very mediocre execution. The food is OK at best and undoubtedly overpriced. Service is very lacking. It's clear that they hired folks without service backgrounds, especially at the bar. One time at the bar I watched the bartender spill part of my (expensive) cocktail then proceed to top of the drink with water. Very disappointing. Interior decor is very ""meh"", especially if you get stuck in the back section away from the windows/deck. I still go to Cedar Point occasionally for drinks on their sweet outdoor deck, but only due to the fact that I live a few blocks away. Otherwise, I'd not bother making the trip."
8660,15,2,1,6/6/2013,"On a nice evening where the wait to get in at Loco Pez was 30 plus minutes, the crew and I decided to try the welcoming deck attached to Cedar Point Restaurant. The service was spotty yet friendly but the menu choices seemed to be a confusion of vegetarian inspired Louisiana style with weird northeastern influences. We opted for the Lobster Roll Sliders as an appetizer....this was an entr?e special but was well portioned for the task at hand. Shredded small pieces of not too fresh, overly dressed lobster on a very nice brioche bun. ˜Bigger fresher chunks with less dressing would have made these very nice indeed. My wife had the Jambalaya. She said that it was bland dirty rice with a few pieces of andouille sausage. My chicken salad sandwich was ok but nothing to write home about. Our friend got what appeared to be on the menu a stuffed cheese and pulled pork sandwich...there was nothing stuffed or extraordinary about pulled pork on dark bread. I can see the potential here, and with a little more focus I'm sure that they can get it together."
8661,15,4,1,6/2/2013,"Awesome place! ˜Walked by this vacant restaurant for a long time, always looked like an awesome deck. So happy this place has finally become a great place to eat outside and have a nice drink on a warm summer night!"
8662,15,3,1,5/31/2013,"An update to my previous (2 star) review. My second visit was nicer than the first, with lovely weather and a spot on the deck. The food was a tiny bit better the second time around, with a vegan cheese plate and mac and cheese shared to favorable, if not raving, reviews. The service and atmosphere have improved, and one owner contacted me about my initial experience, which I appreciate. Overall, the food here is still just ok, and this will never be my favorite place to eat. I recommend for drinks only."
8663,15,2,1,5/29/2013,Went twice. ˜Both times inside was pretty empty and a few servers were standing at the bar talking. ˜Took at least 10 or 15 min for one to come over. ˜Food was pretty mediocre. Definitely not up to the neighborhood standard. UPDATE: To be fair I don't check my yelp account quite often and after writing this review one of the owners of CP reached out to me for further particulars on the experience. ˜I do always respect an establishment owner who is willing to listen to a hard review and use it to better their place of business. ˜While I haven't been back to eat since I have stopped by for drinks on the deck a few times and had a pretty good experience.
8664,15,5,1,5/19/2013,"We were from out of town and we found this great little place. The fried green tomato po boy was the best I ever had. Definitely a fresh, yummy, southern food place."
8665,15,5,1,5/18/2013,"Excellent beer choices, laid back ambience, eclectic foodie selection of munchies and helpful wait staff. I've been back several times and not been disappointed."
8666,15,4,1,5/18/2013,The food was on point I suggest chicken and waffles! Beer selection was great and enjoyed the late night happy hour. Was disappointed that they closed their deck very early on such a beautiful night. Our server was snotty and just threw the drink menu at my guest when he asked nicely to leave it. Overall cool vibe and I don't mind chillen out there.
8667,15,5,1,5/17/2013,"I took the family here last night for dinner. We were greeted and seated promptly and given menu's. We met the owner Anthony who was very knowledgeable with beers and wine. My wife was not sure what wine to drink so he brought her samples of pinot grigio ˜to try, which i thought was awesome. i had a pint of Bells Two Hearted ale which was delicious. We ordered burgers for the kids which were perfectly cooked and came with sweet potato and regular fries(nice touch). My wife and I shared the cheeseball salad, Lima beans and beet ravioli all of which were fantastic! I must say our whole experience was great from service to food and drinks. Great addition to Fishtown...Great job! BTW, they have a great deck for outdoor dining!"
8668,15,3,1,5/15/2013,"After two dinners and one late night happy hour, I feel qualified to pass public judgment, errr...write a review of this place. I'm still sad to do it, because I was hoping to be able to rate higher. The first time I visited was just about one month after Cedar Point opened. It was a Saturday evening around 6pm. My friend and I had to hunt down the one guy carrying a clipboard (he was quite fast and evasive), and almost pin him against the wall in order to put our name on the list for a table. Once that was done, we grabbed a couple of drinks from the bar and hung out awkwardly in the only place we could find to stand...for about an hour. It seemed like there was one waiter for the entire, massively packed place. We finally were seated right in the middle area, where it was deafening. We ordered a couple more drinks, then seeing how slowly they were coming out, a couple of appetizers each, assuming that everything would take a while and we might as well nibble as we tried to catch up over the din. Seriously, what is up with the acoustics in this place? It's like a concert hall for hipster screeching. The food was also atrocious (veggie wings were more like a chewy soup... cold, hard tofu dip?, awful and tough oily chips, ouch). The lonesome server was nice but overwhelmed. I regretted the whole thing. The second visit, about 3 weeks later: I came here with two other girls for a weekday dinner around 7pm. We waited about 20 minutes and were seated outside on the lovely deck (which lacks good lighting or heat lamps - it got chilly pretty quickly). It appeared that they had doubled the wait staff for the restaurant, but we were still promptly forgotten after being seated. About 30-45min after ordering, we got our meals: my friends enjoyed their BBQ grilled cheeses, and my sandwich was just okay. We would have liked to, but weren't able to get another round of drinks before finishing our meal, thanks to the absentee server of the year. Third visit: 10pm on a weeknight. A nice surprise, late night happy hour! For once, the place wasn't packed. The bartender was super friendly and relatively attentive. The draft list was fabulous. Our sweet potato fries hit the spot. My friend and I thoroughly enjoyed this visit. With service and food so downright disappointing and unpredictable. I'll be tucking this spot into my file of local late night happy hours, and absolutely nowhere else, for the moment."
8669,15,5,1,5/15/2013,"After my third great meal at Cedar Point, I decided it was time to let others know how awesome this place is. Had brunch a few weeks back, the Meat Loaf Eggs Benedict was delicious. Made my last two visits at dinner time. The grilled cheese pulled pork sandwich is definitely my favorite, the slaw is perfectly crisp and sweet next to the spice of the meat. I could eat it everyday. This past weekend I tried a couple of the daily specials, a filet tip sandwich and crab claw cocktail. The cocktail sauce for the crab claws was so good I considered asking for a shot of vodka to make a drink out of the leftover sauce. And the filet tip sandwich that could have just been ordinary was literally ramped up, topped w saut?ed ramps and blue cheese. Delicious. Both sandwiches came w fries, which I loved from Full Plate and still love here. And Amy makes a great Margarita, for us non-beer drinkers. Can't wait until my next visit, I'm going to try something on the veg side of menu...vegetarian chicken croquettes. Sounds interesting."
8670,15,4,1,5/15/2013,"What I love here are the small plates. Lots of vegan options, quick service and delicious food. If you aren't careful you can rack up quite a bill in no time, but the servings are healthy and ... topping seitan wings with brussel sprouts... GENIUS! This is a must attend for phila phoodies."
8671,15,5,1,5/14/2013,"OMGosh! Ok, they have a late night happy hour which is soooo cool but I need to mention the food. I have been to this establishment several times and had so many good things. ˜The fried pickles are my fave but the tuna melt and beet ravioli was also delish. The service staff is always great and quirky which makes it a fun night or brunch out every time :) I haven't gotten the chance to sit outside on that beautiful deck but I am looking forward to it this summer."
8672,15,1,1,5/14/2013,I tried it again - self punishment - just sucks!
8673,15,4,1,5/14/2013,"Having been here a number of times, I can comfortably say that the place easily deserves four stars. ˜I've been seated at tables and at the bar, as a couple and with a larger group, and have always been pleased with the service and the staff. ˜The food is equally good and I recommend the pulled portabella sandwich (this is the first place that has made the vegetarian food flavorful enough for me to choose it over options). ˜ Highly recommend."
8674,15,2,1,5/13/2013,"i want to like cedar point. ˜it's a new bar just blocks from my house in a neighborhood clamoring for newness, has comfortable outdoor deck seating, what seems to be a decent menu and best of all... an uncanny friday night happy hour. but then there's the food which just falls completely flat. also, some very odd aesthetic choices inside regarding the wall colors... ?? *fried green tomato po boy - super thick (because they were breaded - wtf?) slices of green tomato on a gigantic bulky roll with not much else on it. *reuben - untoasted bread (derp) with reasonably dry turkey and not quite enough cheese/slaw/mustard. bbq grilled cheese - sounds like the best and worst idea at the same time. ˜there's way too much happening here to have it be good. ˜complete overkill. fried pickles - too small an order. fries - good. ˜crisp yet still soft at center with a nice mix of white and sweet potatoes. pan-sizzled greens - just ok. ˜pretty hard to get wrong. i gave them 2 tries and i'm sure i'll give them at least one or two more later on in the summer when i'm ready to hit up that sweet sweet deck. ˜i wish i could leave an extra half-star because of said deck and happy hour! ˜oh well."
6591,15,5,1,5/13/2013,"This place is excellent. Brunch for all of us was AMAZING. Best waffle i ever had. Cheese onion grits were insane and the bacon was prime thick cut grilled to perfection. ˜Everything was fresh, hot and came fast. The staff was very nice and totally open to substitutions / changes with no problems at all. ˜They were into the food and very knowledgeable of the menu. Seems to be pretty well run, not just some budget ditsy hipster cafe like some in the area."
8675,15,1,1,5/12/2013,"Bad food and even worse service. I made the mistake of suggesting this for mothers day brunch based off of word of mouth - bad choice. We waited almost 45 minutes for our food, which we assumed meant it was because they were making it extra delicious - WRONG. Undercooked, sloppy, and we never once got our waters refilled. While our server was nice enough to apologize for our wait, it didn't come close to making up for our experience. Ill stick to Loco Pez when in that area."
8676,15,2,1,5/11/2013,"I had the cheesy grits last weekend-They WERE NOT GRITS. I think someone made them with cornflour instead of grits. The texture was way off and they tasted chalky and terrible. Everything on the menu sounds tasty and well conceived, ˜but after eating there twice and trying 7 or 8 dishes, I'm sorry to say, the chef/cooks don't have the skill to execute. ˜The place is very nice and comfortable, and the service is friendly-Beer selection and prices are good as well, lets hope the food catches up to the rest of the place."
8677,15,1,1,5/6/2013,"I've tried. Went there twice took other couples, four different dishes each time, each a disappointment. ˜Late night happy hour is great, patio is great, service is great. ˜Kitchen zero stars so far. ˜I may agree with rest , maybe in a few months? ˜Looks great on paper but doesn't deliver."
8678,15,4,1,5/5/2013,"I went when it was empty so can't speak for the wait. Was a big, big A Full Plate fan so had high hopes. The renovation is definitely great. The atmosphere is ideal for a bar. I would like to be at a place like this every night, just on vibe/decor alone. My favorite at A Full Plate was promptly ordered: The Turkey Sandwich. They been really lax on the portion of cranberry aioli lately, so I asked for extra! A must. So I got to say, they changed this sandwich a ton which was sad. Used to be a ridiculous portion of turkey and the bacon was curled and crispy, but not it was more just like a slab of thin/fried ham. Still an excellent sandwich though, but if you had the previous one from A Full Plate, you could be disappointed. Other than that, Grilled Cheese and a Tuna Melt to die for. The fries also, amazing. Order the grilled cheese and tuna melt and split both with your date/friend. You will be so happy you listened to me that you will want to meet me and buy me a free meal here :)"
7104,15,2,1,4/27/2013,"Last night my husband and I tried out Cedar Point. We had very high hopes - it's a couple blocks from our house, the outdoor seating area looks awesome, and it's right across from Loco Pez, one of our favorite restaurants. Overall, the food was confusing. The Johnnycake Pinwheel appetizer was one giant cornbread pancake wrapped around huge pieces of brisket. It was very difficult to eat, and was quite large for an appetizer. The taste was also pretty bland. I wish they were smaller pinwheels, maybe bite sized. We also weren't given little plates to share food, so we both had to reach to and eat off of the plate it came out on. The ""fried chicken and waffle"" was made with CHICKEN TENDERS! What!?!? I was sosososo disappointed with this dish. Fried chicken is...fried chicken! I couldn't believe it was made with chicken tenders. The fried green tomato po boy was also pretty bad. There were three green tomatoes on a long roll with a little bit of spinach and some type of reddish spread, which was almost undetectable. It was on the menu as being accompanied with chipotle goat cheese...and I didn't get annnnny of that coming through on this dish. It way far too dry and bread-y. Unfortunately I can't attribute this to the kinks being worked out of a new place. The food was just plain boring and the menu descriptions glorified what actually came out of the kitchen"
8679,15,1,1,4/26/2013,"Second visit. Totally dissatisfied and kinda frustrated. Not pleased with my food...a little expensive for what it was, both times. The onion, veggie dish- $15!!!! Seems crazy...especially cuz it was just bad. I explained my disappointment to our waitress and she said ""sorry"". Hoping it gets better, but it will be a long time before I return. Sad, because I live 3 blocks away."
8680,15,2,1,4/21/2013,"So when I heard from a friend that the owners of a Full Plate opened this spot, I had high expectations. ˜A Full Plate was awesome, so I figured this would be a repeat. ˜ Let me start off by saying that it was Sunday brunch and when we walked in it was busy. ˜We had to wait about 5 minutes to sit down. ˜Our waiter was very nice, but like all the staff there they seemed to be overwhelmed. ˜ They have a good brunch menu that is VERY veggie friendly, which is great! ˜I ordered the Tofu scramble with spicy peanut sauce.. ˜The description says it comes with a side order of potatoes and theres veggies mixed in the tofu. ˜My friend got the granola and mac and cheese. ˜ They have a great beer selection in both tap, bottles, and cans. ˜They also have some cool cocktails, and wine if you're not a beer geek. ˜I tried both a beer and a cocktail. ˜The server suggested a drink and I thought was really good. ˜ Then...we sat, and sat, and SAT. ˜I included earlier in the review that the place was busy to be fair. ˜However, it was not busy enough to wait even close to as long as we had to. ˜Our server said ""sorry we're busy the kitchen is backed up."" ˜He seemed kind of humiliated that it was taking that long. ˜At first I was like ok, sure no problem. ˜We continued talking and noticed that the place was clearing out a bit so I thought the food would be out any minute. ˜The wait was the longest wait I've waited for food anywhere. ˜ Finally I flagged down my waiter and asked him where our food was. ˜He said that he was going to check on it, just as a food runner came out. ˜By this time we were kinda bummed because you never had to wait at a Full Plate and the excitement of this new place wore off after sitting for so long. ˜Then came the food. ˜Tofu scramble is basically chopped up tofu with small pieces of broccoli (no other veggies) and a SLIGHT hint of peanut sauce (nothing spicy about it.) ˜The portion of potatoes just looked plain stingy on the plate. ˜My friends mac and cheese was good, but nothing you can't find somewhere else in the city. ˜ Basically, this place was a huge let down. ˜I was such a fan of a Full Plate, I don't know what happened here. ˜I write this review in hopes that they get everything taken care of because the spot has potential and as I said is clearly creating buzz because it was so busy. ˜However, our experience was not good. ˜Loco Pez across the street will continue to be my spot."
7105,15,3,1,4/21/2013,"So I struggled between 2 and 3 stars on this one. ˜I was a HUGE fan of Cedar Point's previous incarnation, Full Plate. ˜And I can't stop thinking maybe my brunch this morning was just a one time experience, and not the norm. ˜I plan on going back for dinner/drinks to see if this place ends up being as good as I hoped it would be. So for today's brunch: Great atmosphere. ˜Well decorated. ˜The server was nice. ˜I say server, not as in my server, but as in the only server that seemed to be there. ˜I saw a couple food runners, but I didn't see anyone else taking orders or bringing checks at noon on a Sunday, which is prime brunching time. ˜I don't know if someone called out, or if the owners are just used to such a small establishment that they only think they need one sever, but more help would definitely had shot my rating up to 4 stars. That brings us to my main complaint, the wait for the food. ˜I couldn't see the kitchen, but I'm assuming they were even more understaffed there than they were in the front of the house. ˜From the time we sat down to the time we got our food was 65 minutes. ˜In the end we still didn't receive one of our side orders of cheesy grits (which were really tasty). ˜I'm not sure if they just forgot about us, because two tables that were seated after us ended up getting their food before us. ˜At any rate, I'm hoping this was a fluke, so I'm going to go back for dinner and see if service is an issue again. As for the food, I've got nothing but good things to say. ˜The menu has a ton of veggie and vegan options. ˜Our table ended up getting cheesy grits, macaroni and cheese, a homemade biscuit, the quinoa french toast, the apple cheddar french toast, the red beans and rice with andouille, and the green hash. ˜Everyone loved their food but the person who got the green hash. ˜She said it wasn't bad, just kind of boring. ˜And the tempeh bacon was bad. ˜She's a hardcore vegan lover and she hated it. ˜I tried a bite and it tasted to me exactly how dog food smells, but I'm a meat lover so maybe I'm not qualified to comment. ˜My dish, the cheddar apple french toast, was amazing. ˜And just like Full Plate, the home fries are awesome. Their beer list looked pretty awesome, and the deck looks fun. ˜I hope to return for beer and dinner on the deck. ˜I hope I can update my review then to 5 stars. Seriously though, if you only had one server on purpose, and no one called out, then rethink your scheduling ASAP."
8681,15,3,1,4/21/2013,"I definitely want to come back to Cedar Point to give it another try. We were hoping to eat here when we stopped by yesterday, but it didn't work out. We originally wanted to come by for brunch but got here a little late (about 3:15), so we figured we would get a table and have lunch. We waited about 30 min, hanging out at the bar, which was fine, as the drinks here are great (more on this later). When we finally seated, the waitress gave us a small bar menu with only a handful of items. We asked for the lunch menu, and she said that on the weekends, they don't offer a full menu in the time between when brunch ends and when dinner service begins. Uh...ok. It turns out that no one was crazy about the options on the bar menu, so we decided to leave and go to Loco Pez instead. In terms of drinks, I had a fantastic beer called the Cuvee de Jacobins (I have a policy of ordering anything related to the French Revolution). I had never seen this beer elsewhere, so was excited to try it. Their drink menu was also awesome. I can't wait to try the drink with cucumber-infused Bluecoat Gin and habanero tinctures. It sounded amazing. So just beware about the weird interstitial space between brunch and dinner if you come here on the weekend. Other than that, it seems like a great place. I will come back at a better time and report back afterward."
8682,15,2,1,4/17/2013,"It's been awhile since I've been somewhere different. We've found some local treasures and have pretty much kept to them lately. But when something opens a block from your home, with a connection to a place enjoyed previously, I'm game. In a nutshell, this place should be a solid addition to the neighborhood vegetarians and vegans. For me, not so much. The service was solid. No problem there. The menu, though slightly sparse for carnivores, was a vegetarians dream. So we found one and brought her with us. She ordered the kale burger, which she said was very good, but with a bit too much roll. It came with a choice of chips, fries, or salad. She got the salad, and enjoyed it. The special of the evening was either a soft shelled crab sandwich, or a meatloaf sandwich. Another at the table got the meatloaf, which reminded me of a brick of meat. It was not the best possible shape to be put on two pieces of nice grained bread, but a little difficult to manipulate. ˜The meatloaf itself was fine. ˜Just fine, nothing more. It came with decent fries, mixed sweet potato and regular. The fried were deemed ""ok"". The meat eaters shared a Johnnycake pinwheel, which was actually more like a cornmeal pancake/crepe with good brisket, sweet onion and pickled jalapenos. It was good, nice flavor, but not too much heat, even with the jalapeno. Two of us ordered the storied fried chicken and waffle. A heavy cornmeal waffle had three thick chicken tenders on it, and it was drenched in a hot/sweet bbq sauce. I'm not sure what the actual coating on the chicken was, but it was a tad hard, and I really didn't care for the bbq sauce at all. Too hot for my tastes. I ended up taking half of the waffle and two of the chicken pieces home for others who enjoy that For dessert, we ordered one piece of a carrot/sweet potatoe cake that was also not very good. Very, very dry. Maybe as a result of being refrigerated, but I really don't care for cold cake, even if it was moist. So all in all, if I'm going out to eat, I'm not going back there. If I'm going out to have a couple drinks and enjoy the night air, this is a nice place to go. ˜The bar is fine, with a good selection of beers, and suitable selection of wines. Four people, with lots of wine and lots of beers...tab came to $148.00"
8683,15,2,1,4/16/2013,The food was just so-so. ˜The beer selection is good but not any better than any of the other neighborhood bars. ˜I was really looking forward to this place opening but nothing here impressed me. ˜I ordered a glass of beer from the featured firkin and it was terrible. ˜I told the bartender (very nicely) that I didn't like it and wanted to order something else. ˜He quipped back that he could have told me it was terrible before I ordered it and that I should have tasted it. ˜Well why didn't you suggest I taste it before buying?? ˜And why the smart ass comment? ˜Dick. I'll continue to hang across the street at Loco Pez where the bartenders are awesome and the food is good and I'll get my craft beers elsewhere.
7112,15,3,1,4/15/2013,"stopped in, after waiting a week or so after they opened. ˜I will be back to update this. ˜The one great thing that must be said: this place is another option for vegans! ˜Im a total meat-a-tarian but my friends that are vegan are super happy to have another option in the area. ˜ The catfish po boy was too much bread, for my liking. ˜I ended up having a hoagie roll - not what I expected when I read ""brioche"". ˜The vegan flannel hash and smokey limas was great to share. ˜The beer was top notch and service good. ˜Sadly they didnt have the vegan cheese plate ready for my friend, so we'll have to come back soon."
8684,15,3,1,4/11/2013,"I've been to Cedar Point twice now - one time for brunch on their soft-opening weekend and another for dinner. The brunch experience was definitely better - the server was really helpful in helping my girlfriend create a gluten-free vegan option. My tofu scramble was good, a nice change of pace with peanut sauce. The beer selection is really great. The dinner experience was more problematic - something happened in the kitchen that caused our food to take 1.5 hours. The owner came over to explain what was up and offered us complimentary dessert - which was nice. The food itself though was a bit off and better in theory. I was stoked to get the kale burger, but in reality it was a little too much kale and bland. My gf's salad didn't seem super fresh. As others mentioned, I'll be back in a few months to see if things have worked out, because I think the spot has a tonne of potential, especially in summer months when you want to sit outside and enjoy a meal."
8685,15,4,1,4/6/2013,"A solid addition to the Fishtown area. ˜ Vegetarians: ˜Come here. ˜Their vegetarian selections are innovative and delicious. ˜Reubens, Vegan Cheese Plate, Veggie Croquettes, Veggie Wings... they have all of these plus more."
7087,15,3,1,4/6/2013,"I had a lovely experience at the packed-out bar. The first thing I noticed was the sweet deck. After which, I noticed an impressive domestic taplist with great choices from across the country, without compromising local flavor. In my opinion, it is much smarter than Kraftwork's typically B-list domestic selection. I enjoyed my Great Lakes Dortmunder, Sculpin IPA, and Goose Island Sophie quite a bit. Cassie was a great server, and Anthony the owner was warm. The fried pickles would have better been battered pickles, but they were good no less. The brisket pancake was pretty moist, but probably relied on BBQ sauce too much. In general, the menu suffers from an overuse of their good BBQ sauce, but it is forgivable. The root chips were great, so was the beet ravioli. The entrees looked impressive. The burger was solid, according to one. But the jumbalaya lacked a little flavor and depth. Our pork chop was undercooked, but returned quickly back to the table and we were supplemented with chips while we waited. The special fish was good, but also a little undercooked. The chicken and waffles were the best entree on the table. Really most chicken breast, with crispy exterior and a great sauce. A solid three stars. In Fishtown, this place is a great joint to visit. I prefer Memphis' taplist, and Johnny Brenda's food, but this is a great combo of both, and has such an authentic vibe that it is totally worth visiting."
8686,15,4,1,4/6/2013,"Hubby and I went to Cedar Point tonight. The homemade vegan cheese plate with figs, onion jam, and some sweet cashew type spread was amazing. The carmelized mushroom stuffed onion was really rich and unique, and the red flannel hash was a tasty beet concoction. The maple roasted lima beans were good, but seemed a little tough. I didn't love the root veg mash-I felt it was a tad bland, but hubby liked it. Overall, a good experience for a new restaurant. Considering they haven't been open long, it was a good experience. ˜I think the bartenders and wait staff are still learning how to navigate the place, so I won't take points off for that-yet. ˜They have a lot of vegetarian options, but they were out of 2 of them which I really hope does not turn out to be a regular thing like it was at A Full Plate."
8687,15,5,1,4/5/2013,"Cedar Point is is a great addition to the neighborhood. The menu isn't stereotypical bar food, to the contrary it's full of unique items. It's about a 50/50 split for vegetarian items and also includes a hefty handful of vegan options. ˜ ˜Since I went pretty late in the evening, I opted for a few of the ""Little Helpings"". The Red Flannel Hash, diced sweet potatoes, beets, poblanos, onions, apples, was a sweet and earthy almost christmas-y tasting combination None of the flavors overpowered the other and it was a good size portion for a $4 side. I also ordered the chili-maple limas and they were absolutely delicious. I had never been a fan of lima beans but the chili-maple glaze made them irresistible to order, perfectly cooked with a sweet and slightly spicy taste. My friend ordered the kale burger which was a good size and had a nice char, taste, and texture. Some homemade veggie burgers tend to fall apart but this was well made. He opted for a side of fries instead of root chips and they are a combination of obviously handcut sweet potatoes and white potatoes. ˜ All together it was a great meal and I'm anxious to return to try the Onion Theory."
8688,15,5,1,4/4/2013,"This might now be my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. ˜ We have been here twice. ˜First time was for brunch over the weekend and the second was tonight for dinner. ˜Both times service has been excellent, food has been beyond fabulous, and the menu selection is so good I have a hell of a time trying to decide what to order. ˜ Brunch was awesome. ˜I had the fried egg BLT and it comes with turkey bacon. ˜I was kinda sad it wasn't pig bacon, but when I got it I was not even close to being disappointed. ˜It was so freaking good. ˜My boyfriend got the tempeh reuben and he was raving about it. ˜I think its also very important to note that for some odd reason I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was one of THE BEST I've ever had. ˜Every once in a while I'll order one at brunch and 9 times out of 10 I wish I had ordered a beer - but not at Cedar Point. ˜That Bloody Mary was so legit. ˜I wish I got the bartenders name but I complimented him on how good it was and he said it made his day ;) Dinner tonight was also on point. ˜Amber was our waitress and she was on top of everything. ˜I was sucking down water like a fish and she was always back with refills. ˜We ordered the veggie wings with brussel sprouts to start and OOOOMG - they were phenomenal. ˜Amber explained to us that they make everything in the back - including the seitan that was our veggie wings. ˜I wish I could make seitan that good - we've tried, and its never anything like that. ˜She did say the chef refuses to serve bleu cheese, so they don't have it at the restaurant. ˜I personally think its nasty, but my boyfriend was sad its not an option even on request. ˜ With the incredible selection on the dinner menu I went for what I was craving - the cheese burger. ˜I know, that's not very original, but hey, if the burger is above average then you know you've got a good place. ˜Let me just say this - I'm a very huge fan of Sketch Burger in Fishtown, and I rarely order a burger anywhere because they usually can't even compare - but the burger at Cedar Point was cooked to perfection. ˜It tasted sooooo fresh (menu said it was grass fed beef) and the brioche bun was the perfect way to compliment it. ˜So yes - this place has a solid cheese burger among all of the other really great things I need to get back to try. ˜ One of the owners, Anthony, stopped by our table to say hi and introduce himself. ˜I think its really awesome that he took the time to do so. ˜I like getting to know the people opening businesses in my neighborhood and like to support the businesses - so it's nice to have a more personal introduction. ˜We told him we loved the place and will be back often. ˜I wish them a lot of luck. ˜ With all of that really great food we couldn't stop there and we ordered the mud pie dessert. ˜This was not your average bar dessert - it was really effing good, and you can tell it was freshly homemade. ˜ The menu made a mention of the local places they get their groceries - Greens Grow Farm being one of them. ˜We really like that place and I love the fact that this place makes the effort to shop locally. ˜ When the weather gets nice they will have seating out on their really nice deck - so this will be a hot spot in the Spring and Summer. ˜Can't wait to go back and bring my friends and family. ˜Welcome to Fishtown!"
8689,15,5,1,4/4/2013,"In the mysterious and whimsical land of Fishtown/Kensington, there's a bevy of delightful spots to grab a nightcap these days. Quickly asserting itself among the ranks of other crucial watering holes like Kraftwork. Memphis Taproom, El Bar, Lost Bar, Loco Pez, Johnny Brenda's, Barcade, etc. is Cedar Point. Indeed, this is one of my new favorite places to go after dark and get a beer or four. The tap selection is good. The Bottle list is, too. The food offerings are unique spins on bar fare. The night happy hour menu and drink specials really make my inner beer geek smile. Stone Arrogant Bastard for $4? Cans of Sixpoint Bengali Tiger for $3? I'll have one of each, please. And maybe a Delirium Tremens to wash it down. Follow that up with the chicken & waffles w/ BBQ maple syrup or a side of veggie wings w/ homemade blue cheese dressing and you're at cruising altitude to win at life - or at least feel like a prince for a day. My review could end there. But I'm feeling particularly effusive about this new spot, so here's more: I Went with my buddy last night for a little one on one date time. We had planned on having 'a' drink and calling it a night. But as Wednesdee nights sometimes go in this neighborhood, 7 familiar faces showed up within 15 minutes. Our server Amber (totally stellar vibesmith, BTW!) handled our group like a fucking champion. She was highly accommodating, super friendly and just downright crescent fresh. Her generous suggestions and speedy delivery of our food & drinks - coupled with a propensity to smile a lot - made us feel loved and taken care of. As we settled up on our check at the end of the night, one of the owner's (Liz) offered up a complimentary bowl of their delicious 3 cheese mac. I devoured it with conviction, adding yet another delicious morsel of food to the wonderment already working it's way through my digestive system. I stumbled out into the night with my friends - full stomachs and light hearts in tow. ""THIS is why we live here"", I quietly affirmed to myself; ""because of moments just like this one"". Thanks for facilitating such a night, Cedar Point. And thanks for adding to the smalltown magic that is, Philly."
8690,15,4,1,4/4/2013,"Welcome to the neighborhood! ˜I'm so very glad that you are walking distance from my home! The space is nice, with big windows on two sides that spill in light. ˜When you walk in there is a first room with a small bar and a few high-top tables. ˜The slightly separated back room has about ten regular tables. ˜The decor is still sparse, but when I was there I think they were discussing where to hang a few things on the walls so that might change things. ˜ Small but nicely varied beer menu - thankfully included our Kensington neighbor PBC! ˜Beers were very reasonably priced. ˜There is a full bar too from the looks of it. The menu is really nice, and is vegetarian and vegan friendly. ˜Plus they source local food, bonus points for that. ˜They have separated menus for brunch, lunch and dinner. ˜All look very promising. ˜I went for lunch and had a difficult time deciding between the catfish po'boy, the green tomato po'boy and the turkey Ruben. ˜I finally decided on the catfish, served with fries (you get to pick from fries, a salad and something else which I have now forgotten) and the mac-n-cheese for my little one. ˜The catfish was great - soft bread, crisp fish. ˜I did think that the mac-n-cheese was a bit too cheesy, so I dont think I'll get that for my daughter again. The server was nice and friendly. ˜ This is definitely a kid friendly place. ˜As I was there there was a family with a little baby and another table with a dad and his young son. ˜ There is a large raised deck too, which I am looking forward to it being open in the warm weather. ˜So I am certainly looking forward to going back."
8691,15,3,1,4/1/2013,"Decent beer selection and nice staff people but this place feels like the over-flow lot for Loco Pez (where we went first but had to leave because it was so crowded). Cedar Point had a decent crowd and we (my gf and I) were seated at the bar within a few minutes. We ordered a round of drinks, a bowl of chips and 2 meals. We got our drinks immediately but had to wait 35 minutes for any of our food to come out, including the chips. Her meal (chicken and waffle) was really good.... mine was bland (burger w/ fries). Since this place is new, we'll probably try them again in a few months."
8692,15,4,1,4/1/2013,"So happy this place is finally open! Beer list is great, a few unusual choices. I've been twice for brunch, once for post-work beers. First brunch, I had the Red Flannel Hash, which was really well seasoned, but sadly undercooked. Potatoes and beets were still a little crunchy. Second brunch around, I had the veggie biscuits and gravy, which was crazy delicious. Our food took a while to come out, though they weren't too busy yet, but they apologized and made up for it with a drink on the house. Menu is fun, lots of great vegetarian/vegan options, staff is friendly and helpful, only major downside so far has been slow service, every time."
8693,15,2,1,3/30/2013,I think once they work out the kinks they'll be a great brunch spot and yes if your a vegee or a vegie you'll be happy. ˜Give it another month or 2 before you make up your mind. The omlettes are huge and fresh... the chicken and waffles is phenom... but far and away the most original item is the banana bread french toast which of course was a weekly staple at Full Plate and is now off the specials at Cedar Point. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!! On a more personal note... Full Plate was one of my favorite brunch spots... everything was fresh and the portions were huge. ˜I couldn't wait to Cedar Point finally opened. ˜The wait staff is very friendly once you get to know them but the owners are very clique and kind of cold (unless they know you). Hipster restaurants are different then normal restaurants. In normal restaurants the owners love getting to know their regulars... they walk the restaurants and small talk with the patrons... if your meal was delayed or not made to order they'll come out and apologize... if your meal was great they'll come out to thank you. Not here. I've been to Fully Plate over 50 times and I've been to Cedar Point since they've opened and the 2 owners have never once...not once said a word to me and I tip very well. ˜Strange. Very strange. ˜And a little uncomfortable.
8694,15,2,1,3/29/2013,"First impression: Nothing new, Steven Star knock-off interior. Staff was slow to greet us. Drink menu was solid, especially for craft beer enthusiasts, only issue was that they were out of my top 2 choices. Bar tender was slow to the point I though it was their first night. They forgot to take money for drinks and had to flag them down. ˜ Tables were turned around in a respectable amount of time. Once we got to our table, almost finished an entire drink before server even made contact. Slow slow. Not overly impressed with the menu, but a vegetarian or vegan might be. I got the Reubens. I have never had a bad Reuben before, but this was an abomination unworthy of the name. Cold turkey, cheap sauerkraut, and generic Russian on paper-thin white rye. The fries had potential (potato and yam) except that they were soggy and, IMO, way under salted. The meal itself was unsatisfactory to the point that if it were not for the fact that I had just dropped 10 bucks for it, I would have left it on the plate. Tipped the server a little over 20% because he was clearly hustling. (He had broken a sweat when he brought our check.) Overall, it seemed pretty disorganized and like they were charging for quality that isn't there. I'm going to give them a few months to get their act together ˜and iron out the wrinkles before visiting again. ."
8695,16,1,0,6/22/2012,Have been ignored in there at least 3 times while the bartenders were chatting with their friends or playing on their cell phones. Got a drink in a minute at a bar around the corner!
8696,16,1,0,2/11/2012,Absolutely disgusting
8697,16,2,0,1/8/2012,"I was excited to check out my new local bar as I recently moved to the area, so I stopped by on a Friday around 9PM. I was NOT impressed. The ""famous"" wings were only OK and weren't nearly saucy enough. The bartenders were very inattentive and it seemed to take forever to get our check paid (even though there were 2 bartenders and neither seemed busy at all). The only thing I really enjoyed about this place was the cheese fries, which were pretty good. Maybe a good bar for the locals who frequent here, but not for me."
8698,16,3,0,8/7/2012,Was nice place to relax with my family.
8699,16,4,0,4/12/2013,"Had about an hour and a half to kill while i was waiting for friend to finish her class at CCP and came in here. It's one of those places that I'm sure i've been in before but couldn't remember. It was small and crowded and loud with people getting ready to play quizzo but the bartender gave me a nod right away and asked 'what can i get you love?' in a slight Irish accent. One Dogfish later I ordered the Chicken pesto sandwich, which was excellent and only $7.50!! When my food came the bartender asked 'do you have everything you need love?' (and I did!) It's a little out of my way and there are a lot of spots between my place in South Philly and here but i will be returning there the next chance i get."
8700,16,4,0,10/26/2011,"I've only been here once, but I sincerely enjoyed it. ˜I'm only about a block or two away and was looking for a restaurant to eat at with a friend after moving in. ˜We ended up choosing this over the pizza, sushi and Chinese places on the same street. ˜We sat outside, were served reasonably quickly (though we weren't in a rush, so it wasn't a problem), and had delicious food. ˜The cheesesteak was one of the best I've had (and as a Philly area-native, I'm picky), and ˜my friend had a burger and enjoyed it a lot. ˜The fries are awesome. ˜Can't speak to the alcohol as we didn't get any drinks. ˜I'm dying for another reason to go."
8701,16,4,0,7/25/2011,"Not a bad find in the middle of Spring Garden. You have to squeeze into the bathroom though! Decent crowd, decent prices. Will come back again."
8702,16,5,0,10/13/2014,"Great atmosphere, cheap drinks, a jukebox and a good staff. Bartender with hipster frames is great. Great place to get loaded and stumble home"
8703,16,5,0,7/5/2014,"Good beer selection, awesome staff, quick service and phenomenal cheesteaks make this my favorite Irish bar in the city. Definitely worth checking out!"
8704,16,5,0,12/28/2012,"The wings here are phenomenal, good beer selection, and great bartenders. ˜ I haven't had anything but a great time here whether alone or with friends."
8705,16,5,0,6/14/2010,"My home away from home. ˜Now that it's been re-did, you may feel better eating here, however, the food has always been great!"
8706,16,5,1,1/4/2015,"Very nice crowd here. First visit was tonight. Person running the bar was great, super easy to talk to and super fast about helping us. We got one special beer and two coke&Rums for me and they were both spectacular. Strong but still not that terrible aftertaste coughing or anything. Very smooth. Crowd was nice and seemed a little busy but friendly. Definitely coming here again. Hopefully tomorrow night."
8707,16,2,1,11/23/2014,While I love this place for the closeness to my house and the awesome wings the service SUCKS!! There aren't enough people working so while the bartender does try their best they just can't handle the amount of people. ˜ Neighborhood dive bar that needs more staff.
8708,16,4,1,10/19/2014,"Love this neighborhood bar. Cheap food, cheap drinks, jukebox. Everyone complaining about the space or especially the bathroom... IT'S A DIVE BAR. If you were expecting something fancy, put your money up. This is an old bar and you can tell. I love when cheap people expect the world. Keep dreaming"
8709,16,5,1,9/16/2014,I didn't come here expecting anything. A friend promised me wings and a beer on a Friday night. I walked away from Kellianns having eaten one of the best pork tenderloin sandwiches ever. I'm hooked!!
8710,16,3,1,8/5/2014,"I like their pierogies. The food is average but the menus changes with the season. The price of beer is pretty fair- don't order mixed drinks. It is nice to sit outside in the fall to watch people pass by at night. It can get loud and it can get a bit obnoxious outside, but it's not their fault. City View Pizza is right next door. ˜It's a good bar to go to when you don't feel like dealing with fancy menus and people. It's the grit bar. P.S. The old trough is under the bar, take a looksie at it because it is cool- but beware, the actual bathroom is tiny."
8711,16,4,1,7/31/2014,"Great neighborhood spot. Must try the burger! Tasty food, good service and moderately priced beer. Strong drinks and nice patrons.A little small, and a bit dive-like, but still very nice place during the week!"
8712,16,4,1,6/28/2014,"This bar and grill is located a block away from CCP main campus. Try the Salmon BLT. I learned it's only available seasonally. I come here relatively frequently for lunch. I love the bartender that usually there at this time. He automatically lets me know if the Salmon BLT if available that day, which I love. Lol. Service is good and pretty quick, esp since my lunch break is only for an hour. Haven't been here during happy hour or evening hours, so I can't give a rating for those hours and service."
8713,16,1,1,6/26/2014,"How does this place get more than a couple of stars for its average? It's overpriced and feels dirty. I went on a Saturday late night in the winter and it was nearly empty, yet my friend and I were ignored by the bartender for over 5 minutes before we finally got to order our $5 lagers. There food was not appealing. No ambience at all; it's not a dive, yet doesn't have any other personality either."
8714,16,4,1,6/9/2014,"I come here often before softball games. Dive bar-ish scene which is right up my alley, complete with photohunt and outdoor seating. It's a very relaxed atmosphere so sometimes it's hard to get the bartenders attention. My advice, stick to the beer and wine and stay away from mixed drinks. Numerous times they get the order wrong and the pours are just way off..most times leaving the drink way too strong to enjoy. For food, I've had the burger and wings. The burger was cooked correctly and the ciabatta bun was amazing. Sometimes the bun overpowered the burger but that's OK. And no complaints with the wings. You can't beat the prices here... $7 for a burger with fries. I mean come on. I loved it. I'll probably stick to just drinking here as it's dirty inside and sometimes not conducive to eating a full meal, for me at least. I'll keep coming back before games."
8715,16,2,1,4/6/2014,"I came in for dinner on a Friday night and got the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries. The meal was really good and I was all-around satisfied. Unfortunately, on Sunday night I ordered the exact same meal. The sandwich was significantly smaller, came on not-as-good bread, and they forgot the side of blue cheese (or ranch? I wasn't sure). As an extra little treat, I found a sharp piece of metal in my fries."
8716,16,4,1,3/27/2014,"With the bar being across the street from my apartment I find myself here pretty often. ˜The wings are great and the beer selection is solid. ˜It's what a corner bar should be. ˜There's typically only 1 bartender/server so when it get busy you'll have to wait a while for drinks. ˜It's definitely worth visiting, try the wings, you won't be disappointed."
8717,16,4,1,3/7/2014,"Kelliann's is a go-to buffalo wing spot for a lot of people, myself included. ˜They are not huge, but always good quality and the sauce is terrific. ˜They are in my top 3 wings in Philadelphia, definitely a contender for #1. Other menu items that friends have had here have been decent. ˜Never a complaint. I like the outside seating when it is nice out; it's a nice area of town. ˜The inside is pleasant as well. ˜Good place to watch sports. ˜Good draught beer list. ˜Legitimate Guiness pour. ˜Usually not packed, and as far as I can tell the clientele is friendly. ˜My servers have always been friendly."
8718,16,2,1,11/17/2013,"Went here, had a pint and some wings. The wings were average, not anything spectacular like the menu would have you believe. Small place, but nice to go watch the game at."
8719,16,3,1,11/7/2013,"The food was pretty good for bar food! However, I got the hard pear cider to drink and it was flat and not good. It is a good place to go and relax and have a drink"
8720,16,5,1,9/2/2013,If it is one place i miss it is def kelliann's bar. We used to live a few blocks from there and it was a great place to go have some drinks and take up the touch tunes. We used to shove $60 in it and play next haha. We will be sure to stop in and see all our fav bartenders soon. We will miss Pat and all the bartenders!
8721,16,4,1,8/24/2013,There is a reason this place got only 4 stars. The men's room is really small. ˜I have a 54 inch waist and I had a hard time turning around. Other than that I liked the place.
8722,16,3,1,8/18/2013,"This place is fine if you want beer, wine, or anything that doesn't require ""mixology"" (I almost threw up using that term). I used to stop by after stressful midterms at the school across the street and would always make the mistake of ordering either vodka martinis or vodka and soda. Though straightforward, they were always terrible. The redemptive quality? They are crazy strong drinks so if you're looking for a quick buzz, you know what to do. It's a super chill atmosphere, many of the bar seats occupied by obvious regulars. I liked watching games here during baseball season. Keep your order simple and you'll have a good time."
8723,16,3,1,6/11/2013,"Decent prices and good location for center city and Fairmount people, but awful cheese fries."
8724,16,5,1,6/10/2013,"This is an awesome little corner bar. Granted I live 30 seconds from it, but having it there is a gem. The food is awesome, the atmosphere is what it's supposed to be, a chill, laid back divey Irish bar. If you want upscale and martini's go to Rittenhouse, if you want good food, a solid beer selection, and great people from the neighborhood then you have found the place you want to be."
7919,16,2,1,5/17/2013,"Small place, pretty packed for lunch, one bartender/server was helping everyone in ˜the whole place. I thought he did an excellent job staying on top of everyone and we got our order taken and our food fairly quickly. Unfortunately the special burger (with blue cheese and bacon) was just okay. I ordered mine medium and it was well done, so it was a bit dry for my tastes. The bun was a little tough too. My friend ordered the same thing as I did but asked for no cheese, so instead of charging the same price as the special ($6.95 I think) he charged her for a hamburger with bacon on it ($10 for the hamburger and $2 for the bacon). Soooo, she got less stuff on it and paid almost twice as much? LAME. I'd give the server 4 stars for his quick service, but the food wasn't that great and the pricing policy sucks."
8725,16,5,1,4/6/2013,"Have worked in the area for 3 years and have passed over this place many times. Wow, was I WRONG. Great selection of beers on tap, simple and tasty (and reasonably priced) menu. I highly recommend the Blackened Chicken with Roasted Pepper and Provolone. It's one of the best I've ever had."
8726,16,4,1,3/12/2013,"I think that while Kelliann's looks like it would only be good for a few cheap bud lights and and standard bar fare, it deserves a lot more credit than that. ˜Considering everything in Fairmount is getting pricier by the second, Kelliann's has remained true to it's dive bar feel while consistently serving up some good, quality better-than-bar-food. ˜Their selection of sandwiches (um, chicken breast sandwich with asparagus... hello lovah) is great and they're all reasonably priced. ˜Their fries are always super crispy and thin, and their happy hour specials are great. ˜This is most definitely my favorite spot for a last minute meal."
8727,16,4,1,3/2/2013,Hard to park but go around back to do it. Quite little Irish pub. They also serve food. Have a Guinne and enjoy
8728,16,3,1,12/23/2012,"We just moved to the neighborhood and decided to catch a late dinner with drinks here a few nights ago. ˜Everything about this place is three-star worthy: They have a decent selection of beers on tap, but they're a little overpriced. ˜A pet peeve of mine is not having much of a description of the craft beers, and Kelliann's falls victim to this mistake. The food menu is nice for a late night bar meal. ˜Everything is grilled or fried, so don't expect anything too fancily prepared. ˜The star of the menu is the meatloaf. ˜It's delicious, grilled, and moist. ˜The spinach and fries are excellent as well, but it would be nice to see a mash or mac n' cheese as an option. ˜All the sandwiches are good, but not great, and the wings very good (a little hotter than you may expect). ˜ Nothing wrong with Kelliann's, but nothing extraordinary enough to make this my go-to bar. ˜The exploration will continue."
8729,16,4,1,8/24/2012,Nice dive with good cheap drinks. Good outside seating in the summer. I wouldnt recommend dinner here though
8730,16,4,1,7/15/2012,"Great corner bar, friendly bartenders, and relaxing atmosphere. This bar is the quintessential neighborhood corner bar. They serve my favorite irish whiskey, Clontarf, which very few Irish bars in Philly actually have. Haven't had anything but a great time here, can't wait to go again!"
8731,16,4,1,6/28/2012,"Kelliann's, a.k.a ""Smellyann's,"" is a great neighborhood bar: always reliable for Philly sports games, late-night eats, early-morning cocktails, or even drinks with your dog (they're pet friendly!). And to the reviewer who noted that they were not vegetarian-friendly: they now offer a delicious asparagus & mozzarella sandwich with pickled long-hot peppers. It's often on the specials menu, but even if you don't see it there, the chef will be glad to make it for you as long as they have fresh asparagus in-stock."
8732,16,4,1,6/27/2012,I work across the street and this is by far my favorite place - the spicy steak salad is to die for and I get every time...the music is always diverse and awesome and the service and atmosphere are friendly and relaxing. ˜We even bring our latops and sit at the bar to work on stuff.
8733,16,3,1,6/20/2012,"Once again, the champ has returned. In my hey day, I have received bean pies, e-winks and kisses, and in person airborne high fives for my highly erotic Philly reviews. Bros, stop it. I'm rockin Allen Edmonds. I cant be about my hangtime in some oxfords. Real talk though, REVIEWS. I miss that feeling. I miss that passion. That euphoria. The three corporate jobs that I have admittedly drained my energy, but im off that. ˜I've decided to step up my stamina for you, because I love you. Yall my homeskillets, and we're about to get it poppin and get it greasy and put on our game faces. KelliAnns. I like Kellianns. I used to live in Sierra Leone, lookin for diamonds for Kanye, but now I live next door to Kellianns. Life is a bitch. Beers next door to my residence? Automatic three stars. Whorehouse? Are the women clean? No. ˜Ugh.. But wait hold up.. do you sell beers? Yes! Automatic three stars. TL;DR : BEER = 3 STARS. On forward. The interior of kellianns is well designed. I love the way I look, no menswearhouse., yah mean. Im forever suited and booted, so the ability to look/wink/point and nod at myself in a large ass mirror with a hoegaarden is a plus. Forget the people here. Its all about you. It's so all about you. Like Batmans parents, this place is DEEAAADDD. FOREVER. I just got off work, and I walked into this place with my left hand wrapped around my chin all like ""God ˜DAYUM, how can I increase the traffic in this muhsucka."" I quickly disregarded those thoughts. I'm OFF WORK. I wanna just chilll... to the next episode. Im out here now, 6:37, ˜Wednesday June 20th, 2012, in a cheap ass chair outside that's bruising this very masculine and .... flat behind... Wait this girl just passed me with some dirty ass chucks.. [face_mischief] And im trying to grasp the appeal of this place. Def not a destination spot. Def not a spot where you can drink around interesting people. Def not a spot where you can bring friends. Well, unless you hate your friends. They'll be glancing at their wrists.. err excuse me.. it's 2012, looking at their cell phones for the time, like, "" Yo, bro, finish dat drink so we can roll."" And you're all like ""whoa whoa.. this place is kinda nic.."" And they'll all simultaneously shake their heads no. And you cant say anything. You just accept your loss, and just walk away. Just walk away."
8734,16,3,1,6/15/2012,"Have been back here twice for lunch... ordered the grilled chicken salad w/cranberries, goat cheese, and pecans on both occasions. So good and bonus points for being good for you. My coworkers have ordered various sandwiches which they really liked. A solid option for lunch."
8735,16,5,1,5/15/2012,"Sat at bar. ˜Ordered a burger off the specials menu that had long hots (the pepper) in it. ˜It was slammin. The fries were really thin/crispy/great as well. The beer was wet! ˜Outdoor seating looked cool! Yeah, eatin food!"
8736,16,3,1,5/4/2012,"Great for a few beers and some bar food. The jumbo lump crabcake is a bit of a misnomer, but what did I expect at an Irish pub?? The rest of the food was pretty decent. ˜The outdoor seating is a plus!"
8590,16,2,1,3/31/2012,"I've eaten here several times with coworkers. ˜When it comes to ordering, I can only choice between a salad or two. ˜The menu is not vegetarian friendly. ˜I make it a point to ask if there are any substitutions they can make. ˜My hope is that they just received some veggie burgers in the kitchen. ˜And that it's not been added to the menu yet. But everything time, I'm left with picking between two salads. With earth day a few weeks away, my hope is that they'll add some green meatless options to the menu. ˜And if they do, I'll happily try them and update this review."
8737,16,5,1,10/2/2011,"Oh Kelliann's...How I miss you. ˜I lived a block away for 2 years and it was my local bar. ˜It was so great to grab a quick beer after a stressful day, watch a Sunday football game there, and do weekly trivia. ˜My favorite tradition was that on every Friday night, we would pregame there, go to Center City, and then come back on our way home. ˜I miss how everyone there knew you and how the food was always quality and the people nice. ˜There were always some interesting characters there. ˜Make this your local bar! I also have the great memory of watching the Phillies win the World Series in this bar, which pushed it from a 4 star to a 5 star:)"
8738,16,4,1,6/4/2011,"Great neighborhood bar. Tap list is good--normal stuff plus some nice options like victory or yards. I have long been a fan of the wings here. They are just crispy enough and have a good sauce. I will say, however, the last batch I had could have been meatier. I also recently tried out their sandwhiches and other people at my group got salads. Great value for $7-8 per plate. Nothing gourmet, but better than the average neighborhood bar food. I would definitely come back here for a low key dinner. Plus, lots of outdoor seating."
6762,16,2,1,5/26/2011,Every morning I walk by Kellianns and noticed the delivery of bread. On a few occasion all of the bread was thrown across the floor. I don't step foot in the place anymore. ˜The bathrooms are nasty.
7632,16,4,1,4/23/2011,"This review is solely for the buffalo wings and I only took a star off because every time I go in this place, the smell of the bathroom hits me in the face. Having grown up in Scranton, I'm spoiled when it comes to wings. They should be meaty and succulent on the bone, have crispy skin, and a moderate slathering of buffalo sauce with an after kick of vinegar on the palate. Kelliann's achieves all of this. Served with delicious bleu cheese and a helping of celery, you can't go wrong. I've tried the wings from two others that claim to be the kings of Philly pub fare (McGillin's Ale House and Moriarty's Pub) and neither matched up. If you're looking for great buffalo wings, this is the place for sure."
8739,16,4,1,3/15/2011,"Thanks for being not busy during Erin Express. I didn't have to wait a single moment to use your restroom, it wasn't too busy, I didn't get drinks but I heard they were affordable, and your buffalo wings were to die for. Also, best blue cheese to come with buffalo wings I've ever had at a bar. Your fries were tiny and greasy and yet they had an allure to them. This was my favorite stop, my longest stop, and I hope to come back many times, regardless of your trek from my West Philadelphia apartment. Charming crowd, also."
8740,16,5,1,3/10/2011,"Oh Kelliann's- how I love thee. We used to come here all the time, back when the ceiling was disgusting, the bathrooms were deplorable, and the food was close to a miracle considering the size of the kitchen. Then there was a small fire, which might have been their saving grace, as they took that time they had to close to make some much-need repairs! They redid the ceilings, took the dark green shutters off of the windows (I see the light!), and spruced up the bathrooms (to include no longer being able to hear the opposite sex peeing...). The kitchen is still tiny and the food is still great. The beers are your standard selection with a few craft beers in the coolers. I'm partial to the chicken cheese steaks, the coconut shrimp salad special, and the meatloaf special. They have a rotating specials menu, the bartenders bust their butts to make sure you don't go thirsty, and the crowd is downright congenial, very much like Cheers and NORM! Special Note: There's outdoor seating! Also, they have a local artist's work on the walls and they are usually impressive. There's a long mirror behind the bar, so you can usually catch a glimpse of everything behind you no matter where you're sitting. Also, they have one of those new-fangled bar games thats hooked up to the digital jukebox :-) Perfect for when your significant other starts getting hammered and ignoring you..."
8741,16,3,1,2/2/2011,"I used to live a block from this place, they have really good burgers and fries, three huge tv's, and a neighborhood feel. ˜We used to pregame here because they put a decent amount of liquor in mixed drinks and they are super cheap."
8742,16,5,1,12/28/2010,"Kelliann's is a Philly legend, like me. Back in the day, there were operable drains on the floor at the bar for...that's right...urination whilst bellied up. Why get up to take a leak when you can just run yer willie out yer trousers to relieve the Irish bloat. The mad scientist, John O'Connor is the man behind the miracle. Such a bummer that he closed me favorite watering hole, Kelliann's on Spruce n 43rd in West Philly. So awesome was that place, KC even had drinks with the champ, Joe Frazier at the old haunt. So all we have left is the remaining Kelliann's which doesn't suck. Thanks for the many, many heavy pours of Powers Irish whiskey over the years, fellas. Godspeed."
8743,16,4,1,10/19/2010,"I was a pretty frequent guest at Kelliann's before I burned some bridges, and then well Kelliann's burned down...no connection... But this spot is pretty solid as long as the crowd isn't whack, that said on a good night you could pretty much dictate the vibe, which is always a good thing. ˜The owners a drunk too, so talk to him and he'll throw you a couple of drinks. Warning: watch out for egocentric bartenders."
7688,16,4,1,9/21/2010,"I've ridden my bike past Kelliann's at least a hundred times. ˜And while that's no exaggeration, I didn't know the name of this place until I visited last week. ˜If you're unclear of the spot I'm referring to, you may know it as I did: ""Crappy Irish place on the corner of 16th and Spring Garden."" ˜But my previous title and judgement were way off the mark. This place is pretty small; a long bar greats you at the door and runs almost the entire length of the skinny space. Some outdoor seating surely helps this place from seeming too crowded. ˜Upon entering, I looked towards the taps to judge the place. ˜Some regular locals, plus Sam Adams, a few Irish brews, and the real star of the day, Spaten Octoberfest. ˜This is a tasty beer, and at $5 for a 20 oz mug (in proper glassware, if that's your thing) it was a great deal. ˜Overall, the beer list is nothing special, but you should be able to find something that will pacify if not satisfy. The place doesn't have much atmosphere for itself, but it surely has an interesting collection of patrons. Off duty nurses, construction workers, staff and students from nearby CCP, and folks like myself are elbow to elbow at the bar. ˜To help me feel more at home, our bartender was friendly welcoming, and attentive. Looking at the menu, I received the biggest shock. ˜Almost everything on the menu was between 5 and 7 dollars, and included items such as a cheeseburger, turkey club, 10 piece chicken wings, steak sandwich, and the likes. ˜Not incredible food, but decent food at a good price. ˜I had a few wings, which were solidly average, but enjoyable. ˜The turkey club was also good, and included a ridiculous amount of sliced turkey, and was topped with cheese. ˜I'd eat here again. ˜ Bottom Line: ˜Kelliann's isn't amazing. But the good deals on food and beer, coupled with good service and real people make this an enjoyable joint. ˜Everyone should at least give it a chance."
8744,16,2,1,9/17/2010,"Came in tonight to grab a late night beer. It was stone dead, maybe 10 people in there yet the bartender took a strong 5-7 minutes to even acknowledge my existence. He finally strolled over to ask me what I wanted. It was close to last call and I had finished my first Hoegarrden fairly quickly. I expected him to be a little more attentive considering there were only 5-7 people actually seated at the bar. Anyway, I had 2 Hoegarrdens and left. I guess an alright place to grab a beer if you live close but definitely not a destination place you make plans to go to. Overall a disappointment each of the 3 times I've come here post-fire and partial renovation."
8745,16,3,1,8/9/2010,"I have mixed feelings about this bar. The food is always great, and honestly if I'm going out with the intent to eat (as opposed to environment/drink specials) then I tend to choose this spot. The drinks are average priced, and the bartenders are either great or not so much. The place has a pretty nice feel to it, and plenty of outside seating. I don't think I've ever seen this place packed which to me is nice. ˜But what gets me is the music. I've considered leaving earlier than I wanted to a number of times because I just couldn't stand the music. So every time I've been there I've popped in for a quick bite and a couple beers, and split."
8746,16,4,1,7/6/2010,"The Ultimate Irish Corner Bar. ˜Maybe the McSorley's of Philadelphia? Went there for the first time today and was very impressed. ˜Kelliann's attracts a diverse crowd that included business people, carpenters, college students and everything inbetween. ˜The bar looks inviting the the subway tile floors remind me of New York City. Since this was only lunch, my table had only food. ˜I opted for the barbecue cheddar chicken sandwich and fries. ˜My chicken was a nice portion of white breast of chicken and was actually grilled and not just put on a stove top. ˜The barbecue sause was a little lacking, but the chicken had great flavoring from the grill. ˜The fries were also amazing as they had a flavor tinge of McDonald's fries (and yes that is a good thing). ˜The fries were thin and crispy and seemed to be homemade (can anyone verify this?). ˜Service was adequate and most tables were occupied. ˜Definitely a great place for lunch or possibly happy hour in that neighborhood."
8747,16,5,1,5/30/2010,"Good food, strong drink for cheap, and darts. Leave pretension at the door please. Yes, the fire of 2010 definitely was a good excuse to spruce up the bathroom and clear out the clutter. The strong points are still there. They've even capitalized on the event by making ""We're on fire"" t-shirts. I get the cranberry and goat cheese salad every time and it has yet to disappoint."
8748,16,3,1,3/21/2010,"After our Philly sports club football game on Saturday, we were in the mood for some day drinking, preferably outside. ˜So we came to Kelliann's. 1. Outdoor seating (and lots of it) 2. Simple, to the point menu with all the basics 3. Food is good..their mozzarella sticks are some of my favorites in Philly 4. After reopening post-fire, the inside is very similar to pre-fire, only shiny and new."
8749,16,5,1,3/16/2010,"I'm here right now and the music is great, the food is great. And I'm loving the blackened shrimp Caesar salad. My hubby absolutely loves the wings and the bartender/ waitress is so nice. I will definitely come back if I am in the area."
8750,16,4,1,3/13/2010,My local watering hole in the closest proximity to my house- I had spent a great deal of time at KA's upon returning from Germany. An argument could be made on whether or not KA's is qualified as a 'dive bar' (not said negatively) or 'Irish pub' or even just a 'corner bar' it's all of these and none ˜of them. I'm reviewing this after they have done some remodeling from a fire that happened a few weeks prior and let me tell you that any of the information below about the place being too dark has been fixed. Now that the bars are off the windows and the shudders replaced the atmosphere is bright and airy. Standard prices apply- and pretty good wings every time I stop in. Not the best but defiantly above par. If it's your first time at KA's you will get the impression that everyone knows each other- which they do... but they are open to new blood so don't be surprised if you are some interesting conversations by nights end. Defiantly a worthwhile stop for pre-gaming or an early meet up with friends.
8751,16,5,1,3/7/2010,"It's back open again! Dig! So if I were to write a review about it, let me share this: cleanliness is godliness. In this area, Kelliann's has improved considerably. The bathroom is still small, but feels much cleaner, and isn't that what you really want from a bathroom? And though the bar has just been varnished, and that might explain it, it doesn't smell like rancid beer. I mean, I never noticed it... I may have been too close. Frankly, I never cared. It's about booze. Otherwise same bar, same crowd, same things I've missed for over a month. Good to be back, hope to see you here!"
8752,16,4,1,8/29/2009,"I'm finally getting around to reviewing this place. I'm lazy. It is what it is: A true neighborhood bar. The best part of Kelliann's is that it doesn't try to be something it's not -- and I like that. I've been going here since the mid 90's. In the past few years, though, it's really come into it's own. I know 90% of the people that frequent this place. I can go on any night, by myself, and know I will run into friends and neighbors... and we'll hang out, chew the fat and get sauced. I don't get that community feeling from any other bar in our neighborhood. The prices are really reasonable and the food is good, cheap bar fare with large portions. I recommend the Ahi Tuna Burger with spicy mayo, the Cranberry Salad w/ chicken and goat cheese, and the Sliders. All the bartenders know how to make a really good cocktail."
8753,16,4,1,7/17/2009,"There is a lot to like about Kelliann's. The food is good and cheap and served late in large portions. It has a nice neighborhood bar feel. I'd describe it as a nicer dive bar, but with good food. Almost every time I go there I get good service. The beer selection is good (but not great) and they are not stingy with their liquor either. ˜ There is a sizable outside section which is handy considering the bar is rather small. My only complaints is their habit of playing commercial radio when no one is pumping money into the jukebox. I'm not picky about what music is playing in a bar, but I just don't like to listen to obnoxious commercials while i'm drinking. If you live in the neighborhood you should definitely check this place out!"
8754,16,3,1,6/27/2009,"Had a beer with a couple of friends the other day here. ˜It's a cozy, small place with a couple of outdoor tables. ˜The bartender was friendly too. ˜I should come back for this Quizzo that Meg and Meredith are talking about."
8755,16,4,1,5/8/2009,"It is about time I laid down a serious review for Kelliann's. I have lost enough rounds of Quizzo here to be able to assess the situation. First off, the space is small and the tables tend to be close together. During busy nights, it can get a bit cramped. However, the friendly patrons make the tight squeeze feel less awkward. Like Meredith said, this is a neighborly bar whose customers are almost always from our hood. That said, Kelliann's is not at all pretentious or trying to be a gastropub (thank god). The food tends to be good and cheap. The sliders are great, they come with fresh-cut fries and they're only $6. I also had a grilled tuna burger here that was wonderful with the spicy sauce with which it was served. Salads are surprisingly fresh and the portions are generous. The beer menu is the usual suspects- Yards, Guinness, Yuengling, Sam Adams, ect. However, Deb is a great bartender. She mixes strong drinks with precision and speed."
8756,16,4,1,5/3/2009,"Since Kelliann's is in close proximity to my apartment, I find myself in here pretty often for late-night drinks on weekends. However, it wasn't until this past Wednesday that I realized I should have been coming here every week. One word: Quizzo! Had the lovely Meg C. never informed me of this phenomenon, it probably would have taken much longer to pop my Quizzo cherry. Let me just tell you, it was everything I had always dreamed it would be (without the pain, bleeding, or premature ejaculation!). The crowd at Kelliann's is very neighborly. In fact, I walked in on Wednesday night and was greeted by my across-the-street neighbor, which was a nice and unexpected surprise (and we just so happened to need two more people for our Quizzo team!). You won't meet a nicer bunch of locals than at this bar. I remember back to the first time I ever came here, and almost immediately upon entering I was asked by a drunken local woman for a hug. You don't experience that often in Philly. I have yet to try the food here, but if it's as good as I hear it is, I won't be too stingy in awarding it its fifth star. With friendly and attentive bar staff, reasonable drink prices, a fun-loving crowd, and a prime location, Kelliann's leaves little to be desired. As far as dive bars go, this place gets two thumbs up in my book."
8149,16,4,1,4/1/2009,"Surprisingly good food here. ˜Especially for a local bar. We had salads with grilled chicken, pecans, dried cranberries and goat cheese crumbles. ˜All for $6.95. It does reek of beer though. And the service was excellent. ˜A cool lady bartender with ""Trust Me"" and 2 crossed handguns tattooed across her chest. ˜She was cool! Considering that I now work right across the street, I will likely be a lunch time regular."
8757,16,4,1,11/30/2008,"Things you need to know: At 9:00pm the wings are only 25 cents a piece. Grab a plate--they're tasty, and the celery is fresh. The chowder is not amazing, but it is good. Lager here is $3.50 a glass, and most other taps are $5.00. Pretty average pricing if you ask me. The place was packed last Tuesday when I went for the first time. There is a lot of bar space, though, and a bunch of tables. Be prepared to stand, like most of the patrons. The jukebox is one of those modern Internet variations. Get ready for a wide variety of tunes. The bathrooms are small, and pretty nasty, but the graffiti more than makes up for it. Great clientele, too. Definitely not the hippest place, though it's no drag either. Twenty-somethings and older made up the crowd, making for a rather mature, up-beat atmosphere."
8225,16,4,1,7/28/2008,"At 75% Irish I usually find myself having a profound and utter distaste for off Irish pub's. But I found this Kelliann's ˜(I feel like the West Philly one could be another story) to be a chill little pub. It might have been the random and fun crew that I was with, the Bacardi mask that made the rounds, The round of Irish Car Bombs, or the Madonnathon on the jukebox courtesy of Big Drew doing the the talking. But I'd even say it's perfect for a good weekend gathering. The bartenders definitely hooked up some spot on service. The beer varieties were good and plentiful. And even though I don't really get the fuss behind sliders (they look like White Castle) the food did look mighty tasty. The bar has a colorful group of regulars that like to dance to random songs too. I think I'll be back."
8246,16,4,1,7/25/2008,"I had a load of fun here. ˜ There was just a ""normal"" crowd. ˜I asked the bartender if it was normally not so busy on Fridays and he said it was the summer crowd. ˜Still I like me a dead bar in the summer. ˜Keeps the jerks at bay. They have a satellite jukebox which means that Big Drew can scare the squares with a Madonnathon and other not super straight music. ˜It was fun. I bought 6 sliders instead of 3 because i felt HUNGRY. ˜3 hit the spot just fine though and other people finished the rest. ˜ ˜They were really good sliders though. ˜They were all cooked medium rare.. not over broiled like most places. Overall...would go back again and again."
8758,16,4,1,3/30/2008,"This is one of the first places I went to after I moved to the city. ˜I've had several items from the menu and liked everything but the crab soup. My favorite is probably the blackened burger with hand cut french fries. ˜They have several beers on tap, including two of my favorites, Guinness and Blue Moon. As far as liquor selection they seem to have just about anything you could possibly drink. What's really cool about this place is that it doesn't matter where you are from. If you hang out here and talk to people, they will talk back to you. You won't be ignored or made to feel uncomfortable. Its a real nice atmosphere. There are a couple of regulars in just about every day if not every day on the weekend so you always end up knowing someone there. ˜And if you are really lucky you'll get to see the crazy Trinidadian do his dance(he's really good)."
8759,16,4,1,3/27/2008,"I love Kelliann's. It's been my regular hangout since I moved here almost 5 years ago. We've lived in the Spring Garden District for the majority of our time here, so my boyfriend and I just like to walk over to Kelliann's for a hangout. Personally, I do NOT like college crowds. I prefer to go places where I can feel relaxed and hangout without having to shout to be heard. Kelliann's can *usually* provide that, with the occasional mess of people. I'm not really sure what brings them -- it feels really random to me. But I guess that's a good, because it shows that the bar attracts a really diverse crowd. I've been there when it was just a few guys sitting around after work watching a hockey game; when it was filled with Eagles fans shouting drunkenly at the flat screens; when it was filled with people from the CW Building across the street, having wine after work; and when it's been filled with what seems like an overflow from the Old City crowd. Kelliann's always has really friendly, personable bartenders though, including the owner of the place who will occasionally buy a round on the house when it's a room full of regulars. The food selection is pretty good [their chicken Caesar salad is the best thing I've ever eaten], though they close the kitchen pretty early [around 10 or so, I think]. As far as entertainment, they have a live band there every Sunday night, and the rest of the time it's between the radio, jukebox [if the patrons are feeding it], or whatever sporting event is on the flat screens. My only problem with the place is the size -- it's a teeny little Celtic bar and the very definition of a hole int he wall. But it's definitely always clean and crisp."
8760,17,4,0,7/25/2014,"Yummy! Front counter girl was so nice. Fun, local soda"
8761,17,5,0,2/26/2014,"Delicious! we were at Ikea that day, and my girlfriend was craving a delicious hot dog, and she looked up hot dogs, and this place came up, we drove right to it! & the owners SUPER NICE, i love that is family owned,and SO SO SO DELICIOUS :) go here for hot dogs!!! i had the Mac DOg, and she had the BBQ dog :)"
8762,17,5,0,6/13/2013,"This is one of those tiny little places that unless you knew it was there you'd miss it. You have to check it out. The hotdogs are delicious and they come in some interesting combinations. The owner is friendly and the food is good. I will definitely eat there again, and again."
8763,17,5,0,2/15/2013,"I had recently heard about this gem. I was hungry for lunch while at work and decided to order. There is a great menu with many choices. The atmosphere is very friendly. And the fantastic smells greet you at the door. I chose the California and the BBQ. Both excellent choices. I fancy myself as a hot dog snob, and these definetly lived up to my highest expectations. Delicious and cooked perfectly. I am so glad there is something like this in the area of Yale University and Yale Hospital. I inquired about the ingredients. Hummels, and all top notch toppings and choices!!! You can't go wrong here. Good luck Cory, you've hit a home run."
8764,17,5,0,1/23/2013,"I'm from the Midwest, and these are the best chilli dogs i've ever had. Nice to see a small, family owned and run business making good food at a decent price. Welllllllllll worth the trek up from Yale's campus if you like hot dogs or mac and cheese--you just can't really get this kind of food down there."
8765,17,5,0,12/2/2012,"At 957 State St, Jordan's Hot Dogs and Mac is a good 20-30 minute walk away from the Yale campus. And for students hungry for a good meal, it's the perfect amount of time needed to build up an appetite. Upon entering, we encountered a fragrance of grilling hot dogs and fresh condiments, as well as a relatively simple cooking station, set up to manufacture exactly what the restaurant promised. We fumbled around for a few minutes: Djenab wasn't the biggest hot dog eater, Eric had recently lunched, and I had picked up a bug and wasn't about to eat any time soon. But the options were vast, ranging from the Bacon and BBQ Dog to the Georgia Red Hot, as were the possible toppings. Ultimately, Djenab chose the BLT dog (topped with bacon, lettuce and tomato), and Eric decided on the famous Mac Dog (with mac and cheese). The chef got diligently to work, wearing a smile the entire way. Once our food was delivered, we sat outside to eat, huddling together for warmth from the brisk winds. The BLT Dog was fresh, as the lightly buttered bread added a nice crunch, and the freshness of the veggies lightened the meat, which was not too greasy. Moreover, the Mac Dog was cooked to perfection and the mac and cheese was spiced just right; together they created a wonderful taste."
8766,17,5,1,12/20/2014,"Jordan's Hot Dog and Mac is the place to be! A wide variety of hot dog choices, sides, and even burgers for those of you who don't do dogs. I had the Mac Dog...initially thought it would be weird, but on the first bite, was reminded how much I liked hot dogs in my childhood Mac n' Cheese. Also had Foxon Park soda selection that we love! Our second visit, and still very pleased. A family run business. We were happy to be kindly greeted and remembered by the owners!"
8767,17,3,1,11/19/2014,Decent hotdogs but ran out of chips and pickles and was not offered anything else. Also hot dog was smaller than I thought. Check in to get a deal!
8768,17,5,1,8/29/2014,"Clean atmosphere, friendly staff, good location and great dogs. Too many options beg for many visits. Online ordering helps for take out."
8769,17,5,1,8/25/2014,Mac & cheese on a hot dog?? GENIUS! And delicious. The bbq bacon dog is awesome too. Highly recommend this place. Good food at school price. I've only been able to make it down there once so far but i can't wait to go back.
8770,17,4,1,8/5/2014,"Really good dogs! Having just visited this weekend (and using the free bacon BBQ coupon from Yelp!) I was pretty satisfied with Jordan's. It was a nice first experience and though it wasn't the most filling meal for the price paid, it was the best hot dog I've ever had. With the coupon, we were able to get two hot dogs and a small side of fries for $12. Not the cheapest meal when you consider the actual amount of food you're served but the hot dogs are sizable and smothered in delicious toppings. The shop itself is cute, quaint, and on a decorated street in downtown New Haven. The staff is friendly and there appears to be a large helping of regular customers who come in and out with their orders already known. It's a great little place to stop in for a hot dog but if you're looking for a more satisfying and filling meal, I'd save Jordan's for a Sunday afternoon or a sudden craving snack. Otherwise, it was an amazing hot dog with a lot of delicious flavors."
8771,17,5,1,7/26/2014,"OMG! ˜Hubby and I were looking for a quick lunch on the way to Ikea and found this via Yelp. My only regret is that we don't live closer but from now on all of our trips to New Haven will include a stop to Jordan's to see Cory and Tiffany. ˜The chili mac dog supreme was excellent and the Jordan burger, with the surprise of a sweet glaze was also a winner. LOVED the toasty, buttery bun on both the dog and the burger...a wonderful thouch. The showstopper of our visit however, was the beans....and I don't even like beans! ˜Will be dreaming of beans tonight..."
8772,17,3,1,7/9/2014,"So a couple disclaimers. The first is that my experience was via delivery. The delivery option was great and worked out well so no complaints there BUT I feel that with all delivery, regardless of place, the food quality does suffer. Second, I didn't get a hot dog- ok shame on me. I did get one of the burgers and honestly, the burger itself was extremely tasty. ˜As far as delivery burger quality- very good. It was served on a very good hot dog bun but the burger/sandwich itself was very small. A normal sized person could easily eat two of them. The crinkle cut fries weren't worth eating- nothing special and even less special semi-soggy after delivery. The chili Mac was decent. The chili and jalape?o's had good flavor but I must say that the Mac itself was short on flavor. I may be spoiled by all of the great Mac and Cheese options out there but I can't ignore that. I could have used more chili and jalape?o to flavor the Mac. So, overall a decent delivery option but certainly not a place that I would rave to all of my friends about. If I'm in the area, I'd certainly be tempted to swing by and try a hot dog and the prices are definitely reasonable. Everyone says the people and service is great and I'm always happy to support a local business. Again I'm wishing 3.5 stars was an option."
8773,17,5,1,6/23/2014,"Finally a hot dog made to perfection.Very friendly staff, easy to locate and the hotdogs are amazing all the time. Made your way and topped to your liking. This place is the best"
8774,17,4,1,6/19/2014,"I got the chili mac dog. ˜It was well worth the 7.30$ it costs. ˜The mac and cheese was nice and creamy, and, as others have mentioned, the chili had a sweetness to it, maybe even cinnamon. ˜Normally, I'm not a big fan of sweet chili, but I thought the flavor was subtle enough and it meshed very well with the rest of the dog. ˜The bun also comes toasted and buttery, and was very good. ˜I also found the staff quite friendly. ˜I would definitely recommend Jordan's based on the chili mac dog alone."
8775,17,4,1,6/5/2014,"I am always in search of a good Hot Dog stand so in entering Jordans new location on State St. it's an ideal hot dog joint { I say that with respect } good size tables if you wish to eat there the menu is extensive Dogs,Burgers,Mac, turkey burgers and turkey dogs something for everyone I had to try their Chili Dog with fries perfectly cook my wife had to try the Mac and Cheese drinks both of us had a old favorite Foxons cream soda Wow great lunch, by all means it is a very good choice."
8776,17,5,1,3/8/2014,They have THE BEST mac and cheese... Their hot dogs are amazing. My personal favorite is the kielbasa. Try Jordans you will not be disappointed!
8777,17,5,1,2/28/2014,"I Love Hot dogs, so falling in love with this place wasn't a Big surprise! They took toppings I would've never thought to put on a hot dog & made it great. I come here every Friday after getting my hair done! Never a let down, great place, great food, great Customer Service!!!"
8778,17,3,1,2/8/2014,"I just recently heard about Jordan's and have heard great things - I LOVE hot dogs so I was really looking forward to trying one. I am a plain-Jane when it comes to my hot dogs. I don't want all the stuff on the top, give me mustard. Period. However, I decided to expand my tastes and try something different. My coworker and I decided to order online (we both had credit card and it made placing and order and using two cards SO convenient - they deserve 5 stars for that advantage). I ordered the New Yorker as well as a Plain Dog with just mustard. Our order arrived within the 45min-1hr time frame which was perfect. I was not ""wow'd"" by the hot dogs which was really depressing. The reviews here made me super excited and I really feel let down. They were ok. The New Yorker was topped with mustard, sweet relish and onion sauce. The sweet relish was too sweet, I think regular or hot would be better. The hot dog was a little flavorless and I was not into the toasted bun. The plain hot dog was not great either as it had no flavor! I got mustard - the only option is yellow which I do not like on my hot dog. The pickles just tasted like cucumbers, they were not 'pickled'. I also ordered a side of cole slaw - still was not impressed. it ended up in the trash. It was pretty bland and very ""white""...maybe too much mayo? Seriously my two favorite foods, hot dogs and cole slaw and I was pretty let down. I really wanted to love this place since it is so close to where I work, but sadly I probably will not go back for another. Kudos for the delivery, quick, easy and the guy who brought them was very nice. If it wasn't for this aspect, probably would have been 2-star."
8779,17,5,1,2/3/2014,"Stumbled on this place accidentally while ducking into the bakery next door and....dude! It's great! The service is friendly and efficient, the hot dogs are top notch and the menu is compact but creative. Come here. (Also, I noticed that they deliver for those in town!)"
8780,17,5,1,2/1/2014,"After hearing great things from friends, I just got my first delivery from Jordan's and it was all I dreamed it could be!! ˜I ordered the Bacon BBQ dog, the Californian dog and the mac and cheese. ˜I heard that they are cash only, but I was able to pay with a card on Grub Hub, so that took care of that. ˜The delivery came in about 15-20 minutes. ˜The Bacon BBQ dog was AMAZING!! ˜I could eat 10 of them! ˜The Californian (basically a chili dog) was also very good. ˜These are foot-long, grilled dogs on nice buttery buns. The mac and cheese was yummy. ˜I felt that the prices were pretty reasonable considering all the toppings and the size, oh and the fact that they got delivered to my door. ˜Definitely check these guys out!"
8781,17,5,1,1/9/2014,"Review in a few words: Delicious hot dogs to go. ˜Speedy/friendly service. Review in full: ˜Stop what you're doing right now. ˜Go to Jordan's and get yourself a hot dog. ˜It doesn't matter which - they're all delicious. ˜Oh you were already eating something? ˜Throw it out and get down to State Street already! ˜You can thank me later. Jordan's is a small shop that features a variety of footlong hot dogs. They have most of the familiar standards (New Yorker/New Englander/Dixie - missing a Chicago dog!), a few new ones on me (Steakhouse dog), and, their real star, the chili mac supreme. ˜It has been said in other reviews but the chili here really is something that must be tried. ˜It doesn't pack much heat but it is sweet and honestly just plain delicious. ˜It combines well with the hot dog and mac and cheese and there also are a number of sides you can throw on at no additional charge (I added tomato and pickle because I was missing my Chicago). ˜Jordan's just hits it out of the park in terms of flavor. Jordan's is cash only and more-or-less a take out only business. ˜They have one small table and two chairs so it is difficult (but not impossible) to eat in. ˜Another thing that must be mentioned is the owner. ˜Jordan is friendly and most importantly proud of his work. ˜This doesn't seem like much at first but it definitely translates into the cooking. Lastly, Jordan's delivers! ˜My first experience with Jordan's was via delivery and it is a nice touch for those lazy days. On the whole Jordan's is a welcome addition to New Haven. ˜I grew up in Fairfield near Super Duper Weenie and this now saves me a drive down 95 whenever I get that nostalgic feeling. ˜Certainly a worthy challenger."
8782,17,5,1,11/23/2013,Coming here was the best thing I've done in a while. A dog that would be delicious just plain on the grilled bun. Topped with a chili (is that cinnamon?) and mac and cheese that both tasted like home. All together... heaven. Pickle was the type you want to eat by the plateful.
8783,17,5,1,9/22/2013,"They stayed open for us after hours, and the hot dogs were awesome."
8784,17,5,1,9/14/2013,"Amazing! I've ordered from Jordan's twice and each time was great. Food is delivered fast, hot and with a smile. The Georgia Hot is classic and yummy. The Mac Supreme is indulgent, spicy and filling. I also love the deli pickles."
8785,17,5,1,7/30/2013,"I was never a man of the hot dog, but now I am. I'm now a hot dog man because of Jordan's. I just mosey'd in from the street looking for something quick to eat. Got ""The Californian"" and it basically made me into who I am today. Premiumly high quality hot dog, toppings and bun. I have yet to try the mac and cheese so I'll be going again tomorrow or in an hour."
8786,17,5,1,7/20/2013,"I ordered delivery from Jordan's tonight, and it was delicious! I ordered a Georgia Red Hot with a side of mac. The hot dog tasted like it just came off the bbq, and the bun was nice and toasted. The condiments were fantastic, and very high quality. The mac was great too, hot deli style. The woman who delivered it was very friendly. I will certainly order from Jordan's again!"
8425,17,4,1,2/21/2013,"I stopped in a few weeks ago. ˜I got the dog with the Mac & cheese and jalape?os. ˜It was really good. ˜I'd love another one but I'm recently watching carbs & calories.. But whenever I get to treat myself Jordan's will be on my radar! Then again I could always have sauerkraut and a Georgia hot?! Hmm.. There is one table, and street parking. ˜Try it!"
8787,17,5,1,1/5/2013,"If you don't like this place, you are a bad person."
8788,17,4,1,12/7/2012,"Great little hot dog joint. Family owned and run, nice people, support small businesses."
8789,17,4,1,10/8/2012,"As I believe I've mentioned before, being a lover of encased processed meat byproducts means that I can spot a hot dog sign from quite a distance. Which is why, while the BF & I were wandering down State Street waiting for our pizza from Modern, I spied the ""Hot Dog"" sign across the street (from about a block away). We went in and chatted up the lovely couple working there. They're a husband & wife team and very personable. I learned that they serve both Hummel Bros brand and Georgia Red Hots. Since I was technically on a pizza taste test tour, I had to limit myself. Having never had a Georgia Red Hot, I figured I'd try that. They had run out of mac & cheese so that wasn't an option. The red hot was good, pretty large and quite spicy. Prices range from $3.50 for a basic all beef to $7.80 for a mac dog supreme (mac & cheese, bacon, jalapenos on a potato bread bun). They serve Foxon Park beverages which seems common in that area. I can't wait to go back and try a Hummel Bros.!"
8790,18,1,0,12/17/2012,"I had heard about Adela's for many years and on this site. ˜So, last year, since I was graduating law school, my family and I decided to order our food from here. ˜That was mistake #1. ˜The second mistake we made was in actually paying for the food that was mediocre and with an incredibly rude staff. ˜Nevertheless, we decided to give it another try and returned today (12/17/12). ˜Guess what...nothing has changed. ˜The food was tasteless and they are still just as rude. ˜BTW, we are Puerto Rican's so we thought perhaps the food might be as good as abuela's. ˜We were wrong. ˜We thought if we spoke Spanish, they might be nicer. ˜We were wrong. ˜Adela -- I don't go for 3 strikes but I'm sure you don't care."
8791,18,2,0,8/11/2009,"Some have raved over the food, others have commented on the ""laid back family atmosphere"". ˜Typically both are great. However, it seems that each time I venture down to Casa Adela without my spanish-speaking roommate, I step through some vortex into a parallel universe. ˜Instead of smiles, I am met with glares. ˜I am treated like an asshole. ˜No matter how nice, quiet and patient I am with the service, I am treated like a nuisance. ˜It makes me wonder if they haven't mistaken me for someone who took their lunch money when they were younger. Really, I would rate this place a 4, except that when I go by my non-spanish speaking self, this place deserves 0 stars. ˜So if you are fluent in Dominican or Puerto Rican spanish or can at least fake it, go for it. ˜Or, if you don't mind being huffed and puffed at or outright ignored, go for it."
8792,18,3,0,1/30/2011,"This place is totally awesome. The place is pretty small and feels like someone's kitchen. There's always random people sitting around, hanging out, watching tv and sipping cafe con leche. Sometimes they have their shoes off. Sometimes their grandkids are doing homework next to them."
8793,18,4,0,8/17/2014,"If you want some real Puerto Rican home cooking then this is the place to come to. Prices are very reasonable- you'd be hard pressed to prepare a meal for the same price at home. The food is tasty and fresh. The cooks and wait staff are very friendly and seem to be family, uncles, aunt etc. Try the rotisserie chicken and roast pork. Pop out the back through the kitchen and you can see it all cooking. If I lived in the neighbourhood I'd be a regular, as it is I live in New Zealand"
8794,18,4,0,12/14/2012,total favorite for puerto rican food - love going here for breakfast too. the staff is great - sometimes the food can be just a little bland though.
8795,18,4,0,11/18/2011,"very good whole roasted chicken, good spanish food!"
8796,18,4,0,5/22/2010,"Casa Adela, this small family-style eatery behind Tompkins, has it right. It's got a casual atmosphere, a mix of Puerto Rican regulars and hipsters, and tip-top home-style cooking. Try the Chicken Stew, finish with a hand-made espresso, and you can't go wrong. Also BYOB, but don't tell."
8797,18,4,0,1/13/2010,"A half rotisserie chicken, a cup of black beans, large plate of rice and a plate of sweet OR crispy plantains ALL for only $8. Mama Adela cooks your feast herself while her grown son sits with some other locals in the 6 table restaurant and yells, ""mama"" in his Spanish accent to her every few minutes for whatever reason. There is a small TV tucked in the upper back corner of the restaurant with foreign soaps on all day. The wait staff is delightful and the atmosphere is funky, friendly and homey. My god, it is brilliant."
8798,18,5,0,8/24/2014,Most amazing food left in nyc
8799,18,5,0,12/5/2013,"Some of the best seasoned rotisserie chicken you can find in the area! It has the feeling of being back in Coamo, PR. Love it."
8800,18,5,0,6/12/2013,"Auth! Great food! My partner and I skipped only a day out of her 4-day NY visit... She even bought some for her fam before leaving NY :) when she got inside Casa Adela, she said it smells just like her grandma's kitchen...very authentic PR resto... You made her extra happy :) thanks! u gave us such happy tummies! keep it up! Friendly people and great food...."
8801,18,5,0,4/9/2013,"I love this place. I am so glad that my family and I went there this weekend. The food taste like my mother-in-laws on the island. It was a little hard to find, and the parking was okay very New York city if you know what I mean. However, the food will make you forget all of that. The pork chops are so good and cooked to perfection, man I wish I had one now. Go there don't waist your time looking for any-other place ˜good there you will enjoy it. Did I mension the arroz con habicuelas okay just go"
8802,18,5,0,4/3/2013,"If you are looking for an inexpensive hole in the wall to eat some real deal Puertorican style cooking, you have to go to Casa Adela. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and this is where I go when I miss my moms cooking. Get anything you want! Just go for it cause when you get the bill you will be even happier. Rotisserie chicken all day, rice, beans, fried plantain, mofongo, alcapurrias (fritters), etc, DO IT!"
8803,18,5,0,8/10/2012,i have been going for years - another amazing restaurant that people should know about. ˜roast chick is THE dish and it took me a while to branch out but now chicarrones and pernil and chuletas all amazing. and BYOB!
8804,18,5,0,4/29/2012,"Damn, this place is very good and very cheap classic puerto rican food. Wish they had a puerto rican place this good in California .. Small family owned business but the people are great and the food is better."
8805,18,1,1,1/1/2015,"These small Spanish restaurants really need to educate themselves in business before opening a restaurant. I went to casa Adela Tuesday night to get an order to go. So I'm standing at the counter and there's four people behind the counter none of who seem to be aware or care that there's a customer waiting to order. Now I'm the only customer there except for a couple sitting at a table. Finally after about 5 to 6 (I should have left at this time) minutes a worker says did you order? I'm like is she serious. I finally order, it took forever to get, I thought it was a nightmare. Then the woman worker can't figure out what to charge me and comes up with a random number. I tell that can't be right and then she says oh sorry that's someone else's bill. Casa Adela shame you. Your business sense and etiquette are really poor. Consider getting some business sense it might help you stay in business longer. Ty"
8806,18,1,1,12/28/2014,"Adela's is authentic Puerto Rican food--nothing spectular, but home made. Upon the advice of a friend, I went to the restaurant and ordered three dozen pasteles for Thanksgiving (two dozen regular and one dozen yucca). The pasteles were already made and the guy just had to go upstairs and retrieve them. He seemed confused with the order and it had to be repeated to him at least three times. When I finally got my order, I went home and placed them in the freezer without giving it a second thought. Long story short, ˜it turns out Casa Adela did not give me any yucca pasteles at all. None! ˜Not only that, the one dozen they had wrapped separately for me marking them as yucca, were not yucca at all and were filled with chicken! ˜I had never eaten chicken pasteles and the idea of chicken pasteles is just wrong. I did not like them. I was totally disappointed with my pasteles order. I will not order them again nor will I go out of my way to eat at Casa Adela as the food is just ok."
8807,18,4,1,12/13/2014,"Spot on! Nothing better than realizing you have this place around the corner. But besides location bias, I have to say that the pernil was the best one I've ever had. Coming from Miami being exposed to this cuisine on a daily basis I have to say that hands down this is the best. Crunchy tostones and on point cafe con leche. I have found my soulmate in the east village."
8808,18,2,1,12/1/2014,"I will no longer be coming here, unfortunately, because the customer service is really bad. ˜I feel like if you do not speak Spanish they are through with you. ˜Even worse if you are Latin and do not speak Spanish-not my fault my parents never taught me, lol. ˜Anyways, their sanitation grade went from an A to a B (last time I saw), something that I judge before even eating at a restaurant. ˜I'll be finding a new authentic Puerto Rican restaurant. ˜If you know of one, please let me know! ˜Thanks!"
8809,18,5,1,11/30/2014,"Oh my GOSH !!! So I was undecided on what to eat and my sister in-law suggested ""Casa Adela"" We drove from Greenpoint to lower east side just over the bridge hoping to get some yummy food, I ordered the mofongo with pork and my hubby ordered the steak sandwich with opinions tomato ˜lettuce and mayo and holy gazoooo the Best everrrrr omg it hit every taste bud in my mouth and the environment is so Spanish so nice with different nationalities just eating away .... New spot just minutes away can't wait to come back again !"
8810,18,4,1,11/26/2014,"On 11/26/2014 ordered takeout - 2 Chicken Mofongos and 8 pasteles. The price $45.00 cash, they do not accept credit or debit. The food was delicious, flavorful, fresh."
8811,18,3,1,11/25/2014,"Let's just start off by saying I am not Puerto Rican, so I was not brought up eating this food (which, for the most part, is pretty good). ˜ I have been here a handful of times now and always order the beef stew with the arroz con gandules. Normally, the service is somewhat decent, but my last time there (Monday) was wretched. I'm thinking maybe it was because of the waitress (young girl) because we had never had her before. 1. She told us they were out of arroz con gandules. We were noticeably very disappointed. However, 20 minutes later we saw her take a plate of Arroz con gandules to another table, so we asked a different waitress if they had any left. The story then changed - they had enough for one serving. No apology. 2. They were out of beef stew, my favorite dish. Who knows if they really were, because she also said they were out of Arroz con gandules. 3. We were brought salads for appetizers. Not what we ordered. The waitress realized her mistake and took them back. No apology. 4. We were dining at the restaurant, but my friend also ordered something to go so he could eat it tomorrow. Well, of course they brought it out on a plate to eat at that moment. No apology. 5. It took us 45 minutes to get our food. 45 fucking minutes. No one ever once said ""your food is on the way"" or anything. A man came in, got his meal, paid and left within 20 min while we were still waiting. There was another man that ˜ordered ahead and came in to pick up his meal, but yet, he still sat there and waited 45 min. Another table was very vocal about how long it was taking for their meals to come out. Everything was just inconsistent. Listening to that table bitch and moan behind us wasn't a very great dining experience either. And of course... No apology. 6. Our meal finally comes. There's no Arroz con gandules included... after all that. I then had to remind her to bring it out. She forgot of course. No apology. 7. We ended up ordering a piece of flan to share. I shit you not, the piece of flan was probably a 2x2 square piece, even after knowing we were sharing it and we had the shittiest experience. We both got like 2 bites each out of it. That was the icing on the cake (no pun intended). Now I'm never usually this nitpicky, but there were way too many mistakes with no apologies and it really pissed me off -- enough not to return. Because of the fact I've been here a few other times and it wasn't terrible service, it saved them from getting 2 stars. Hands down the worst dining experience I've ever had."
8812,18,4,1,11/24/2014,"Awesome Puerto Rican food. I have been here three times and ordered various things off of the menu and I have never been disappointed. I ordered a mofongo and as soon as the order was put in I saw an old woman in the back (the owner?) smashing plantains in her pilon (mortar and pestle) which I thought was awesome. The waiter is so nice and friendly and makes excellent suggestions. The food takes a little longer to come out, but i'm sure its because the chef is putting the same touches on it that a family member cooking for someone would. ˜The prices are great, and the ambiance of the restaurant has a hard-to-describe Puerto-Rican feel to it. There is not a lot of seating so it's not very good for large groups, but i'm sure they'd be willing to accommodate if you call in advance. After a big meal you can sit back with a cafe con leche/coffe with milk, which they make very well here. 4 stars!!"
8813,18,5,1,11/23/2014,"The mofongo is hands down the best I have ever had. ˜Typical Puerto Rican muffing, moist, with pork meat and crackling skin inside! Yum! The sancocho is also hard core and with an authentic boricua flavor. ˜Dona Adela is always around giving instructions to his employees, which gives you a sense of her strong commitment to serving Puerto Rican food just the way it is. ˜Many ""Puerto Rican"" restaurants in the city have either a cuban or a dominican flavor to it, which is ok, I guess. But if you are looking for that ""abuelita"" flavor, this is the place to go."
8814,18,5,1,11/19/2014,"One con. Cash only. Other than that. All the food was amazing! Just like my grandma makes it! We had the mufungo, pernil, beef stew , arroz con gandolez. Plus chicken soup. It's amazing. Amazing. Amazing. Omg. Omg. ˜:-) I would go there every day. For every meal."
8815,18,3,1,11/10/2014,"The reason for a 3 star review instead of a 4 star is because their serving sizes are insanely small. In terms of flavor, Adela's has truly got a special thing going on but what's the point if you can expect to leave still feeling hungry! I've eaten here twice (once was dine-in and the other time as takeout) and personally love their Bacalau Guisado (cod fish stew) but its insulting how small their servings are, especially for a latin restaurant where big portions for hearty appetites are generally the expectation. Not so here. To give you a clearer idea, they fill an average sized coffee mug to measure out a cup of rice, a cup of beans and a cup of stew before plating! They take single serving to an absurd new low for restaurant dining. I generally always offer to share my dish with friends or at the very least look forward to taking home some leftovers anytime I go out. With servings being as small as they are you can't offer to share or expect any leftovers since there isn't enough on the plate to fill your own belly. If you order the meal as take-out their portions are exactly the same and as you can imagine the food doesn't fill the containers. I wish I had a picture of how ridiculous it looked. The containers looked half empty, not half full if you get what I'm saying. So yes, the food tastes good but for what you pay you can go to many other local latin restaurants (see my other reviews) where the portions and the price are much better aligned and the food tastes just as delicious. PASS!"
8816,18,4,1,11/10/2014,"This is as back home as it can get. Sub-par service: check. Plastic table covers with the Puerto Rico map place mats: check. Friends and family of the owners sitting around: check. Their food? Un-effin' believable. I always go for the mofongo and pernil, and their stuff is serious - as in, for $13 you'll have lunch and dinner in one seating. Good (and not so obvious) bonus? Its a BYOB friendly place, so you can bring your wine and beer along. Buen provecho!"
8817,18,4,1,10/15/2014,Good cheap Puerto Rican food. I've had lunch here a few times since it's right by my office. There's a bit of wait for your food but everything comes fresh and piping hot.
8818,18,5,1,10/9/2014,"The mofongo is in top 5 of the best things I have ever eaten in my entire life. Literally, the flavor is out of this world. ˜If you usually go with the roast chicken (or anything else) you must try the chicken stew. I'm never disappointed with the quality and deliciousness of the food."
8819,18,4,1,10/9/2014,"The best puertorican food I've ever had. I wish California had a decent ace like this. If we come back to visit NY, we will definitely come back here."
8820,18,5,1,10/8/2014,"So far I only ordered delivery but their rotisserie chicken is mind blowing. It comes with delicious rice and beans, perfectly delivered. I was keep ordering from Se?or Pollo before, but Casa Adela's seasoning made me switch to them. Highly recommended."
8821,18,5,1,9/29/2014,"Still the BEST Homemade Puerto Rican food in New York City. Adela still doing her thing and looking great after a recent trip to Puerto Rico. Adela sets a great tone. Having lunch or dinner here is like eating in someone's kitchen in PR, very casual, plus the TV's always tuned to Telemundo. Whatever you order, order it with Coconut Water as your beverage -- it's very refreshing. It's great to eat among such a nice family - bendiciones a La Reina Adela y todo persones de la casa!"
8822,18,5,1,9/15/2014,"I was craving mofongo one evening and luckily this place was close by. They were closing up in 15 min. so I called quickly to order take out. The people were neither very nice nor rude but my food was to go so I can't really comment too much on service. They were closing up when I got there so they could've been tired as well. When I got home, I practically devoured the entire dish, which came with some extra pork fat sauce for extra flavor. I also got the garlic sauce that everyone keeps commenting about. I will definitely be trying this place again and may even sit down for actual lunch/dinner service to try some other dishes. FYI - ordering the mofongo doesn't come with rice and beans so you'll need to order that separately."
8823,18,2,1,9/7/2014,"To summarize - disappointingly inconsistent. ˜We really want to like this place, as we're Puerto Rican and there aren't too many Puerto Rican sit-down restaurants in the city. ˜The girlfriend and I ate there a few months back and while she loved her dish (bacalao guisado / stewed cod fish) I thought my roast pork (pernil) was merely okay. ˜ Last night I was in the mood for the bacalao guisado, so we ordered it for delivery. ˜The food arrived quickly but it was bland, at best. It tasted nothing like what we had eaten our last time there. ˜Making matters worse was how expensive everything was! In total, for the two orders of bacalao and an order of steak and onions, we shelled out almost $52 (including tax and tip....) ˜ So, sadly, I think we're done with Casa Adela. ˜For much less money, we can get much better food from Rinconcito, the Dominican restaurant on 10th street. That said, Casa Adela has some of the best coffee and flan I've ever had, so maybe I'll have to split my time between the two; Rinconcito for the entree and CA for coffee and dessert!"
8824,18,4,1,8/31/2014,"Had flan and a cafecito. Delicious, creamy tasty just the right amount of everything. Will def come back to check out their meals. Jani says 5 stars for the ensalada de pulpo."
8825,18,3,1,8/12/2014,"Thought the food was ok. Place was pretty run-down. Yes it was pretty authentic puerto rican food, but honestly I have had better in many other places in this city. Ok if you are looking for that type of experience."
8826,18,5,1,8/10/2014,"The tostones were amazing... the rotisserie chicken was flavorful, pork was cooked perfectly, service was quick, and the cafe con leche was to die for."
8827,18,4,1,7/29/2014,My only regret is that I didn't come sooner I've been living in this neighborhood for a year and just tried it. ˜It's serves good out of mamas Puerto Rican kitchen- get the rice and beans and rotisserie chicken. I believe senior pollo on first Avenue has better chicken with a wonderful cilantro basil sauce but nonetheless this place is delicious. Great value!!
8828,18,5,1,7/26/2014,"Well, nothing to complain about... I was walking around the area, I saw this place and I decided to come check it out whenever I was around the area again. And that was today. I was born and raised in Cuba and I have never had Puerto Rican food before, but this was YUMMY!!! The place is small, and everyone is very friendly. It feels like the kitchen of your neighbour. The service is kind of slow, if you are in a rush it's better to say it from the beginning so they know and maybe do something. Once you order, they bring you the food by parts, first the side order, then the rice and bean, the meat, and so on. Be patient. Just think you are at a friend's house. We ordered the 1/2 Chicken, and the Mofongo con Pernil... They were delicious!!!!!!! They were so good and tasty that I do not have enough words to describe it. They say the specialize in the rotisserie chicken, but the Mofongo with Pernil was AWESOME!!!! The pork was fresh and delicious. In general, if you are in the area looking for a place to eat and do not want to break the bank, GO to Casa Adela! hmmmm, maybe I'd wish the flan was a bit bigger because a little square is not enough!!!!"
8829,18,5,1,7/26/2014,"Loved the mofongo, pernil and sancocho. Amazingly kind staff, great value, great place to cure a hangover or a longing for a home-cooked meal."
8830,18,1,1,7/22/2014,"I have been coming here for the past few years and every time my experience has been great but recently I was very disappointed in the service. ˜After my sister and I placed our order, the waitress tells us 25 minutes later that neither of our entrees were available. So I decided on another entree and ten minutes later the waitress brings only my side orders (salad & avocado). The waitress then disappeared for some which I became really annoyed, subsequently the owner saw that I was visibly upset and apologized on behalf of the waitress which comes to find out left for the night. Since the waitress didn't relate to the cook my complete order, the owner ˜offered to give me anything I wanted on the house but after sitting there starving for an hour, my sister and I decided to leave. In addition, the staff appeared unorganized and the establishment gets smaller and smaller. I won't be coming back here anymore."
8831,18,3,1,7/16/2014,"My first mofongo (with pernil) and it was delicious. ˜The waitress was pretty rude, seating someone before us who she appeared to know and grabbing bottles off our table without asking. ˜But the food was great."
8832,18,3,1,7/16/2014,"Still craving more puerto rican food from my last experience at ""Pasteles y algo mas"", I decided to try casa adela since it was closer to me. Yelp, I love you, but sometimes the reviews for these ˜restaurants are on crack! I absolutely did not see what the big fuss was about this restaurant! ˜I get better spanish food from the cuchifritos or even the grocery store sometimes! It smelled good upon walking it, but lacked authenticity. ˜I ordered the chicharron de pollo with yellow rice and red beans and a side order of potato salad. ˜The chicken was okay, I liked the the crust it had on it but wasn't made the traditional way. It was like they had dipped it into a batter as opposed to just frying it. The rice was normal and so were the beans. The potato salad killed me! I had high expectations that fell flat to the floor and got ran over by a truck. Absolutely nooooooo flavor whatsoever! ˜I was tempted to add salt, but I just left it. The bf ordered a sancocho soup, which he said was okay and a pernil sandwich. The poor pernil sandwich was dryer than the sahara. We asked for a mojo (garlic sauce) which they seemed to forget about. They had rotisserie chickens cooking which seemed to be popular, ˜but I don't know there's a thin line between jui y and dry when doing rotisserie. The waiter was really nice however, but search for puerto rican food in nyc continues."
8833,18,2,1,7/14/2014,"The restaurant was not as good as I was expecting it to be. The reviews on yelp were good, which led me to come here but my experience was not as good. I ordered a Pernil sandwich and a sancocho, the sancocho was good but the Pernil sandwich was dry. The staff was cool but a bit slow. I found the food to be ordinary and nothing special about it."
8834,18,5,1,7/9/2014,"Extremely flavorful food, despite its simplicity. I highly recommend the half chicken- which is quite literally the most delicious rotisserie chicken I've ever had (don't tell my mom!). I agree with the other postings that the wait can be a little long and the service can be a little slow, but it's well worth it. Even if I didn't live around the corner, I would make the effort whenever I was in the mood for a filling, inexpensive, Puerto Rican meal."
8835,18,4,1,5/20/2014,This was my first time trying Puerto Rican cuisine and I loved it! The restaurant is a very cute mom and pops place and you feel like you are at a family house. Everyone who worked there was very friendly and very sweet. They treated us very well and couldn't ask for better service. The food was delicious and we cleaned our plates. I would absolutely return and recommend everyone to check this restaurant out.
8836,18,2,1,5/20/2014,Food is not that great. Service sucks. They play favorites with their customers. Place is better when adela is there when she goes away look out cause when shes not there its a bust
8837,18,2,1,5/17/2014,"A nice small homey restaurant with a take-out counter and about 5 tables...yes it's very small but worth checking out if you live in the area. However if you do not, then this is really out of the way. The closest train and bus leaves you 15-20 min walk away. By the time you get there, there will be a 20-30 min wait for a table, especially on the weekends...which I wouldn't mind IF the food was out of the world...which it is certainly not. I'm not Puerto Rican but I've had much better PR food in the Bronx and on vacation in Puerto Rico. Their yellow rice is bland and not flavorful and the flan is just way off! When a spanish place doesn't get these two things right, then don't expect much from everything else on the menu. My monfongo was very good, the chicken was too dry and needed more seasoning, my friend's order of pernil with yellow rice and black beans came with more RICE than pernil; it came on a small dessert plate with 6 thin slices...where's the rest of my meal?!?! For $10 the pernil should be at least half a pound worth of meat because no one is paying $10 for rice and beans. Oh and as we were having the flan, our waiter comes up to us and goes ""sorry but we need the table after you finish your flan because it's Sat and there's people waiting""....REALLY?!?! SO the place is a long trek, dont take reservations, 20-30 mins wait only to have sub-par food and rushed to leave. And their cash only policy doesn't help either. TWO stars!"
8838,18,5,1,5/16/2014,"Authentic Puerto Rican cuisine that's mouth watering! I went with my friend and we couldn't stop raving about how well seasoned the food was. ˜I had chuletas frita with white rice and pink beans and my friend had 1/2 chicken with yellow rice and black beans. The prices are affordable and the service is great, I suggest you go without thinking twice!"
8839,18,4,1,5/7/2014,"They get 4 stars for food, but 1 star for phone etiquette and ordering/delivery attempts via phone."
8840,18,5,1,5/2/2014,Omg!!! Let me tell you Puerto Rican food at its finest!! Pernil(pork) is so melt in your mouth moist!! Natural squeezed orange juice goes down smooth like sailin' im telling you! Hidden gem in NYC. Coming from a Puerto Rican background...this is what COMIDA should taste like!!! Bendicion y Buen Provecho!!!
8841,18,4,1,4/16/2014,"Great little spot for some delicious spanish food. It was raining out and before heading over to Pitt Street I decided to stop in for the pernil. The service was fast and friendly, didn't even need to look at the menu. I had the yellow rice with red beans and roasted pork. The pernil was very well seasoned with nice cuts of meat. The beans came in a coffee mug with a side plate of ˜yellow rice! Just took some hot sauce and shook it all over the pork, in the beans and on the rice. The rice wasn't overly seasoned just needed some salt, but after the splash of hot sauce oohhh boy this food is lively. Muy bueno!!!"
8842,18,5,1,3/24/2014,"Went here last Friday with my Puerto Rican boyfriend. I had the chicken stew which came with rice and beans. Delicious!!! It reminded me of my childhood when visiting friends and their Mom would put a plate in front of me and watch this Irish girl eat. I can't wait to go back. Great prices, too."
8843,18,5,1,3/22/2014,"I've been looking for a decently priced Puerto Rican restaurant for quite a while. I've been trying different places in search for a restaurant that mirrors my grandmothers' cooking because I want to invite a few of my friends that have never tried Puerto Rican food. I was born and raised in Puerto Rico so I have high standards. I'm not looking for something that looks good on a plate; I'm looking for something cheap, authentic, and delicious. Okay, enough background info. Now to the review. FOOD: I wasn't expecting much from this place but I was pleasantly surprised. I ordered pernil which came with a side of rice (white, yellow, or yellow with green peas) and beans (red, pink, or black). I went with the white rice and pink beans. I also ordered a mofongo. I shared the meal with my date and the bill came out to be around $20. The food was great and authentic; it was very similar in taste to what my grandmothers make at home when I visit them in Puerto Rico. SERVICE: The server was attentive and polite. SEATING: The place has six tables with about 20 chairs. On a busy day it might be harder to seat large groups but I went at around 6pm on a weekday and there was no wait. Overall: 5 stars! I recommend this place to anyone that wants an authentic taste of Puerto Rico in NYC. BTW, CASH ONLY!"
8844,18,4,1,3/21/2014,"No-nonsense stop for Puerto Rican food - granted, I've never had Puerto Rican food in my life and have no idea what to compare it to. All I know is what I ate here was delicious as hell. A friend of mine introduced me to Casa Adela and we went and split an order of the roast pork with rice and black beans. There's a $3 charge for sharing (even though our waitress stated $2, 3 was on the bill), but we don't eat much (two Asian girls) so I didn't mind. The prices are fairly low anyway. The dish came out in a matter of minutes (pretty quick). They gave us an extra plate without us having to ask, which I always note because a lot of places, even more upscale ones, won't do that without being prompted. The beans come in a mug, which is kind of cute, and makes it easy to pour over the rice. The pork is so soft and rich, it pretty much melts in your mouth. The rice and beans are well seasoned, although I added some of the hot sauce provided at each table because I like my food to be spicy. Overall, the dish was delicious and so comforting, you'd think you'd grown up with a Puerto Rican grandmother. The place is small and casual, there's a tv running Spanish speaking television programs in the background, and you basically feel like you're in someone's house. I left thinking about my next trip back."
8845,18,5,1,3/21/2014,"I love every meal I've had there. It's my kind of place- hole in the wall with questionably sanitation but super authentic Puerto Rican. I know this bc (I have a knack for these dirty hole in the wall places) and there was a Puerto Rican family reunion taking up 75% of the restaurant and they totally said that in comparison to the more well known Puerto Rican restaurant in Bew York, they thought this was more like grandma's cooking! I loved the first and second dish - pork with rice and beans & chicken with rice and beans. Tried the mofongo but if wasn't very used to the combination of garlic with plaintains and a salty sauce. But I want to try their plaintain chips and pork chops next time! And if you bring a large group, you can split their family style rotisserie chicken (it's their customer favorite)"
8846,18,4,1,2/12/2014,"Great mom and pop's place with authentic Puerto Rican food that doesn't hurt your wallet. Good attentive service with a personal touch. they also have a GREAT red pepper sauce. It definitely has kick but tastes so fresh, like freshly pur?ed peppers. I had the 1/2 rotisserie chicken and the meat fell off the bone. Great flavor that went well with the generous portions of beans and rice. We got the flan as a dessert but it was rather overwhelming, a lot heavier and richer than the standard flan, almost cheesecake like. This place has free delivery and also a near BYOB policy! (limit 1 bottle per table)"
8847,18,4,1,1/26/2014,"I had the Mofongo which was really good! In other restaurants it is sometimes dry, but here it was pretty moist, and they also give you a side of garlic butter sauce! Also, the staff were all very friendly."
8848,18,1,1,1/17/2014,"Terrible service! ˜Casa Adela serves excellent food but the service was downright racist. I'm almost certain we were racially profiled for being WHITE. ˜ I am far from that woman who thinks everyone is a racist or out to get me. I was born in east Harlem to a Jewish mother and Puerto Rican father. I brought a friend with me to eat ˜some authentic Puerto Rican food. Aside from my abuela, Casa Adela is pretty close to having the best rice and beans in Manhattan. You can imagine how excited I was to introduce my friend to an important part of my culture and heritage. When we sat down I was told by a female waitress that they didn't serve alcohol but I was welcomed to bring my own wine and beer. I went to the bodega on the corner and got a 6 pack of corona. I asked for a bottle opener and we began drinking. After we were served our delicious food, we had another waiter, a male, who kept pushing the check on us. He was very aggressive. It was obvious that he was rushing us out. Although the restaurant was busy, it was not crowded. No one was waiting for a table. After being accosted by our waiter for the 3rd time, my friend paid the check. When we went to open our last beer, we noticed the bottle opener was gone. I got up and asked our waiter for the bottle opener and immediately he said ""YOUR TABLE IS CLOSED."" We kept asking why--again no one was waiting for the table, if that was the case, we would have left without a problem. ˜We asked if we could finish our beer and if someone showed up wanting the table, we'd leave without hesitation. ˜He immediately said, no. He went on to say that since we paid our bill, the table was officially closed and we couldn't finish our LAST beer. We realized this was why he kept pushing the bill on us--we were drinking alcohol that they weren't making money on, so by rushing us out, they could clean the table and hopefully serve new customers. But again, there weren't any new customers waiting for the table!!! There were many other customers, all Hispanic, who were eating and drinking, taking their time and not once were they pushed to pay their bill or finish their food. The Hispanic couple next to us even said it was strange how we were being targeted. I'm almost certain that if I spoke Spanish or looked a certain way, perhaps more Hispanic, we wouldn't have been treated so poorly. It's 2013 and I live in NYC! I thought we were way past this kind of behavior. When I called this morning to speak with Adela and/or Adela's son, who I know to be very nice, our waiter answered. He wouldn't let me speak with anyone and immediately hung up on me. ˜ Yes, the food is great. Walking into Casa Adela reminds me of being in my abuela's kitchen. However, the way my friend and I were treated, I will never go back. I strongly encourage anyone who eats here to ask about their alcohol policy BEFORE you sit down eat. Sadly I will never return to Casa Adela."
8849,18,5,1,12/27/2013,We ate lunch at a great Puerto Rican Spot called Casa Adela's. ˜The wife had Pernil Asado and I had Chicken Guisado. We also had Maduros and I tried a drink called Morir Sonando which reminded me of the Orange Cream Cooler I had at Olga's a couple days earlier. Everything was absolutely excellent and we both agreed that it was one of the best meals that we had on our two week East Coast Trip.
8850,18,4,1,12/26/2013,The best Boruiqua food in NYC. Only complaint is the service can be slow at times but I guess in a weird way it adds to the Old School charm of this spot. The Sancocho is unreal. I grew up eating PR food and this takes me home! My favorite cheap eats in the East Village.
8851,18,1,1,11/10/2013,"Just got back to South Jersey from visiting a relative in NYC. We decided to eat at Casa Adela for dinner. We have been there once before. The mofongo was good but it was not what I had ordered. I ordered a plain mofongo with extra garlic and I receive a mofongo with pernil. I let that go, they made a little mistake. I'll pay the extra money for the pernil. ˜ I asked at the beginning if they had white rice with beans, and I was told that they only had arroz con gandules. So I said ""no thank you"", and just went with the mofongo. ˜Later, as I'm eating my meal the waitress brings white rice and beans. ˜""Ok I'll take the rice and beans home"", I said to myself, even though I no longer wanted the rice and beans. When we get the check, the waitress had charged us $12 extra. I had her add the check and she came up with the wrong number herself, but continued to say that she was right. Since we had six people in our group, we were charged 18% tip which it was fine, but she charge us 18% plus and extra $12. ˜The owner's son came to the register and gave me my money, but they were making me feel like I was in the wrong. I even had someone else add it up, and they were wrong. ˜Last time I was there, the owner, Adela was cooking in the kitchen, and the service was much better. Maybe her presence makes a big difference in the service. I will never go there again. The customer service was horrible. If you go there, make sure that your food order and your bill is correct."
8852,18,2,1,11/2/2013,"My wife is Puerto Rican so I wanted to check out a different place while we were in the City (Jersey folks). ˜First off, the neighborhood was sketchy, Wife is from Jersey City so its not like we don't know the ""inner city element"" ,not that bad, but not the greatest if you have to park 2-3 blocks away from the place. We decided to grab & go. Mofongo was ""15 minute wait. No big deal. We waited, talked etc.That 15 min. turns out to be closer to 30 min. (this is after wife goes into the restaurant to eye ball the workers.) Now the good part, ˜we ˜get our order & we drive to mid-town to meet some people. This is were we notice that the Pernil that we also ordered wasn't even in the bag. Are You kidding me? $18 bucks for 2/3 of a meal. Oh Well, I guess you have to check your ˜food & do their job for them. Place wasn't that busy. I didn't even eat any of the food ˜to rate it. Wife said it was good/authentic. Whatever. Word to the wise, check your order."
8853,18,3,1,10/27/2013,The place was a little hard to find because it's not near any subway station. ˜The food there was incredible though. ˜I was filled up and I was satisfied with my meal. ˜The reason why it gets three stars is because of its terrible service. ˜It had a homely feel but not necessary in a good way. ˜The waitresses were arguing in Spanish on who had to take our table. ˜The food took so long to arrive and my mom never got her meal. ˜There wasn't a lot of room to sit so were were a little bunched in. ˜I think think this is a great place to eat if you just want to take out but not if you want to sit down.
8854,18,5,1,10/16/2013,"Amazing chicken, everything tastes like it was slow cooked in my Abuela's kitchen. So happy to still find some authentic Puerto Rican flavors in LES; gentrification hasn't managed to destroy everything!"
8855,18,4,1,10/16/2013,Very enjoyable dinner in a comfortable setting. The sancocho was delicious. My wife loved how they prepared the yuca. Salad was nothing special. Platanos were great.
8856,18,4,1,10/4/2013,"I've walked past this place loads of times since it is right around the corner from my son's school. I was hungry, had some time before I needed to pick him up so decided to go in. I am not Spanish, but love Spanish Caribbean food. For the most part, I've only had homemade Dominican and Cuban food. However, I enjoy trying different cuisines and this place looked really tasty. Even though it was hot out, I ordered the sancocho (I could eat soup every day) and tostones. The soup was good laden with various root vegetables and meat. I wish there was a little more pumpkin and cassava, but that is my preference. The broth, too, was good, but could have been richer and heated up a little more for my liking. The standouts were the tostones. After the waitress brought them to the table, she asked if I'd like some garlic to accompany them. Being a garlic fiend, I, of course, said yes. Oh my gosh. The combination of freshly made right off the stove tostones, so crisp and perfectly fried and salted, with the crushed garlic in oil dip, was amazing. If it was socially acceptable to lick the container the garlic came in, I would have. Be warned though, eating a whole container of garlic will lead to dragon fire breath. When I picked up my son from school I was praying that I would not run into any parents who wanted to chit chat. The meal was extremely filling yet I somehow managed to demolish everything. I cannot wait to go back and try the other dishes. As for service and ambiance, they are fine. The waitress who took my order was helpful answering my questions and checking in to see if I needed anything, but not overly friendly. The inside is cute, on the small side, not fancy, but comfortable. Initially I was the only one there (went on a weekday 2pm ish). Within about 15 minutes 3 other tables got filled. I imagine it'd get packed pretty quickly on the weekend. This seems like a great, authentic local place. I liked that when I paid the lady at the register spoke to me in Spanish even though I am clearly not Spanish."
8857,18,2,1,9/30/2013,"Few of us passed by this cute place which looks authentic. We decided to go in and tried it. The food was good but portion is small comparing to other PR food in NYC, specially beans which served in small tea cup. ˜The service is terrible. Our waiter is rude when severing our food and taking our orders. Maybe PR people gets better service. We definitely will not go back or recommend it to others."
5612,18,4,1,9/24/2013,"I don't have a Puerto Rican grandmother. My grandmother is old school Chinese and whenever she has us over for dinner, the small wooden dinner table we sit around is always at risk of imminent collapse from the weight of all the dishes that come out of the kitchen. We gorge ourselves on her ancestral cooking like the filial descendents that we are, and then, to put insult on top of gastronomic injury, we binge on blue bell ice cream and seasonal fruits afterwards. When everyone is satisfied and teetering on the edge of a clinical coma, we drive home, faculties clearly impaired from hyperglycemia, vision handicapped by the tower of tupperware sitting on our laps, the delicious smell of fresh leftovers wafting below our noses, enticing us to steal just another bite. If you know what this feels like, you know what it's like to eat at Casa Adela. This is a no frills kitchen where food comes first. There are no locally-sourced 100% grass fed beefsteaks here, nor are there any self-righteous, aesthetically ironic hipsters to serve them to you. This is old school Puerto Rican eats at old school Puerto Rican prices. Pernil, Cubano sandiwches, rice and beans. When I go out to eat at restaurants, I feel the clear distinction between patron and staff. I feel the need to be served, to be pleased, to be entertained. When I eat here, I feel the need to help clear the table afterwards and make everyone some coffee. That's the kind of place this is, and that's nothing bad."
8016,18,5,1,9/9/2013,"Came here on a Saturday evening around 6pm. Was excited to try the rotisserie chicken and mofongo since everyone gave it such good reviews. However, they said the chicken wasn't ready and that i would have to wait an hour! Decided to wait anyway. This is the 1st time having mofongo, so i have nothing to compare it against but it was damn good. Tons of flavor. I got the side of the roast pork which was also full of flavor. The chicken steals the show. Probably some of the best rotisserie chicken i've had anywhere. Completely juicy and loaded with flavor. The first bite almost knocked me out. Comes with a side of rice and beans and the 1/2 chicken is huge. $9.00 for it. Mofongo was $7, but totaled me $13 with the roast pork. Portions are huge, prices are great, and it's BYOB. Will definitely be coming back again and again."
8858,18,5,1,9/8/2013,Best Puerto Rican food in the city!
8859,18,5,1,8/4/2013,"The food here is like eating at your grandmother's kitchen counter. Authentic, generous and jam packed with love and flavor. The mofongo is especially excellent with the chicharrones. Also the BYOB option is excellent! THANKS for an amazing meal!"
8860,18,5,1,7/20/2013,"This place is the shiiiiiiiit. Been coming here for a few years, best meal in the neighborhood for under 20 bucks hands down!"
8861,18,1,1,7/13/2013,Who the hell decides to fumigate on Friday night when there are customers in the restaurant ? Casa Adela !
8862,18,1,1,6/27/2013,"regular stuff, nothing to cry about i paid $40 for terrible service (the food was brought out when i asked for it and in the incorrect order) and i couldve made this at home in 5 minus. terrible alcapurrias. this is new yorican food not real puerto rican food ... waste of time try YUCA just around the corner ... so much more flavor and excellent service."
8863,18,5,1,6/24/2013,"The most satisfying dinner of the past few months. ˜Pull out $20 from the ATM, grab a buddy and a sixer of Modelo from the bodego next door, then pop in for some mofongo. ˜You're gonna want to use the extra $4 for a tip, if only to say it was the best 20 bucks you ever spent. Sure, the food didn't make me cream my jeans, but it did help me overcome my fear of mofongo, perhaps the least dignified of national delicacies -- ˜a sticky, starchy lump of plantains and fried pork chunks that is usually so dry it takes a whole pitcher of gravy to allow a fork to pass through it. ˜Casa Adela's was perfectly moist and came with an awesome garlic butter sauce, full of all sorts of spices -- I got monfongo'd. The biggest sell, though, is the atmosphere -- it's an authentic neighborhood dirty spoon, the cooks standing at the counter drinking beer and cracking jokes between orders. ˜English is a second language here, which is fine because I love going to restaurants where I can practice my Spanish and not feel like a prick. ˜BYOB, pay at the register, and hairnets is my gold standard from now on, assuming there's also some rice and beans floating around the room."
8864,18,2,1,6/24/2013,"They ran out of rice, and the food was alright. People who give it 5 stars obviously don't know good food. The service was horrific, and that's an understatement."
8865,18,5,1,6/8/2013,This is a real Puerto Rican family Resturante and with the best food made by Adela for more than 30 years in Loisaida! Amazing!
8866,18,5,1,5/12/2013,Mofongo. ˜Just.... mofongo. ˜The pollo. ˜The everything. ˜Everything is delicious. ˜I love that I feel like I'm walking into a Puerto Rican kitchen and you have aunties in the back cooking for you. ˜It's a hole in the wall and I LOVE that. ˜Good food. ˜Good prices.
8867,18,4,1,4/11/2013,"You can't go wrong with latin rotisserie chicken and yellow rice & beans. ˜ I do prefer the chicken at Pio Pio and Pio Pio Rico, but the chicken at Casa Adela is MUCH, MUCH better than other latin spots in the neighborhood ˜I've got to go back and try the mofongo."
8868,18,4,1,4/9/2013,like being in the island... love Adela whoever she is...
8869,18,5,1,3/24/2013,"Had them cater my sons birthday party. ˜Amazing rotisserie chicken and superb pernil. Reasonably priced, super friendly staff."
8870,18,3,1,3/11/2013,"I'd like to give this place another try, but my cuban sandwich wasn't very good. ˜My buddy's stew was good though. ˜Place was super cheap, staff was nice, and a fun atmosphere; maybe I just didn't order well; hope so."
8871,18,3,1,3/3/2013,The prices on some of their items was outdated. Also charged me extra because I was taking out. The mofongo is good here. Not the best neighborhood.
8872,18,5,1,2/22/2013,"This place serves all my favorite foods (chicken, rice, beans) and it does so in an outstanding, unpretentious style. ˜If you're polite about it, and offer to share, the friendly staff will even let you bring a bottle of booze to compliment your feast, if you please. ˜I always leave satisfied, and extremely happy!!!"
8011,18,4,1,2/10/2013,"When first came into this little restaurant the place was half full, it wasn't until I was waiting for my food that I realized that I was the only customer there, they all worked there or were friends hanging out. I think that's pretty much the laid back Puerto Rican culture and I'm perfectly ok with that. I thought it was endearing that a couple old ladies were sitting one of the tables peeling garlic spending time with each other. I think that kind of love of culture translates to the food here. I've only been here once but I was so happy with my mofongo (about $8) that I'll definitely be back. Most of the meals here are $7-13 so it's definitely an affordable place to make return trips. It's not a fancy place so don't expect the most attentive service or a romantic atmosphere, just classic latin food done well. Back to that mofongo. It was made 100% by scratch to order and was incredibly flavorful and unlike others I've had, moist. It's listed under apps but no normal person could eat it and still get a full meal afterwards."
8873,18,5,1,2/2/2013,"By far, being born and raised in Lower East Side, I praise this place the way I praise the hood. It's a staple. ˜ The chicken here is seasoned so phenomenally, it makes you want to hug your abuela, as if you're dining there, you'll bound to see the old school locals come in and hug and yell at each other lovingly as if you was back in the isla, just kickin' it and eating good food. The mofongo is monstrously delicious, the porkchops are fried and juicy somehow. Nothing here is not worth trying. EXCEPTIONALLLLLLLLLLLLLL..... Except the service which is painfully slow but if you stare at your waitress while she's on the move, you realize it's cuz they run the whole show (food prep and all that good jazz) so with the best Puerto Rican food in NYC, gotta earn that plate and be patient. Brush up on your spanish and you can chat up the owner/abuela (Goddess of Casa Adela) while you wait. ˜Oh snap, I almost forgot- Don't front on the chicharron de pollo, shit is sizzling crack, i am super in love with bone in chicharrons and this place got it and makes it with MAGIC. smacks you right in the mouth while you chew. Home is now at Casa Adela."
8874,18,5,1,1/21/2013,"delicious and cheap prices. ˜service was a bit slow, but family run and very friendly! i just had the pork chops with yellow rice and black beans... so good. ˜we noticed a lot of folks coming in for pick up, i think the rotisserie chicken is a popular item. ˜lunch for two came out to under $20. ˜ do it!"
8875,18,5,1,1/13/2013,Two words: 1) Phenomenal. 2) Mafongo. Can't wait to go back. Sweetest people.
8876,18,4,1,12/25/2012,It's getting harder to find home style Puerto Rican restaurants in NYC but Casa Adele is going strong. We had the mofongo with pernil and tostones. They really hit the spot. They even had some local folks playing drums and singing traditional songs. I am giving them 4 stars because no one's pernil or rice and beans is as savory as my mother-in-law's. We have found our new regular haunt in the city after the closure of Papasito's in midtown.
8877,18,4,1,12/16/2012,Don't miss it. ˜Really authentic Puerto Rican food. ˜ The best rotisserie ˜chicken I've ever eaten. Perfectly seasoned n moist. ˜Worth double the price. Comes with large portion. Of rice and beans. ˜Chicarones de pollo was great . Prices can't be beat. Don't pay attention to ambience. ˜It's small but clean.
8878,18,5,1,12/9/2012,"Lets just start by saying saying time i come here i leave happy and full. Get the roast pork with the gandules and black beans!! The sweet plantains are a good plate to share between 2 people and the flan is really good. Food is just really good and authentic. Very family run feel, really nice and friendly."
8879,18,5,1,11/27/2012,"superb & AUTHENTIC mofongo, reasonable prices. ˜The location is a pain in the rear, but worth it!"
8880,18,5,1,11/25/2012,Best puertorican restaurant. ˜authentic puertorican dishes and fresh made. ˜Small but confy. ˜Staff and music makes you feel like you in Puerto Rico.
8881,18,4,1,11/24/2012,"I usually come here on my lunch break since it's near the school I student teach at. It's a cute little familiy-owned restaurant that reminds me a lot of the bomb Mexican food places back home in LA. Plus: I get their 1/2 chicken and rice every time. Most often than not, they give me so much that I can't even finish it! Parts of the chicken is dry, but the juicier, tender parts are to die for. The white rice tastes like it was cooked with chicken broth, which adds an additional savory flavor to it. I come here so often, the waitresses have memorized my order! The wait for your food is typically not that long. Their black beans are so good and I don't even really like beans all that much! Delta: Sometimes, seating is hard to come by. Luckily, during lunch time, I can usually grab a seat and eat a quick meal. The arrangement of the seating is kind of weird, and when you're closer to the door, the draft gives you a chill whenever it opens. Ratings Service - 1 Food - 1 Environment - 0.5 Price - 0.5 Experience - 1 Overall = 4"
8882,18,5,1,11/19/2012,"Very cheap, very delicious, authentic, and friendly. I am not sure what else you need... If you like food from this region of the world then you will like Casa Adela. For a more detailed review, read the review directly below this one. Couldn't agree with it more."
8883,18,5,1,10/24/2012,Super authentic and good. I can imagine this is how it feels to be in PR at some local joint.
8884,18,4,1,9/22/2012,I could eat an entire meal of just the yellow rice and red beans. Rotisserie chicken and steak with onions are both excellent
8885,18,5,1,9/7/2012,"After finally moving into the neighborhood, I decided to make Casa Adela my first spot to try with the family. My dad is puertorican so I didn't want him to be disappointed so I'm so glad that it was amazing! We came around 6 on Labor Day and it was packed so had to wait a few minutes for a table for 5. There's probably 5 or 6 tables so it shouldn't be too bad of a wait if you just walk in. The menu was pretty straightforward for those familiar with the cuisine, but unfortunately they were running low on a lot of the items. ˜To start, we ordered alcapurrias, ensalada de pulpo (octopus salad -- SO delicious, will definitely reorder), and chicharron de pollo (fried chicken -- warning that the appetizer size is a LARGE plate). The appetizers were pretty filling so didn't leave too much room for the entrees. Orders around the table included 3 of the pernil asado (they were running low so I think our portion sizes may have been smaller than normal), 1/2 pollo, and the chicharron de pollo entree. Everything came with rice and beans. Sadly they were out of the yellow rice, but whatever, I was hungry and white rice would have to do. You also get a choice of red or black beans. Make sure to get the cafe con leche. So delicious. The flan wasn't ready though so we couldn't get any. Guess just a reason to come back! I'm giving Adela 5 stars in hopes that the next time I go they have everything and it's just as delicious as I imagine."
8886,18,4,1,8/18/2012,"For the past few years, my life mission has been to find authentic Puertorrican food. I was born and raised in PR, and moved to the States 4 years ago. Call me sentimental... but my body craves this food. I found Casa Adela after an Internet search. It's close enough to my place, so I decided to give it a try. -Food: Spot on. Adela herself was there in the kitchen. We had Rotisserie chicken (juicy and delicious) with tostones. Surprisingly, they had ""Mayo-Ketchup""... My fellow Island Puertorricans surely understand. Also, had mofongo. I've had better mofongo, but this was good. It's consistency was more like Dominican mangœ, rather than mofongo (which I can understand given that this place is more of a fusion of both cuisines). White rice and red beans were delicious. -Service: This is where it's lacking. I called, and asked for take out. They said they usually don't provide this service, but they would make an exception for me (was it because I was ordering in Spanish? Not sure.) This took me by surprise, as both Yelp and Menupages state that they DO have take out. Anywhooo.... They took my order (which included Octopus salad) and phone number. They said it would take 15 min. Got there about 20 min later. Food was not ready, and to my surprise (again), no octopus. Should they have called or let me know before? I ordered an avocado salad instead, which was just that... lettuce with an avocado on top. After an additional 15 min wait, my food was ready (although I almost left without tostones if I hadn't checked the containers). They guy that took my order, made up for all of this by telling me to ask for him if I ever want take out again. -Overall: Puertorrican food rules, and this place delivers (not literally apparently). Would come back, but only with patience on my side."
8887,18,5,1,8/15/2012,"Born and raised Puerto Rican, I didn't move to the states till I was 18. It is always difficult to find an authentic Puerto Rican restaurant, not Dominican or Cuban, but Puerto Rican. And Casa Adela is just that! They have anything you could want from a Puerto Rican restaurant: alcapurrias, arroz con gandulez, mofongo con caldo, sancocho, and so much more. EVERYTHING on the menu is delicious and home made. For Thanksgiving we brought in our Turkey and they seasoned it the Puerto Rican way and we brought it back home and baked it in our apt... and it was delicious as well!!! It is cash only, really cheap, BYOB perfection...."
8888,18,4,1,8/5/2012,"When I first walked in I thought it was going to be the same old over-seasoned Puerto Rican food that you would get at the local Cuchifrito. To my surprise, the food was excellent. I went there with a few guys from work and all had good things to say about the food. The wait is a little longer than your average PR or Dominican restaurant but well worth it. Everything is fresh and seasoned perfectly. The staff is friendly and the LES history covers its walls. The seating is limited and the place kind of tight. They only accept cash, but who cares? The food is great."
8889,18,5,1,7/24/2012,"Well, Well, Well....Authentic Rican food is something to be very proud of. ˜This place is small and unassuming until you taste the food and you realize that it is FINE dining! ˜CASH ONLY. ˜Laundrymat across the street dispenses cash upon inserting debit card =) Small tables become quaint tables. ˜Cluttered spaces become an eclectic and island style. ˜ They are smart, they hand you two small plastic cups for the carafe of water they leave with you. ˜There is a pretty decent size menu with meat, chicken and fish available. ˜I chose the bacala with a tomato sauce and bay leaves, ˜Yuka (casava) ˜and onions, bacala and yellow rice con gandules (pigeon peas). ˜Hubbie ordered their soup with root vegetables. The soup was ok. ˜I know someone who makes a mean Honduran soup so I compare everything to that. ˜AND my mother makes an awesome soup too. ˜So the soup was OK. The bacala was awesome with the rice, beans and yuka. ˜The bacala came with the rice and beans and the yuka was a side order. ˜More than enough carbs to keep me going until our late night stop at Hot Pot Buffet in Boston at 11pm. Totally great place, will be back just to try other items on the menu. ˜ They have pasteles available for purchase by the 1/2 dozen. ˜Awesome."
8890,18,5,1,7/13/2012,The best Mofonggo!! Made fresh everytime you order. No wonder it has won so many awards. Mofonggo and roast pork (Pernil) is a perfect combintation. The pork chops and yellow rice with red beans were also great. Even the Cafe con Leche was perfect. To top it all is friendly service. Everyone is ready for a chat and will constantly check to see if you need anything. Priced well. Worth every penny.
8891,18,4,1,7/3/2012,"I typically, usually, who am I kidding, always get the 1/2 pollo with yellow rice and red beans. I stop by for dinner from time to time - just for take out - and they package everything so nicely. Definitely recommended - the best Spanish food I've had! I'm not sure if the rating changes but during the daytime it's a C but it changes to A at night? Odd."
8892,18,4,1,6/16/2012,"Casa Adela is one of the better Spanish restaurants the city has to offer. It's a much cheaper alternative to heavy hitters Don Coqui, Sofrito and Sazon. It's just as good as those three as well. I've never been disappointed after eating a meal here. I've eaten the pork chops, roast pork, fried chicken, chicken stew, roast chicken and octopus salad from Casa Adela. All of those dishes are delicious! The octopus salad is wonderful! If you are a fan of such dishes, it's a must try. The food here is made from the heart. It's similar to the yummy home cooked meal that only certain Puerto Rican abuelas can make. This place does not have many seats and the restaurant tends to fill up fast,especially in the evening. Come early if you want to dine in. The restaurant was also featured and profiled on the Food Network by Aaron Sanchez. If you are in the lower east side and want some good affordable Spanish food, go visit Casa Adela."
8893,18,4,1,5/28/2012,"The food was slamming!!!! Unfortunately, it doesnt get 5 stars because of the tight seating space. My friend and I came here during the Memorial weekend ˜just hanging out in the city. Its a small restaurant with very few tables. When we arrived there was a large party already sitting and took up most of the space in the restauant. After reading the rave reviews on Yelp about their rotisisserie chicken, I had to order them. I also had some rice and peas and my friend and I also had the audacity to order the Monfongo. Uhm, Uhm, Uhm, it was alll soooo delicious. The chicken was juicy, tender and just hit the spot. The rice and peas were cooked well and very tasty. I really didnt have enough room to eat the monfongo we ordered but after eating a few pieces I couldnt stop. All I have to say is wow, I am very impressed especially with their affordable prices. I was able to take food home and it was just as good the next day for lunch. I will definitely return to the lil spot and taste some other items on the menu."
8894,18,5,1,5/12/2012,"Basically, I love this place. I want to bottle the delicious rotisserie chicken smell coming from their kitchen and scent my whole life with it. I want to serve their chicken at my wedding, and make everyone eat it at my funeral. That's how good it is. In all reality, their rotisserie chicken is awesome, but their Mofongo is pretty much equally amazing. Delicious lump of plantains and garlic and roast pork. Their flan is also pretty amazing. I am making myself hungry just writing about it."
8895,18,5,1,5/6/2012,"Now I can't comment on the interior or the service as I've never sat down and ate inside and my friend picked up the takeout order, but the rotisserie chicken was really outstanding. ˜We spiced it up a bit with some Yucateco habanero sauce (as is our wont) but it's bursting with flavor even without using your condiments at home. ˜Rice and beans were pretty much perfect. ˜I'd love to try some tostones or mofongo for a more PR meal as I'm sure they must do them right but cot damn this was some delicious chicken. ˜ And here's an idea for people whining about the service or the this or the that. ˜Get your food takeout and you can go be miserable by yourself in your apartment without having to deal with other people and then coming to some website to have a whine about it. ˜When you come to a small place like this, you come for the authentic cuisine not for somebody to put a napkin on your lap for you."
8896,18,5,1,5/4/2012,"Sweet baby jeebus why did I wait so long to come here! My first real experience with Puerto Rican food was here and it was glorious! I went with a friend on a Saturday night around 8 and we were seated right away. Though, while we were there a lot of parties had to wait as the place is very small. We ordered some tostones, mofongo with pork, and 1/2 rotisserie. I was in heaven! The mofongo was especially my favorite. I loved the family environment and our server came by several times to ask if we were good and to ask specifically how we liked the food. It's also BYOB, but don't get crazy. My buddy and I bought two big beers and shared that..but I'd avoid bringing a 6 pack since....well we were told they frown upon that. Also, the price is PERFECT! See you in Alphabet City!"
8897,18,4,1,4/25/2012,"Wow. This place is something to rave about. A teeny tiny mom & pop restaurant with maybe 5-6 tables... the service is really above par, where they're super friendly, welcoming and helpful. The food took a little while, but it was worth the wait. 4 tiny girls had a table full of appetizers, our own dishes and sides. The mofongo tasted different than in PR but I enjoyed all of it (w/ pernil) and kept saying it was delicious everytime I grabbed for more. Tostones were cooked perfectly where the outside was crispy and the inside was plantainlicious. I had the breaded chicken which was simple but amazingly crispy and light. It's also BYOB, but like other reviews say, they only allow one bottle of wine at a time... they were going to charge $9 to open our second one but that could be because we were close to closing time and they didn't want us to linger. Friend forgot her phone on the table and they ran after us too. Really friendly staff with food to die for (and extremely affordable)"
8898,18,4,1,4/4/2012,"The food is tasty, fresh and very authentic. Growing up Puerto Rican, I have an affinity for this type of food and I can be pretty critical if not done right, but no worries here. The staff is friendly, service is quick and attentive the only drawback is that it's tight quarters, but I guess some would say its intimate. Try the fried chicken chunks. And I can still taste the garlic a day later when you have the tostones."
8899,18,4,1,3/12/2012,"I came here by the recommendation of my friend's mom who is a lovely Puerto Rican lady who cooks wonderful food.Very highly recommended!! This was the first time I tried PR food. I went with a couple of friends and they tried the pork and chicken.I had a bite of that ˜(not eating that kind of meat these days, but oh, I want to try sometimes new flavors) and it was delicious! But trying to be a good pesciterian, I ordered rice, beans and papaya juice. Well...it was super good!! I am getting use to be disappointed with vegetarian side dishes but this was great meal, super tasty. I ordered the papaya juice without milk though, just as I am used to drink it. The portions are gigantic, so beware, I recommend to share. The place is tiny too, and there are no reservations so allow some time to wait for a table. Totally worthy though!"
8900,18,4,1,3/3/2012,"The food was excellent, service--could be better. Though it's BYOB, we were only permitted to open one bottle of wine (to share between 6 people) because they didn't want us to stay long (their words). I respect that, since it is a small place and six is a HUGE group in a tiny spot, but it was like they couldn't wait to get rid of us. I think they were actually a little disappointed when we ordered dessert. Try going with a small group on a weekday and try the mufungo."
8901,18,3,1,2/12/2012,"I liked this place overall, but its more of like a lunch spot than a dinner place. ˜The food I had was good and I was told the pulled pork was excellent. ˜The atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired though, a TV is on real loud and there's nothing much on the walls. ˜But if you're looking for a quick bite of some excellent Puerto Rican food this it!"
8902,18,1,1,1/30/2012,"This place has no customer service, I stood in front of the counter trying the catch the eye of the waitresses there and was blantantly ignored..the place wasnt even busy! One waitress was right behind the counter, ˜i smiled said excuse me at her hoping to get her attention she scowled at me and just walked away! i hate throwing the race card out there but I was the only nonhispanic there..it was not hard to infer they have a thing against Asians. ˜I stood there for 10 mins without being acknowleged while other patrons of non Asian descent ˜got serviced. ˜Needless to say this place obviously made me feel extremely unwelcomed. i sont care if food network recommended this place but Casa Adela you can kiss my yellow ass :P."
8903,18,4,1,1/18/2012,"Good Food, but not great. The portions are large, which is good and the food is great. I had the yellow rice with chicken and beans. All was good and I would definitely go back if in the area."
8904,18,5,1,1/9/2012,"If you want some good Puerto Rican food, I would try Casa Adela. The place doesn't look like much - it's really a hole in the wall kind of place. Not much room, so if it's busy you'll be lucky if you find a seat, but the wait would be worth it. Everything in this restaurant is delicious. The roasted chicken is so moist. The maduros are nice and sweet. The tostones are warm and crunchy. The rice, beans, yuca, pork...everything is good. Bring your own beer or wine to wash everything down. The best part of it all is the bill! This place is so affordable. You will eat like a king and pay something like $20. It's true. This place is amazing. Check it out!"
8905,18,3,1,1/6/2012,"Solid cheap Puerto Rican food. ˜Go with the chicken if you can. ˜Mofongo was also quite good, although it needed more stew."
8906,18,5,1,1/2/2012,"This place ruined my recent trip to Puerto Rico...b/c they set too high of a standard. We went to Casa Adela b/c we wanted to try PR food before our trip to PR. ˜We ordered the mofongo and originally wanted to order the rotisserie chicken as well, but they were out. ˜Instead, they suggested fried chicken, which we were wary about b/c it's just hard to do right. The mofongo w/ pernil was amazing. ˜If you don't like garlic, don't get it. ˜If you do, you'll love it. ˜The fried chicken, however, was the real surprise. It was perfectly seasoned and fried in a way where it was still very moist and didn't taste dried out at all. We went to PR a week after this meal, had mofongo 3 times and it came close to this place twice, but even w/ sunshine and 80 degree weather, I was still wishing I had the mofongo at Casa Adela. ˜The one time we tried to get fried chicken, it was nowhere close..."
8907,18,5,1,12/30/2011,"Since there's no good Puerto Rican food in Boston, I save my appetite for my trips to New York. I've been to La Taza de Oro and it's quite alright, but this place was everything I wanted. $4 bought me a pretty big salad with tons of avocado, and for $8.50 I got the best pernil (roast pork shoulder) I've had in a while with some rice and beans. The service was friendly enough, not over-the-top friendly but I could always get one of the old ladies to bring me what I needed. This place is small and casual and they're blasting trashy Univision on the TV and I'm not rushed out the door, so it works well for me! I will be recommending to all my fellow Puerto Rican friends. Oh, and grab a coffee on your way out-- I'm not a big coffee drinker but theirs was just like I remember back home."
8908,18,3,1,12/10/2011,"I must say I was disappointed. The chicken is indeed good, which is clear from reviews. Sadly, I wasn't really in the mood for chicken. I tried the steak w/ onions instead, and it was not good. It didn't look appetizing at all, and the onions tasted funny; the meat itself wasn't terrible, but definitely not great. I ended up eating some of someone else's chicken. The rice and black beans are fine, and the sweet plantains were good."
8909,18,5,1,10/9/2011,"Good authentic, down home Puerto Rican good hiding out in Alphabet City. Service is so friendly to Spanish- and English-speakers alike."
8910,18,5,1,9/13/2011,"!!! BEST COMIDA BORICUA I'VE HAD !!! Well, other than my grandmother's or Titi's (aunt's)! I'm from L.A. and was BLOWN AWAY with how DELICIOUS Adelita's food was...she is a sweet old lady, reminded me of my grandmother too! The prices are great, but I get carried away everytime I go, so I end up spending more than most would. They treated my friends and I like family! (Coo' tip: BYOB...just don't get carried away!)"
8911,18,4,1,9/10/2011,"Straight to it. The Pork Chops here are on a Point! I've learned to avoid Pork Chops at Latin restaurants 'cause nine times out ten it's going to be a bland piece of pig that's been sitting under a heat lamp for 12 hours prior to it hitting your plate. ˜Casa Dela, The total Opposite! Two Banging Ass, Muy Moist Chops of a Flavorful Pig served up with yellow rice and red beans. Tore it up, Tore it Up, Tore it Up. No Fat. Not Charred. Not Dry. Just perfectly cooked pig. I wana give the place five stars but they hit some bumps before the pig made it to the plate. The place is pretty small so we had to wait due to all the tables being full. ˜Another couple walked in right behind us and had to wait as well. So you got four customers patiently waiting to be seated for 15 minutes. After contemplating leaving the place a patron that was sipping coffee and surfing the web walks behind the counter, sticks money in register and then moves his laptop to smaller non-customer table. My company and I just looked at each like these people have to be crazy. ˜No Bueno! Maybe it's just me, but don't waiting, paying customers take precedence in that situation? or any similar situation? Big frown on our faces as we were seated at the table that web surfing staff guy got up from... My friend tried to order the Rotisserie Chicken and Sweet Plantains, which they had none of. So that didn't go over to well with us after the wait. I think that's enough reason to subtract one star, right? ˜So we both ended up with the Pork Chops!! When the food came out we forgot about all of no bueno stuff ˜and the remaining staff was warm and friendly. Enjoyed the meal by far. Will most certainly be back. Fa Sure. if you like a pork chop, bookmark the place."
8912,18,5,1,9/9/2011,"Where has this amazing authentic Puerto Rican food been all my life? Here I am thinking Sofrito was the only place where I can get authentic Puerto Rican food, I was definitely mistaken. This hidden gem was introduced to me by my boyfriend's Uncle and I was utterly surprised at how good it was. Their chicken, I swear it's cooked to perfection, I've never had chicken that tasted sooooo good, I'm not exaggerating, I'm being honest. Go try it, you'll say the same thing, I promise. It's so good that I had to update my ""Favorite Restaurants"" list and I had to knock out Sofrito from being number 1, yahuh, it's that good. Plus the icing on the cake? it's a whole lot cheaper than Sofrito...duhhhh! The service? It's awesome but I guess it's because his Uncle knows the whole staff including the owner, they're all sweethearts, I love it."
8913,18,3,1,7/30/2011,"Starving me and a boyfriend who wants to fill my appetite quickly - we scurried out to Alphabet City to check this place out. ˜ He had once or twice been here but it was my first time so... Service was good but a little disappointed that this place was not as well ventilated as I expected most places to be on a hot summer day. ˜The workers all situate themselves out in the dining area - chattering. ˜It's fine by me as long as my food doesn't take 20 minutes to make. ˜AND it was just a Cubano. ˜AND it barely looked like it had anything in there. ˜SMH. ˜Luck for them I guess, I have a ""small"" stomach. ˜ My boyfriend's food came after mine and it was just a plate of cut out pernil as supposed to stredded, a plate of spanish rice and a cup of red beans. ˜It was good but not as fulfilling as he wanted it to be either and not as he remembered it used to be. Food is cheap and good but not to the point where I'd recommend going if you have an appetite. ˜I'd rather go to La Isla instead. ˜Sadly La Isla on Delancey doesn't stay open after 6pm. ˜SAD FACE."
8914,18,4,1,7/4/2011,"Haven't been here for at least six months, but if it's still like it was then, I'm heading back. Roast chicken and rice and sweet plantains and black beans and awesome."
8915,18,4,1,6/27/2011,"Casa Adela is a hidden jewel in Alphabet City, off of Avenue C, it's likely if your not a local you wouldn't wander over this far. ˜But I would highly recommend taking the trip on over to this wonderful little spot, as the taste and quantity of their food far outpaces that of their low price. I've been here twice now and am returning again. ˜I've had the pernil and roast chicken which was really tasty, the pork is well cooked and the sauce it's cooked in adds great flavor; it mixes well if you top it over your rice and beans (if you take it to go). ˜Also have had the chicken stew, which is just as amazing as the pernil. The wait is long, even for take out, but expect that to be a compliment as they actually cook your food. ˜The wait staff is extremely friendly and patient and are more than willing to strike a conversation with you. ˜ Expect to pay just under $10 a person, without tip. ˜They have a sign posted that says ""Let's just pretend I'm in business to make money"" which is a solid indicator they don't take credit, so bring cash! In my latest experience, we didn't get the correct order for take-out (they forgot to give us our pernil) but we came back the next day and they gave us a complimentary pernil to make up for their mistake... ˜Extremely accommodating and excellent service."
8916,18,5,1,6/22/2011,"amazing authentic, perfectly made. anyone who says anything different doesnt know puerto rican food. super cheap too!"
8917,18,4,1,6/20/2011,Just tried Casa Adela and left with a full tummy and a huge smile. I don't eat meat but had no problem having a terrific feast here. Black Beans Yellow Rice Sweet Plantains Bring your pork loving friends and chow down!
8918,18,5,1,6/19/2011,"- overall rating: 4.5 - recommend: pernil, maduros, white rice with red beans, (rotisserie) pollo - more than reasonable pricing for the portion - authentic and delicious comfort food, never a disappointment - usually a bit of a wait especially if you want a table but that's to be expected with any neighborhood staple, I just take the food to go and venture a block away to 6BC community garden to enjoy my meal - cash only"
8919,18,4,1,6/6/2011,"A mi me encanta La Casa Adela! Tucked away on a quiet street where hipsters have not been spotted, is this unassuming little shop that houses some of the best, authentic Puerto Rican dishes you'll find in Manhattan. This place is unassuming and noticeably homey. From the checkered plastic table linen to Telemundo blasting on a TV, this place offers up comfort and good food at a great price. It was a dark and cold evening and we decided to meet here for a week night dinner. Now, the Puerto Rican (Boriquen) dish to order is pernil asado (roasted pork). Cooked to perfection with flavors slowly steeped into the pork, one can't help but feel paradise with every bite. The meal also came with salad and tostones (fried green plaintain). This dish could easily feed two HUNGRY people. And although it has been awhile since we came here, what sticks out in my mind, is the cheap prices, the high quality pernil, and the wonderful store owner who poured extra-virgin olive oil into our dishes with love and care. There is nothing like a good meal with good company and friendly waitstaff. I will be back to try the guisado (beef stew) and to have some mofongo (mashed plaintain). Le Amo Puerto Rico!"
8920,18,4,1,5/5/2011,the cuban sandwich is awesome and a side of rice and beans will definitely feed more than one person. I like coming here because I always have lunch for the next day too!
8921,18,4,1,4/23/2011,"Delicious. My mom discovered this place off of the food network I think...it was tiny, homey almost. Kind of out of the way, but definitely worth the trek! The staff was really nice as well."
8922,18,4,1,4/20/2011,Absolutely wonderful roast chicken. There's not much else to say.
8923,18,5,1,3/25/2011,"I'm from L.A. and was headed to NY a few weeks ago. I love the Puerto Rican culture and have always been amazed by thier food. Thanks to the previous review of Thomas D, I kidnapped my cousin who lives in Brooklyn and I finally had the opportunity to dine at this Awesome joint! I ordered everything that Thomas D suggested along with some Rotisserie chicken...just one word..WOOOOWWWW!!!! The neighbor is a little sketchy, but the food is soo worth it. Thomas D mentioned that it's BYOB, well you don't have to ask me twice. ˜I showed up with a bottle of Pinot Grigio and we were quickly serviced by Miguel ˜who immediately opened our bottle and served it to us in glasses. Let me tell you; he was awesome. He suggested some other foods and actually suggested another wine called Albarino. I quickly ran accross the street to this wine shop and got us a bottle. The wine was Awesome...I just couldn't believe how amazing the Food, Service, and atmosphere was. I will definately be going back to Casa Adela, every chance I get. Thank you to everyone that gave it great reviews...you yelpers are always on it !!!!"
8924,18,5,1,3/16/2011,"Whole rotisserie chicken $8.50, Yellow rice: $4.50. Well-priced,Delicious, Manhattan-based pollo rico y aros? Priceless....."
8925,18,2,1,3/15/2011,"I'm not quite sure if I went to the same restaurant as all these people raving about Casa Adela. I came here for lunch today and the chicken was just ""meh"" - it doesn't even begin to compare to Pio Pio. I had the mofongo which was a new experience for me, and I wasn't blown away. It was moist, but not terribly flavorful until I doused it in hot sauce. The prices are relatively cheap and you get a big portion, but they tried to charge me .50 more per item than was posted on the menu. I told them about it thinking it was an innocent mistake and the waitress got pretty pissed off, saying they had to raise prices. That's fine, but if you raise prices you have to update your menu. I kind of felt like they were taking advantage of me because of the way I look/dress, although I don't want to believe that's really the case. They finally took the extra charges off. Overall, lunch including a begrudgingly-given tip was $12."
8926,18,5,1,2/28/2011,"Damn Adela, you cook a dirty bird. Rotisserie half-chicken with a large portion of rice and black beans ($8), just like my Puerto Rican mom used to make...If I was Puerto Rican...and if my mom owned a rotisserie oven. Crispy, amazingly seasoned skin perfectly encapsulating all the tender juciness of the animal........I wish I lived in Alphabet City, but it's definitely worth the trek. Cheap, homey, filling, and succulently delicious...My stomach, soul, and wallet all left happy. New York needs more places like this. Good tap water, too. Go with someone who knows the place, they can spot a gringo-newb from a mile away."
8927,18,5,1,2/21/2011,"I wish to say first that I am not Boricua; my wife is, however, and she was VERY impressed by the quality of the food here. ˜Bear in mind they are a CASH ONLY establishment. ˜Bring the dinero for dinner, because cards are not taken. ˜Also, Casa Adela is BYOB, but that's a plus rather than a minus. ˜Always cheaper to buy and bring your own anyway. ˜ Another note: ˜the establishment is rather small. ˜Not many tables (maybe 6 or 7) so get here at a decent hour to avoid the inevitable overcrowding. ˜We went on a Sunday night around 6-ish, and there was plenty of room. ˜ We had the Tostones, Mofongo, Pernil, Bacalao, Chicharrones de Pollo, and Arroz con Habichuelas. ˜All of them were excellent!! ˜Top notch flavors, good portion sizes...not a thing at all to complain about. ˜Seriously: ˜the food tasted GREAT! ˜ Adela's son was present in the restaurant while we were there. ˜He told us Adela had recently been on the Food Network because Aaron Sanchez had said her Pernil was the best he'd had in NY! ˜Turns out Adela was in PR at the time, but the food was in very capable hands. ˜ Service was quick, friendly, and it helped having a wife order in the native tongue! ˜ We will most certainly be back when we can find the time. ˜We drove 2 hrs. to eat here and stop at Ferrara's in Little Italy before returning home and we were NOT disappointed. ˜ If you are into Puerto Rican food, get here pronto and chow down because the joint gets 5 stars from us!"
8928,18,4,1,2/18/2011,I'm not Borricua(n) but this place is in my neighborhood. The food and service are very good. Adele herself is just wonderful too. But recently I noticed that their phone # 212.473.1882 is (also) a fax #? Great place! I'd give it 5 stars but I don't believe in perfect just near perfection. BTW their beans is to die for!
8929,18,4,1,1/13/2011,"Thank you Yelp!! Tried it tonight and it was everything I thought it would be and I had high hopes. ˜I am the type who likes local flavor and the real deal type thing and since I live 3 blocks away I had to try it. ˜I believe it will definitely become part of my rotation. ˜ I give it 4 stars because it's not a place that's got a lot of atmosphere, but I personally enjoy the telemundo soap opra playing in the background and the local street folk coming by to pick up recycling. ˜But I have to warn for others who may not enjoy that. Our server could not be nicer and all the food was terrific. ˜The chicken was not to be missed and the hot sauce with it ... yum! ˜Steak and onions were good too!"
8930,18,4,1,1/9/2011,"There really aren't that many authentic Puerto Rican restaurants in NYC. ˜This is one of them. ˜What often passes as a Puerto Rican restaurant is really Dominican, which, by the way, is very similar and very good. ˜Adela's place is fantastic and really feels like eating in her kitchen. ˜If there is a criticism, and this is minor, it's that some menu items are frequently not available. ˜The staff do, however, always remind me to call in advance if you want something specific. ˜I guess this is probably a good sign in that they don't pre-prepare everything and just re-heat. ˜Everything is made from scratch and most of all, made extremely well."
7115,18,4,1,1/5/2011,"This is an awesome Puerto Rican restaurant in Alphabet City around 5th Street. This appears to be a neighborhood favorite. There's lots of people hanging around inside watching TV, making conversation, and drinking coffee. Alot of the people who came in whenever I was there knew the workers there and vice versa. The staff here is very friendly. The place is a bit small (there are about 6 tables), so it can get crowded. The food here is just like home cooking. The roast chicken here is very good. I have also had the chuletas fritas here (fried pork chops) and those were amazingly juicy and tender as well. You can order entrees here with rice and beans, or with salad and plantains. Prices here are also good, with the entrees around $7-$9. Come here and you will not be disappointed."
8931,18,4,1,12/24/2010,"Living in the neighborhood, I find myself here just about weekly, either for a quaint BYOB sitdown, or for takeout. Food is very very good. ˜Hallmark is their rotisserie chicken, which they make round the clock- extremely succulent and flavorful. Their rice and beans are one of the best in the city - really, they are. Chicharones and stews are also delicious. Matron Adela is usually puttering around the kitchen. ˜Say hola! Forgivable negatives - small cramped bathroom hidden by the kitchen. ˜And they took down the old photos of the Loisaida neighborhood and people, which had given it a cool authentic touch of nostalgia."
8932,18,4,1,11/15/2010,"This is alphabet city at its Puerto Rican best. I can imagine this is what good PR home cooking is like. Chicken off the rotisserie is delicious. Stews are rich and flavorful. Flan is amazing (almost like a cheese cake). Plus, the staff is super nice."
8933,18,5,1,11/1/2010,"A fantastic Puerto Rican restaurant that's cheap, quick (they do delivery), and BYOB. I've eaten here twice - once ordering the 1/2 roasted chicken and the other time ordering the chicken stew. Both times I also got the mofongo and black beans with yellow rice. Not only was everything incredibly delicious - but I had enough food for 2 additional meals. My friend ordered the cuban sandwich and was extremely satisfied. Furthermore, the staff was extremely friendly and accommodating- happily answering all of my questions (I have food allergies). If you're going for dinner, don't wait too long, as they sometimes run out of roast chicken."
8934,18,4,1,10/19/2010,"What an amazing puerto rican restaurant! being from puerto rico myself, I miss the food terribly. But every time I come here I leave as satisfied as if I ate at my grandma's kitchen. And the best part of all, is that its super affordable, and BYOB!"
8935,18,4,1,8/25/2010,Totally solid.....it's pretty amazing what you can get for under $10 here! ˜So cheap and the 1/2 pollo is really good! I'll definitely be visiting this place again. On a side note: its BYOB if you dine in
8936,18,4,1,8/21/2010,"This place is totally awesome. I love that it's away from the crowds but still only a 5 minutes walk from my apt. The place is pretty small and feels like someone's kitchen. There's always random people sitting around, hanging out, watching tv and sipping cafe con leche. Sometimes they have their shoes off. Sometimes their grandkids are doing homework next to them. Had chicken stew with beans and rice and chicharrons with rice and beans. ˜Both faboo. Total home cooking stylez. Our waiter, who seemed to also be perhaps the owner or manager, was so hospitable and kind and on top of making sure we were set with everything we needed. He was helpful without being annoying. I kind of want him to be my friend or a babysitter for my future children. I have designated this place to become my no fuss go-to spot for meat beans and rice!"
8937,18,4,1,8/17/2010,"I could just eat the beans and rice and be happy. Throw in a savory and well seasoned roast chicken with fall off the bone meat, pollo chicharones or fried chicken, mofongo, and melt in your mouth roast pork and not only am I happy but I am in need of a serious nap. The atmosphere is like eating at your aunties house if they were straight from the PR. What a find, and for all the food we only paid $40!"
5722,18,3,1,8/5/2010,"chicken chicharrons, beef stew, yellow rice, maduros. ˜ oh, and BYOB. ˜done and done."
8938,18,4,1,7/15/2010,"We went here on a recommendation from a friend and it was perfect. The service was friendly, the price just right. We order the roast chicken, pernil asado and side of yellow rice and pinto beans. Everything was done brilliantly. While the decor is more of I came to your grandmother's kitchen for dinner and nothing special but don't let that stop you from coming in. You'll want to come back for more."
8939,18,4,1,7/10/2010,"Sweet Jesus I love this place. Its a bit of a trek to get to, but totally worth it. I grab a 12 rack of beers at the market down the block (BOYB), post up at one of the 6 tables in the joint, and order a rotisserie chicken, rice, beans, and mofongo. Their self-proclaimed ""best rotisserie chicken in Manhattan"" may in fact be the best in Manhattan, and the authenticity of the rest of the menu, as well as the interior of the place, is undeniable. The beauty is in the bill, which will barely break $10."
8940,18,5,1,6/23/2010,"Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm, que rico! This hole-in-the-wall of a restaurant has great character, friendly service and delicious food. For a little over $9, I enjoyed a huge portion of rice and beans, along with half of a delicious roasted chicken. This is the kind of place where you not only enjoy the food, but you also feel like your money spent is going to a great and deserving group of people."
8941,18,5,1,6/12/2010,"This place oozes soul and flavor. It's family-run and you can feel the history of the place. Photos through the years this place has been around line the walls. The staff is absolutely wonderful-always attentive, very sweet, and quick to get anything you may need. Also, it's generations of the family....often as many as 3 generations serving. The food here is delicious. The sancocho is out of this world-especially on a chilly day. Warms you right up. The platanos (maduros) are some of the best I've had in the city. Cooked to perfection, and not too oily. I would come here daily for the maduros if I could.The pernil is to die for-perfect balance of meaty unhealthy fatness. Rice and beans are like you would get in abuela's kitchen. The chuletas cause a serious mouth-gasm. The cafe is delightfully strong but delicious. I wish all coffee in NYC was as good. Only negative is it's cash only-but, being that the portions are HUGE and cheap, one can't really complain. Definitely one of my favorite NYC spots!"
8942,18,5,1,3/28/2010,"Adela's WOW. I friend recommended my to come for some home cooked Puerto Rican food. No frills needed just quality delicious home cooked food at a affordable price. I went on a Sunday night around 8. Adela was there with probibly 5 of her family members, three or four generations. All cooking, laughing and smiling. There is a strong sense of love and history in this place. The half the chicken, plantains and cuban sandwich were all delicious. I will prob. go back this week"
8943,18,4,1,2/8/2010,"WEPA! ˜Homemade Puerto Rican food como mi mami. ˜Authentic. ˜Cheap. ˜Delicious. ˜Forget ambiance or detailed service. ˜You're here for the food and the flan. ˜Everything on the menu is always spot on so just order whatever you're in the mood for. ˜Terrific, tiny spot."
8944,18,5,1,1/24/2010,"My husband Loves Adelas coffee ! ˜Beautiful pictures, You can feel the history of the place . very nice staff, the food smell great ! Cheap"
8945,18,5,1,1/19/2010,"LOVE the Cuban sandwich with it's fresh pork that's prepared daily, smothered in melting cheesy goodness and finished with plentiful ham. And there's pickles and mustard and it's $4 cheaper than Porchetta...competition is good for the market right!"
8946,18,5,1,1/18/2010,All I can say is that it really feels like home to me. Reminds me of my summers in the Carribean. The coffee is absolutley great. The pictures on the wall are also captivating and tell a rich story about LES.
8947,18,5,1,1/5/2010,Wonderful neighborhood joint. It's a small place with half a dozen tables. And some of them may be occupied by their friends or family. Went to eat pernil on a cold night but it was sold out. I was contemplating if I should tackle the couple infront of me who took the last order of the day. Pork chop was juicy and tender roast chicken just fell off the bone! And the owner was very very pleasant. Photos in the wall are also interesting. You can feel the history of the place.
8948,18,3,1,12/13/2009,"There are fewer places in my neighborhood that I enjoy eating at more than Casa Adela. It's open for lunch, has a laid back attitude & consistently serves up excellent Puerto Rican food. Entering the place there are 3 things that you will immediately notice; Delicious chicken dancing in a rotisserie, Latino TV on a small set in the back & owner Adela Fargas with her army of family members & employees working away endlessly among the diners. I normally order the half a chicken with yellow rice & black beans, but as of late I've been trying other dishes. I recently had the bacalou (dried cod cooked with veggies in a tomato sauce), the roast pork & the chicken stew. All good dishes, but the chicken is still my favorite. It has a deep red, flavorful skin (I'd really like to know how they spice this dish) & succulent, moist flesh. I've tried to replicate it at home & just cannot get anywhere as close. With the weather being this cold, you might also want to try out the Sacocho, an awesome soup with loads of root vegetables & a chunk of oxtail. ˜Guaranteed to warm you up! The cafe con leche there is also really good, as well as the flan which is made using cream cheese & has a very unique flavor. The average meal will run you about 10 bucks or so, but trust me when I say that you'll leave more than satisfied!"
8949,18,3,1,11/9/2009,"I love plantains. ˜It made me so happy that every entree came with a choice of rice and beans or salad and plantains. ˜(And it was a generous helping of plantains as well!) The boyfriend had pork with the rice and beans, and I had beef stew (because they were out of the chicken stew) with salad and plantains. ˜Overall, a cheap & tasty meal. Oh, also, it looked like it was BYOB, although we didn't have anything with us."
8950,18,5,1,9/10/2009,"The mofongo here was perfection. ˜I've paid three times more and had half the enjoyment at white tablecloth places. ˜The alcapurrias were first rate. ˜Freshly made, not pulled out from under a lght bulb. ˜The bistec encebollado (steak with onions) was just right. ˜Tasty and tender. ˜Two guys had the bacalao a la viscaina (shreded cod fish stew with potatoes) and were very happy. ˜The pernil was taaaaaasty. ˜This compared to anything that you can get back on the island. ˜It is basic and good. ˜If you want fancy food in a sparkling modern setting you will be disappointed. ˜If you think that mofongo needs lime to brighten the flavors you won't like it so much. ˜Folks, this is how the food should be. ˜A great traditional menu and flavors. ˜ The place is very tiny and a bit run down. ˜The service isn't performed by tuxedo clad waiters. ˜It is home. ˜With homestyle food. The Food Channel was there filming a segment of ""the Best Thing That I Ever Ate"" or whatever that show is called. ˜ They know a thing or two, those folks..."
8951,18,3,1,8/5/2009,"Back in the days of my 5th floor walkup on between C&D, aka ""the hungry yrs,"" this was a spot I'd come to on my way home for work. I think I only ate here once, but would typically get a 1/2 chicken and some rice and beans and take it home. I don't remember the exact price, but it was something like $7, that would end up being 2 meals. They hook it up. I was typically the only gringo in there, but was always met with warm smiles and pleasantries. I had a Cuban sammy once and it was good but to me nothing beats the one at Cortadito, which is only one avenue from here, so I stick with that. This is a great bang-for-your-buck spot if you live in the hood, but don't travel far and wide to come."
8952,18,3,1,6/16/2009,"pretty cool place, easy-going, friendly, yummy basic puerto rican food. i recommend going at least once. it's a byob, so you can take your own alcohol."
8953,18,4,1,4/28/2009,"In the time before gentrification this eatery must have been a sight to see, bustling with local personalities and a sabor uniquely Puerto Rican. It still gets a crowd and might be a wonderful symbol for the old meeting the new. You'll spot old school locals boisterously familiar with the staff, but you won't be hard pressed to find adventurous newbies taking in the sounds, smells, sights of an old fashioned eatery - a place where it seems like the waitstaff is involved in the preparation of your food. ˜ While very charming, this little eatery is not for the fickle. We waited a while, a long while to get attention from the waitstaff. But it is a tiny neighborhood staple, with its own nuances and we weren't prepared for it. Once it became apparent that the we weren't being served - the staff took extra care to be attentive to us. The food was good. We ate the mofongo - a mashed plantain/pork/garlic staple of the Caribbean. The garlic in the mofongo was very potent. I find mofongo can sometimes be a bit to dry, that was not the case here. The san cocho here was also nice, as good as a restaurants interpretation of the hearty stew can get. The rotisserie chicken was delicious, well seasoned and slow cooked to fatty perfection. The tostones were nice but a bit softer than I prefer. The batida (a shake of sorts) was creamy, fruity, and cinammony. ˜ Had some nice conversations with the staff. Smiles all around."
8954,18,5,1,4/19/2009,"Stumbled upon this place when my friends and I were killing time before heading into next-door Nublu. ˜Their chicken is AMAZING. ˜The attitude is very laid-back, it's as if you're eating in the living room of extended family ˜(minus the awkwardness). ˜I've taken visiting friends to this place, and they still talk about the food long after they've left the city."
8955,18,5,1,3/27/2009,"i'm Puerto Rican and this place reminded me of when i would be dragged by my parents to a relative whom i've never met's house, left to sit on the plastic-covered couch watching fuzzy tv, deathly afraid to change the channel, only to have that interrupted by my mother yelling ""Gaby, quieres comer""...the portions aren't insanely big but the taste makes up for it, the pernil and mofongo are among the best i've had and so is the roast chicken, it can be hit or miss but so was my mother's cooking so i don't hold it against the chef, this is after all a mother's kitchen just open to the public"
8956,18,5,1,3/19/2009,"One of my favorite places in the entire city. Insanely huge portions for the money and the half-a-chicken is perfection itself. The wine is good, the water is freezing cold and the tostones are my favorite appetizer. There's a huge fridge of Goya juices (just like you used to drink as a kid!) and sodas. Everything is delicious because it's homemade. Highly recommended."
8957,18,4,1,12/16/2008,I came here to use the bathroom. This place has a lot of heart though. There seemed to be a whole puerto rican family here. I got some sort of strange chicken dish. It was good except for the red beans. I was served food by like a ninety year old grandmother. Got to love it. I felt like part of the family. Note: There were a bunch of copies of the financial times here for the customers. This was pretty heavy reading lol.
8958,18,4,1,10/6/2007,"Casa Adela has great, authentic, inexpensive Puerto Rican food. After a show at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe, I took my friend who is originally from Puerto Rico (she's a finicky former model and is generally found at Ciprani in 4 inch heels making the scene). She absolutely loved it - both the food and the atmosphere. Try the beef stew. It is the ultimate comfort food. The beef is cooked to perfection. I live a few blocks away and I stop by (to eat in or take out) semi-regularly in the winter. The restaurant pulls locals from the neighborhood and just like my neighbors who have lived in the hood forever, they ain't gonna cater to you. And unless they know you, they are not going to be overly friendly...they warm up over time. During the blackout, the owners took action and served up huge plates for 5 bucks a pop. Everyone instantly bonded over the homemade food. Great experience."
8959,18,2,1,8/31/2007,"Neighborhood charm my ass. A small rundown spot with greasy tables and blaring Spanish language TV from the corner. The waitress seemed overwhelmed and unqualified. I love Latino cooking, but the food here is weak. I had the pork chops. Two over cooked under spiced slabs with a side of rice and beans. The rice and beans were really tasteless. In a city that is so rich in Latino cooking Casa Adela is a waste of time."
8960,18,4,1,8/2/2007,"Just moved to the area. ˜Super excited. ˜Decided to step into Casa Adela to have my first meal in my new neighborhood. ˜Had the half chicken with rice & beans, avocado salad, and a batida de papaya. ˜Chicken was super juicy and flavorful. ˜Black beans were soooooo yummy, cooked perfectly. ˜She used the West Indian type of avocado for the salad - I kind of prefer the creamier avocados, but it was still good. ˜The batida was so-so... ˜it was too ice-creamy for me. ˜Overall, it was a good meal - I cleaned my plate! ˜Will definitely be back to try her other stuff!"
8961,18,3,1,5/13/2006,"This slightly run-down Puerto Rican luncheonette draw in more Puerto Rican locals than East Village hipsters, which can be a refreshing change. On a slow weeknight, you might be the only actually paying customer. A grandmother is sitting in the next table shelling beans and watching telenovelas, a group of old men are flirting with the waitress, someone comes in to pick up her kids who are coloring at the front table. The food is fantastic and the bill will make you wonder if you're in Puerto Rico, not Manhattan. Generous portions means that an order of their fabulous roasted chicken or pork, with rice and beans, and fried plantains is enough to feed two. A word of warning: If you don't finish your plate, or if you don't know your way around PR food, there's a chance you'll get the evil eye from the waitress. Being the recipient of the evil eye enough times where they actually recognize me now, I can tell you that it's definitely not a good thing. At this point, I'm actually kind of scared to go back (thus the three stars). If you go, I hope you either have a ˜larger appetite or a steelier nerves."
8962,18,3,1,3/22/2006,"Casa Adela was started by Adela (who still around) back in the early 70s. According to family members, they've seen a lot of change in the neighborhood but they're happy that things have been cleaned up a bit. Adela turns out a crave-worthy cubano sandwich (~$6.75). A stellar and voluminous combination of supple roast pork, ham, swiss, and pickles on a warm and toasty roll. This is a near perfect sandwich. The mofongo (~$5.50) combines mashed plantains, shredded pork, and garlic. While I liked the dish, it needed salt and maybe a squeeze of lime to brighten the flavors. I also tried the pernil asado, or roasted pork, which included a side of rice and beans. I opted for yellow rice and black beans, all three items came on separate plates with a brothy sauce on the side. I mixed everything together, added a few squirts of the table squeezy bottle of hot sauce, and a bit of mofongo. Although the pork was not tough, it was not quite as fatty and luscious as the roast pork on the sandwich. Eating at Adela's felt like I was eating at the Puerto Rican grandmother's house that I never had. Telenovelas on the tv, occasional bursts of song, loud conversation, and sass amongst the ladies running the place, and fellows from the neighborhood dropping in for this and that. The rotisserie chicken looked good too. 3.5 stars overall, but I would give the sandwich 4.5 on its own."
8963,19,1,0,6/30/2013,"My girlfriend and I stopped in here for brunch today, Sunday June 30th and we were VERY dissatisfied. We placed our order and noticed some disorganization among the staff but didn't realize what it would cost us... 1. we waited 25 minutes before we got our food, we ordered a bacon/chicken sandwich and a tuna wrap ... not all that difficult 2. the bacon/chicken sandwich should've been deluxe as we ordered it that way and we never actually got the extras that came with it 3. we ordered a wrap that had sundried tomatoes in it and it was so greasy the entire wrap ended up drenched in it and so did my hands, gross! 4. we told the owner about our experience and he gave us some strange explanation about how he thought our order was a ""phone order"" and that's why we waited so long ... yet the staff were speaking with customers who appeared to be their friends asking what they liked and never once addressed us 5. I unfortunately noticed some FOOD SAFETY ISSUES: the man cooking our food was also EATING FOOD at the same time, other workers were eating food while behind the counter, I saw a worker wipe his sweat with a rag that ended up on his shoulder ...and god knows where else Unfortunately I did try to nicely explain these things to the owner but he really did not understand, and I'm not sure they follow proper protocol with their food safety. I'd avoid this place and continue giving honest reviews until they fix the problems or close."
8964,19,1,0,6/1/2013,"This place is close to where I work so I go there. The bagels are really not good, but the staff did make me jalepeno cream cheese on the spot. ˜And I just don't understand how you serve someone iced coffee by just pouring hot coffee over a little ice? That is not iced coffee. And then they were ""out of more ice."" How do you run out of ice?? Nice enough folks but the bagels just don't cut it. I hope they stay in business though."
8965,19,5,0,8/17/2012,"So surprised royal got such bad reviews!!! Guess the good ones never made it... I for one LOVE the bagels!! You can tell they are fresh when you eat them. The multigrain is nice and soft which is great since most places get them a little too hard. The different cream cheese flavors are my favorite part. They're delicious!! My personal favorite? Strawberry cream cheese. Not too sweet so it's perfect. I've also had their sandwiches for lunch and they're fantastic as well. The best one is probably the royal chicken sandwich ˜it has chicken, melted motz, sundries tomatos, roasted red peppers, and balsamic. I've honestly had a handful of their sandwiches and they're all great so there's no going wrong with this place. Oh and don't forget the fries!!! They're perfectly fried... Crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I'm never disappointed when I come here. They're fast so it's perfect when you're on the run. If you have time, the new owners are very friendly and would love to chat. Oh and if you're worried about the cleanliness of the place, it's been very appealing since they got there. They have also added on iced coffee, iced tea, fresh fruit, and bubble tea to the menu so try those too."
8966,19,2,1,7/27/2014,"Wife and I stopped here for bagels today. ˜Although they looked like bagels, they tasted like plastic. Arguably a small step above frozen bagels found in a grocery store, but these are among the worst bagels I've ever had. We did not try anything else so this review is limited to their bagel offerings. Come to think of it I have actually had worse bagels, but these were nevertheless terrible."
8967,19,5,1,6/13/2014,"I think other reviewers have been too harsh to judge. this place makes some of the best wraps I've known. in fact, I grab a BLT avocado wrap every time I stop by. if you get to know the owners well enough, you'll find them very kind and accommodating. yes the wait for the sandwich is quite long but that doesn't deter me from rewarding them 5 stars. rating them with 2 is a tad bad extreme and unnecessary."
8968,19,2,1,4/16/2014,"When I want to go on a walk but don't feel like walking all the way to my favorite, Hot Bagels Abroad, I come here. I find that they are sometimes out of bagels and I don't really find anything special about this place. The staff is okay but I think that they take a little longer to make hot food. The location is good if you are walking on the Avenue or if you need to catch a bus but unfortunately, my heart will remain with Hot Bagels."
8969,19,4,1,10/14/2013,"Got a Charlie Wrap the other morning. ˜Plenty of taylor ham, eggs, and garlicky home fries. ˜I had them add hot sauce, and I loved every bite. ˜Home fries could have been a bit crispier, as they lacked any real crust, and I had to wait a little longer than I would have expected. ˜However, for $5, it was well worth it!"
8970,19,1,1,7/3/2013,"This place is dangerous and the board of health needs to do an inspection. I watched as the man making my food wore the same plastic glove to touch RAW MEAT, cheese, eggs, bagels, cream cheese, and garbage. This is cross contamination and will easily get someone very sick. You absolutely cannot handle raw meat and then anything else without changing gloves. It is the law and common sense. Also the garbage is directly next to the grill...he held the raw meat just inches over the garbage while waiting for the other worker to move something. He even wiped the dirty glove on his clothes and kept handling more customers food! When he came to the counter with the food, I told him what I just watched him do and asked if he thought I should still eat it. He was insulted as if I had done something wrong and was upset because he thought he had to make it again. I said I didn't want any other food and left. This took 25 minutes as well... ...and seriously, touching raw meat and then everyone's bagels and other stuff is completely disgusting and dangerous"
8971,19,3,1,4/5/2013,"Stop here in the morning on my way home from work. ˜The bagels are fresh and big. ˜Not a fan of the coffee though. ˜Have had wraps here as well, very good."
8972,19,1,1,11/17/2012,Don't go. ˜Period. ˜ There are faaaar better bagels up the street on Valley Rd and this place just sucks. ˜I have gone 3 times because I live close and get lazy. ˜EVERY TIME I saw mouse crap on the floor. ˜ One time I actually saw a mouse run across the floor behind the guy serving me.
8973,19,1,1,7/29/2012,"Been in there a couple of times. Orders always wrong. Quality is very poor. They always try to cheat me out of money and pretend they don't understand when I correct them. The deli case looks disgusting with all of those mayonnaise-based salads glazing over from age. If you happen to be wallpapering your house, order the salads to use as glue. Big space inside to sit, but doesn't offset the problems. Pros: 1) Its cheap 2) A side order of food poisoning is free with all orders. Epic fail..."
8974,19,1,1,7/8/2012,"I haven't tried the bagels, but my girlfriend went and picked us up breakfast one day including a ""Bacon Egg & Cheese Omelet"" and a ""Bacon Egg & Cheese Sandwich on a Hard Roll with Salt Pepper and Ketchup."" There was no salt, pepper, or ketchup on the sandwich, the omelet was fluff-free scrambled eggs with bacon thrown in the middle and they may have used MAYBE half a slice of thinly sliced American cheese total between the two items. I will never go back to this place. If you're not going to do things right, leave them off your menu. There is no excuse for the quality of food we received. None. I could make better food when I was ten than these people made as a matter of business."
8975,19,1,1,10/4/2011,"I don't like it when I do not get what I order, I ordered a taylor ham, egg and cheese and three times he asked me if i wanted ketchup and three times i had to say no, but he forgets to put on the cheese and charges me for it anyway. ˜I could see if someone else made the sandwich but he took my order, made the sandwich and took my money so it was deliberate."
8976,1662,1,0,12/13/2014,"There are several high-end steak houses within a few blocks of this establishment, I suggest you go to any one of them before you go here. ˜ First off, the overwhelming smell of sun-baked fish assaults your olfactory nerves as soon as you walk in the door, so you immediately know this is more surf than it is turf. ˜What some reviewers have called modern, chic, ˜and new age, I just call VERY LOUD; it's like eating in an auditorium. ˜It's one large, open-air room with two-story high ceilings, and absolutely no sound deflecting partitions. ˜This makes for a very noisy atmosphere. ˜Also, when 25% of the floor space is THE BAR you are going to get the bar-like joviality which is loud on a Friday night. The staff are very friendly and attentive, which is to be expected given the restaurant's high-end persona. ˜You would think with all that pampering they would pay attention to the special requests, but you would be wrong. ˜Simple requests like extra butter or a sliver of onion fall upon multiple deft ears. ˜On top of that, the service is just plain sloooow; particularly coming out of the bar. ˜Case in point: drinks were ordered and then about ten minutes later the appetizers were ordered; the appetizers were actually delivered and consumed before the drinks ever made it to the table. Apparently, The Bar is the place to be for wildly exotic drinks, and that might be why it takes so long to actually get a drink. ˜However, it does not explain why a very basic drink that contains just three simple ingredients proved to be difficult to get right. ˜In fairness to them, my wife LOVED her fresh raspberry martini - once is arrived. On to the meal. ˜The steaks were ""average"" at best. ˜No, they were more toward the low end of the average scale, like at an Outback or Longhorn. ˜Perhaps mediocre is the right term. ˜The baked potatoes had the look and consistency of ˜potatoes that had been baked several hours in advance of this meal, and they were delivered lukewarm; their temperature was such that the butter placed on top wouldn't even melt. ˜I'm guessing had we not opted to order them sans ""loaded"" some of these deficiencies might not have been so evident. ˜ When the problem of the potatoes was brought to the attention of management, they were very quick to apologize, quick to offer replacement potatoes, but NOT so quick to actually deliver said replacement potatoes. ˜Quite frankly, when 4/5 of our steaks had already been consumed I finally told them to just forget bringing us new potatoes. The waiter had raved about the chocolate cake made in-house, so that's what we ordered. ˜Big mistake! ˜It had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. ˜It looked like it came from the frozen food section of the market, and it tasted about the same. Aside from the fabulous martini my wife had, the only other positive is that management did comp about ""half"" the check. ˜That gesture certainly softened the blow, but the overall horrible experience will not allow me to ever return to this restaurant."
8977,1662,1,0,2/10/2014,"had reservations @ 5 on Sunday which is a good time on wknd. Everything started out good but the waiter ˜was quite annoying.The presentation wasn't too bad however after each food plate was delivered the waiter would come over and ask how the plate was? Well,give us time to get one piece in our mouth first! For some reason he felt our conversation would,nt survive without his little comments and questions. Personally, I like to dine and converse with family and friends without constantly being interrupted. I was enjoying the last morsel on my salad plate as the waiter stood Right next to me waiting for me to hurry so he could grab my plate.Anoying! We were finally finishing up our deserts and ,once again, he procedes to stand there and ask how is it. Mouth full, I just looked @him and he just stood there as though we were enjoying his annoying tactics. All said and done, wasn't that great of an Expensive meal! I understand service with a smile, but Really,there is that fine line of Good Service and simply being in our face! wont be back!"
8978,1662,1,0,10/25/2013,Shitty experience with the food. Server Chris was great though. Benn to much better established places in Philly.
8979,1662,1,0,10/13/2013,"Decor is glitzy. Sales pitch delivered by the waitress oversold, and the food underdelivered. ˜Except for the steaks, everything was extremely SALTY. ˜On a Sunday night at 9:30PM, the delay in clearing the appetizer plates was dissapointing, and the long wait for our entrees was annoying."
8980,1662,1,0,9/30/2013,"We went expecting an excellent evening, partly due to the reviews we read, boy were we wrong. We have dined at some of the best steakhouses in the country, OP was not one of them. ˜My wife had a martini, good, I had a Manhattan, not so. Her drink filled the glass mine was about 3/4 and tasted more of water than Makers Mark. ˜Apps were average shrimp cocktail was a bit limp. We ordered a Kansas City Strip and a filet mignon, neither would have had any taste if it wasn't for the liver taste of the filet. The creamed spinach with smoked bacon only tasted of the smoked bacon. The roasted garlic head used for garnish would have been excellent if it didn't just come out of the fridge and served ice cold. Now for the service, the staff was friendly. ˜With just my wife and I at the table I was served the cocktails and food first, at all times with the item my wife had ordered. ˜The wrong bottle of wine was brought to the table, see it is important to read the label. We saw a lot of staff from other restaurants we go to in the city working there, thought we would have had a great night, unfortunately that did not happen."

Excellent crisp skin Other sides are ordinary steakhouse sides Dessert Key lime tort is awful. Gooey artificial tasting filling Baled Alaska is a classic dessert WIGB? No. Too many exciting dinning options in Philly to go to this typical steak house which was formally Roy's."
8982,1662,3,0,5/11/2014,"Came here recently for Sunday dinner. Tuna tartare and mussels were great. However, the salmon entree was good, though the sticky rice and the sauce with it was too much/didn't mesh well. Lobster tails for ($49) was really disappointing. I think I've had better lobster at other places for sure. Service was really good, although the food did take a bit longer than usual getting out. All in all, this restaurant is ""ok"". I really don't know what the hype is about. If I ever come here again, I'll probably just stop by the bar instead."
8983,1662,3,0,3/23/2014,I think this place is a little overrated ! first and foremost they would not let me in without pulling my shirt down while there was only an inch of my midriff skin out . meanwhile there were girls walking around with hooker short dresses on and guys with hoodies they would wear on the street corner ! service was really good besides that . our waiter was Chris and he was beyond friendly and helpful ! overall nothing to really brag about . much rather enjoy a meal at capital grille !
8984,1662,3,0,1/30/2014,It's not all its hyped up to be. The food was pretty good and flavorful. The drinks were really good. They were running behind on reservations so it was a 15 min wait. The waiter was really nice and helpful but the food service was horrible. We waited an hr to get just our appetizers and another 20 for them to bring out our entrees. And 15min for dessert. I never had to wait that long for food. Very pissed. 3 stars only because the food and drinks are good .
8985,1662,3,0,9/29/2013,"My friend and I were so excited about the happy hour menu that we were dying to go. The happy hour hours were posted online but did not include the days. Many restaurants in the city have weekend happy hours so we called to confirm the days. The person who answered the phone, the hostess I presume, confirmed that the happy hour menu was available on Saturday. When we arrived at the bar, there was no happy hour. We told the bar tender what was told to us over the phone earlier and she said that person was wrong. Ok fine, people make mistakes. We ordered some wine and when the bill came, we were overcharged. I politely confronted the bar tender and she said that the bill was correct, even though I tripled checked the menu and she definitely overcharged us. I am not impressed with the service but will give it another chance because I really want to try the food. The decor was beautiful and the menu looks good. Service could definitely use some work."
8986,1662,3,0,9/13/2013,Food was good. Was expecting better. ˜Ambiance and d?cor was top notch.
8987,1662,5,0,9/30/2014,Great food great service right in the middle of center city! Definitely recommend to anyone visiting or locals to eat
8988,1662,5,0,5/10/2014,service wonderfull.. remembered us after just one visit. higly recomend
8989,1662,5,0,4/30/2014,"We went here for my birthday, no expectations. Gorgeous decor and great ambiance as soon as we walked in. Service right away is there to help you with any questions. Wine list is long and full of great selections. We ordered the scallop and beef short rib appetizer, which is awesome! We then split the romaine salad with walnuts, also great!! We both had steaks and then paired them with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli! Our meal was phenominal and so was our service. Our server was Irish Mike, who was professional and prompt with everything we needed. This is now my favorite restaurant in the city, a must for anyone! Prices are high but worth every penny if you're looking for the best! Enjoy this place if you decide to branch out! We did!"
8990,1662,5,0,3/14/2014,"Excellent service. Their knowledge of wine pairings for my combination of steak and seafood was impeccable. My steak wasn't done to my liking, and my waiter immediately took it away after seeing the look of disdain a few times. I did not have to ask, they simply came, asked for permission to take it away, and came back with something at just the right temperature/rareness. Price is a bit on the steep side, but then again you get what you paid for. Very relaxed environment, great place to go after a tough day's work, start with a bit of scotch and then work your way through their menu, take your time. Don't eat too much of your main course, their dessert is also highly recommended."
8991,1662,5,0,1/19/2014,"Had a lovely dinner tonight as a first pick during Philly Restaurant Week. The service was perfect. There were managers visible and active circulating around the dining area. Twice during our visit they stopped at our table to welcome us and to ask about our meal and dining experience. There was a brief wait for our reserved time. We were directed to the bare to wait where we were greeted with seasoned popcorn and offers of drinks. I had their signature bubbling berries martini. It was a real treat! The Food Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered the Filet and Salmon. The temperature of my medium steak was perfect, at the recommendation of our server I changed my choice from medium-rare to medium. He explained in detail the process they use to determine their steak temperatures followed by a promise to replace his suggestion with my first choice if it was not right for me. My dining partners salmon looked so good that I wanted to put my fork in his plate for a taste. The lobster bisque was creamy with large chunks of lobster. We both had carrot cake which was a little too sweet for my taste but was delicious. There were tiny layers of cake with cream cheese icing between each layer . I would eat here every week if I could ! It would be a great place for a Valentine's Day dinner. (hint, hint) One big TIP involves the parking. I would recommend using the Valet service offered right in front of the restaurant for $18.00 . (Sunday evening price ) We parked in the closest lot we saw to the tune of $29.00 for just under 2 hours of parking time."
8992,1662,5,0,12/21/2013,"We were a little hesitant about keeping this reservation after the recent LeBan review. ˜Our Christmas Friends Dinner is usually at one of the Center City steakhouses; we were very glad we kept this reservation. ˜From start to finish this was a delightful and delicious experience. As we were a group of six, we tried a variety of appetizers, (definitely try the crab cake, wedge salad and the shrimp appetizer). ˜Those who ordered the filet mignon said it was like ""butter melting in your mouth; my ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and tender and the Chilean sea bass was also a fabulous dish. ˜Our great dining experience was made even more pleasant by our server Crystal. ˜She was ˜delightful, a great conversationalist, expertly answered all our questions and made great suggestions! ˜We will definitely be returning to Ocean Prime!"
8993,1662,5,0,10/17/2013,"My husband and I came here for some appetizers to munch on and enjoyed a few cocktails. At first I was a little stubborn because I am comfortable with what I am used to and what I like. I wasn't quite in the mood to ""try something new."" When we first walked in, I was amazed at how beautiful the space was. The decor and ambiance will blow you away. The space has a great flow all throughout. Truly took my breath away. We went over to the bar area and were greeted by Evan. Evan is a very passionate and knowledgeable bartender. You truly do not come across many bartenders who were on the level as he was. He truly was helpful in picking out appetizers and drinks and made us feel very comfortable. Super nice too! That always helps. :-) We order the Ahi tuna tartar and the calamari. Both extremely tasty. The calamari is on the spicier side so be prepared for a little caliente in your mouth. Our drinks were AMAZING! Presentation is key and also a great way to get buzzed/drunk. Ha! Every time I saw Evan make a new drink, I wanted one. I had the Black Orchid and the Bubbles and Razz (I forget the name of the second one). I won't go into detail as I think you should try one. Great place for drinks with the gals! Drinks are on the pricier side but totally worth it. Can't wait to go back! Ask for Evan at the bar! He is spectacular! Hope this review was helpful!"
8994,1662,5,0,9/29/2013,"My husband and I went to dinner at the Philadelphia Ocean Prime with another couple for the first time. The four of us have been dining out ˜together for years in Philly, New York, Europe, etc. We usually wouldn't go to a restaurant so new, preferring to wait til they work out the kinks, but we decided to take a chance. We were greeted by a bevy of friendly hostesses and sat promptly. The restaurant is beautiful. Dark wood, colored glass accents, and a glass enclosed kitchen create an elegant atmosphere. Our waiter, Chris was outstanding. Extremely personable and knowledgeable. He recommended and explained their house special cocktails in detail. We all took his advise and had four different drinks. They were all great. My gimlet made with cucumbers was soooo good. Chris went through the menu items, explaining preparations and making recommendations in every section. ˜We asked some questions about some of the dishes and ingredients and he had the answers to them all. They all sounded so good that none of us could make up our minds. After much hemming and hawing he suggested we let him put together a tasting menu of what he thought the best dishes were, and what wines would pair best with them. We left it all up to him and I'm glad we did. All the appetizers, main course and desserts were really, really good. The wines paired perfectly, and he didn't over order for us. (Which I've had happen with other waiters) A few of the standouts were the tuna tartare, ˜and a Scallop and braised rib appetizer. The sea bass and a bone in NY strip with black truffles were the main course favorites. The chocolate and peanut butter dessert was divine. We will be back. This is our newest Philly favorite. Make sure you ask for Chris if you want great service."
8995,1662,5,0,9/19/2013,"Was at Ocean Prime last night for restaurant week and can't say enougn about it. ˜The food was absolutely delicious. ˜We began with lobster bisque then crab cakes on a bed of corn, ˜These were not tiny portions as we all had doggie bags. ˜Also there specialty drink was a blackberry mule. ˜Also delicious. ˜Our server was Mike - very attentive. ˜Would I come back hell yeah !!!!!! ˜Oh I forgot the ten layer carrot cake - can't say enough about that either ˜ Pat M"
8996,1662,5,0,9/15/2013,"I went in last night with a friend, sat at the bar and had a great time! We ordered the Surf n Turf (Sea Scallops, Slow Braised Short Ribs), White Truffle Caviar Deviled Eggs, and my favorite the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli. The bartender Sabrina was very nice and made great suggestions. Overall the service and ambiance was great! I'll be back."
8997,1662,2,1,1/2/2015,"This is a no! It's not even a patch on butcher and singer and not even in the same league as Barclay Prime and yet the prices are. The dining room is an attack on the senses. Awful decor, reminiscent of what was thought to be impressive in the early noughties but is now just a little cringey and faux fancy. Upon entering you're faced with about 6 Lycra clad women who all fight to greet you and yet you're still left standing there in confusion whilst they work it out. Tables/ chairs are comfortable. Cocktails are meh. Waitress was helpful and friendly however bizarrely offered us her card when leaving so we could ask for her if booking for special occasions and would like ""confetti or rose petals on the table upon arrival"". Say wha? The sides were dismal, the steaks were similar to what I cook at home. For two starters, three steaks, two sides, one bottle of wine and three cocktails was $390 without tip. I'd never dream of returning. Save your money and tastebuds and go to Barclay Prime."
8998,1662,5,1,12/29/2014,"I had my birthday dinner at this restaurant and the food was delicious! ˜I had a steak medium rare cooked to perfection! The crab cakes seemed to be popular as all my guests ordered it! The service was great, and the restaurant itself is beautiful! The staff was very accommodating to my large dinner party, and the server was prompt with everyone's needs! Definitely a restaurant I would recommend and visit again !"
8999,1662,5,1,12/21/2014,Amazing service and food. ˜Pricey but it's well worth it. ˜Great ambiance but the service -- just awesome.
9000,1662,3,1,12/15/2014,"Both service and food were very good. Service was prompt, attentive, and our server did not make us feel rushed at any point during dinner, which is sometimes the case in busy restaurants. Steaks were flavorful and well seasoned. My Kansas City strip was slightly over cooked. When I communicated this to our server, she notified the chef who came to the table and offered to cook me another one to eat there or bring home. That was a really nice touch. Since the steak tasted good and I hate wasting food, I told the chef there was no need to worry. At the end of the meal, the manager came to the table and comp'ed the steak. I was not expecting this at all, so I was really impressed. For side I had the twice baked potato...yummy! And app was the surf and turf (scallops were a little sandy, but overall the dish was very good). I ordered the chocolate peanut butter dessert, which was outrageously good. Why not five stars? Wine list did not have that many choices under $50, and the worst part was the wait: 45 minutes past our reservation time, which is unacceptable in my book. Hostess kept telling us we were next and should have been upfront about the time."
9001,1662,3,1,12/15/2014,"I give stars for the gorgeous interior and excellent service. The food on the other hand wasn't so impressive. For such a pricey dining experience, the food should be really good, not just okay. The lobster was over cooked and the steak was bland.. Not to mention the cocktails had nearly no alcohol in them. Way too expensive for what they are serving."
9002,1662,4,1,12/14/2014,"The food is excellent for me however my partner thought his strip was overcooked. The chef came to the table and offered concern and the manager also did and took it off the bill so they are definitely all over customer service. The chief complaint is that we had a reservation for 8pm and had to wait 45 minutes to sit since they were overbooked. What bothered me the most was the mix of clientele. The dining room almost gave you the feeling gang members were present. I wonder if this is always the case or only because of the holidays. I observed large women without bras, guys with hats, pants without belts and boxers exposed, lots of gold chains and t-shirts. It was a scary vibe. On a gay note the bathrooms are clean and fabulous!"
9003,1662,4,1,12/12/2014,Some of the most skilled bartenders in the city work here. The wine selection is killer and the menu is great.
9004,1662,5,1,12/12/2014,"Was going to go to del friscos but thought we'd try something new. So glad we did. Amazing food and even more amazing service. Our waitress Crystal was probably the best waitress I've had in a really long time. Beyond insightful in regards to the menu and was very attentive. Five stars to Crystal ! I'd absolutely recommend the sea bass, very well cooked and fresh!"
9005,1662,4,1,12/10/2014,This place was fantastic! The drinks the food and what I really loved was the upscale contemporary atmosphere! Expensive but worth the price for a stylish night out.

9007,1662,4,1,12/10/2014,"I dined here twice and both times I've had great service. Both times were on the weekend and we sat in the upstairs balcony which was actually more private. I got the brisket and scallops that was actually an appetizer, however it was large enough as an entree. Their portions are all family style so a larger group fits this steak house. I am always pleasantly surprised that their cocktails are quite decadent for average priced drinks in center city. Mine had an edible flower frozen in a large sphere shaped ice cube and my friend got a super cool berry martini that gave off a 'dry ice' effect. We got the peanut butter ganache desert which was beautifully decorated and not too rich."
9008,1662,5,1,11/20/2014,Ocean prime made my boss's birthday the most memorable ever. ˜Wondering what took them so long to open for lunch.
9009,1662,5,1,11/6/2014,Had the fillet mignon and the blueberry cheesecake. Steak was so tender and cooked perfectly. Delicious! ˜The cheesecake was smooth and amazing.
9010,1662,5,1,10/28/2014,I thought the food and atmosphere was awesome. The food was fantastic and the service was too. I would highly recommend!
9011,1662,5,1,10/19/2014,"One of the best dining experiences I've had in Philly! My date and I did not have reservations (it was a kind of last minute decision), but the staff was very accommodating and even on a Saturday night we were seated within an hour. We spent our time waiting at the bar where the drinks were great (I had the Pear Grapefruit Fizz which came with a delicious slice of Asian pear in it). We had our appetizer (Ahi Tuna Tartare--highly recommend!) at the bar since it was full menu. We also ended up getting the Bubbles and Berries and the Black Orchid at dinner. The Black Orchid was definitely best tasting but Bubbles and Berries get extra points for presentation! The ambience was perfect for a fancier date and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. We ended up getting the Lobster Bisque and French Onion soups to start and for the entree we had the Salmon Teriyaki and the Chilean Sea Bass both of which were delicious. Highly recommend the sea bass! The truffle sauce on the mashed potatoes was perfect!"
9012,1662,4,1,9/22/2014,"Ok, my first impression was that of displeasure. ˜Yes, I know it was restaurant week, but when our 8:30 pm reservations were not satisfied until 9pm and I barely ate all day, this is the type of reaction you're going to get. ˜Annoyed and hungry, I wanted to give Ocean Prime a half a star to start. ˜HOWEVER, everything that mattered about the restaurant proved me wrong. ˜ The hostess sat us and apologized for the late seating, our waiter was friendly and as expected for a place like this. ˜I really liked the decor, modern and dark. ˜And even though it was restaurant week, my main entree, teriyaki salmon with sticky rice, was really really delicous. ˜Will definitely come back for seconds!"
9013,1662,5,1,9/22/2014,"Had to say, one of my best experiences was here at ocean prime. We had a table for 10 for a friends birthday and they were very accommodating from the minute we stepped in until we were showed out. As we were all comfortably seated the waitress went over the specials and was very knowledgable about their extensive menu. My girl and I had the chicken ratatouille and Kansas City rib eye which I must say was the one of the best steaks I've had in the city. The lobster mashed potato and Other side dishes ( which I can't recall at the moment) were very big proportioned. ˜Overall great experience and would definitely dine again."
9014,1662,5,1,9/21/2014,Absolutely amazing! We had a party of 10 and we had our own private room. The food was fabulous. First off the bread was a fresh baked sourdough and we had 3 rounds of it. It was the best bread I ever ate. ˜The lobster bisque soup was amazing and dipping the bread in was the icing on the cake! I had the scallop dinner which was so wonderful. My friends had the filet and it was to die for!! The sides are extra but they are big enough to share 2 or 3 people. I shared lobster mashed potatoes and let me say I could eat that everyday! It was pricey however it was so worth it!
9015,1662,4,1,9/17/2014,"Nice selection of wines including inexpensive but smooth house wines. ˜Salad was excellent in all ways. ˜Perfect amount of goat cheese, apple, nuts and great dressing. ˜Crab cakes were good as well. Reasonable lumps and little breading. ˜Dessert was good too. Service was ok - slightly slow. Only complaints were it is noisy and also a bit dark."
9016,1662,5,1,9/14/2014,"I've been to every Starr Restaurant in the city, and this place trumps them all. It's my favorite steak & seafood place within a 60 mile radius, so I highly recommend anyone looking for an awesome meal and wonderful dining experience to try them out. We've tried many of the dishes and they have all been delicious, and the wait service is fantastic. Their cocktail list is also very nice. ˜If you're looking for a 5 star dining experience, this is the place to go."
9017,1662,5,1,9/13/2014,"Five star service, food, and decor!!! I love this place! I have been wanting to come here for awhile now, so when I saw that it was restaurant week, I booked a reservation immediately! ˜Everyone in my bookclub was thorougly impressed. I had the apple goat cheese salad, salmon entree, and the butter pecan ice cream. My friend had the lobster bisque, but was mad she didn't get the salad. The waiter was awesome and attentive, basically everyone there was attentive and friendly. They weren't too stuffy like one would think at such an upscale restaurant. We read about the berries and bubbles drink and couldnt wait to try it. I enjoyed my drink and wanted to order another but didn't want the bookclub girls to see my lushy side! Lol! Overall, we had a great time and I recommend everyone to try it. I am Definitely going back!!!!!!"
9018,1662,4,1,9/10/2014,Went here last Sunday for my best friend's husband's birthday. The food was delightful!!! I had the Lobster Bisque. It did not turn soupy after sitting and the corn fritter they add topped it off! The house salad was sooooo good. My entr?e was the teriyaki salmon with sticky rice; omgeeeeee my taste buds were pleased!!!!! Dessert was their carrot cake. The cocktails are very creative!!! You will enjoy!! The service there is always very good. Oh and the kid's menu is the best selections I have seen for kids.
9019,1662,5,1,9/2/2014,Great food and great service. I will definitely be back. I had the chopped salad and a twice backed potato that was amazing :D We sat at the bar and had a server/bartender she was super helpful. I had the vodka infused with pineapple on the rocks! SOO YUMMY! WIll be back !!
9020,1662,4,1,9/1/2014,Amazing Mac and cheese and the pasta as good too. the place itself has a great ambiance and ritzy type feel as expected.
9021,1662,5,1,8/31/2014,Sooooo delicious! The lobster Mac &cheese is the best Mac&Cheese I have had in my life!!!! Excellent service very upscale place! Everything I had was divine!
9022,1662,5,1,8/24/2014,The service and food where outstanding from the calamari to the chocolate cake. Also the bubbling berries drink was good And exciting to see it bubble.
9023,1662,1,1,8/22/2014,Started at the bar. Then went to table. Service was horrific. Do NOT waste your time or well hard earned money. The bartenders are so cocky except the female blonde. But the service bartender was such a douche he ruined our night. ˜He was so disrespectful and unprofessional that he has no idea who he has been rude to.
9024,1662,5,1,8/10/2014,We have been three times and each time the food and service were excellent! ˜The sides are served family style and each one was great. ˜Love it there and would highly recommend. ˜The restaurant is very pretty inside with a really nice bar. ˜Can't wait to return!
9025,1662,4,1,8/6/2014,"I have been here twice and each time the service was good. The food was awesome. ˜I thoroughly enjoyed the calamari, but loved the surf and turf. The Chilean Sea Bass was cooked perfectly and the mashed with veggies was quite tasty. I even enjoyed the brussel sprouts. The desserts are massive and also quite delectable. ˜ The carrot cake is insanely delicious. ˜The blueberry lemon cheesecake was also a hit. ˜The baked alaska was insanely good and entirely too huge. Overall, ˜I'll be back!"
9026,1662,5,1,7/17/2014,"Fantastic food, great service and lovely atmosphere. Started with lobster bisque that was perfectly velvety. ˜Husband started with crab cakes that were the perfect mixture of crab more ˜crab and very little filler. ˜I had scallops, he had rib eye steak with sides of truffle mac and cheese and cream spinach. ˜Overall a lovely meal and we'll be back again."
9027,1662,4,1,7/15/2014,"Great happy hour with half price apps and a $5 melon-tini (super yum). I also love their calamari which is conveniently on the half prize assortment. Service was great, our waiter offered us another round just minutes before the special ended, a rare and most appreciated opposite of the up-sell. Cool vibe, sit upstairs in the booths if you get the chance."
9028,1662,5,1,7/13/2014,I came here for Center City SIPS on a whim and I'm glad I did. this is one of the classiest restaurants I've been to in center city and the atmosphere is nothing short of alluring. For an anniversary or other celebration I would highly recommend ocean prime!
9029,1662,5,1,6/27/2014,Had an amazing dinner at Ocean Prime. My mom and I were able to enjoy the happy hour specials and tried a variety of appetizers. Our top picks were the calamari and lobster mac and cheese. I wish I could remember our servers name but she was wonderful with helping us choose food and drink options.
9030,1662,5,1,6/3/2014,"This is definitely the place if you want to enjoy highest quality food, service and ambience. Well maybe not ambience. But if you feel like splurging, you won't be disappointed. We visited the place in October 2013 and were happy to get a table upstairs. Downstairs seemed a little crowded. Both our waitress and busboy were great. Attractive, funny and attentive. The food was delicious and ten layered carrot cake was the best damn dessert I've had in my life. Will definitely go back."
9031,1662,4,1,6/2/2014,"After reading the review Ocean Prime received from the food critic of the Philadelphia Inquirer, I went into our meal there with very low expectations. I usually take some of what he says with a grain of salt, but he had torn them apart so badly, it almost made me want to try it to see if it really was that bad. Luckily I got a gift card for dinner there for Christmas, so I took my fiance out there one night without having to actually shell out much $, so if it didnt go well, I wouldnt be too upset with it. Other than the service which I thought definitely needed some work, our meal was excellent. While we did not test the waters of dessert, we did have a delicious appetizer and entrees. Prices are steep dont get me wrong, but its a high end chain steak and fish house, so if you go in expecting not to drop some serious dough, you are expecting too much. Do I think the prices of the fish entrees are fair? Not really, but they werent so high that I would never come back. We wound up starting with a beer and a lychee martini as well as the tuna tartar. It was not what I have come to know as a traditional beef tartar, but it was delicious nonetheless. It was layered with avocado and drenched in a salty and tangy ginger, ponzu sauce. The tuna was incredibly tender and paired surprisingly well with the creamy avocado. My entree, a filet of blackened snapper served over a bed of vegetables and a corn tartar, left my nostrils running quite a bit. But the sting of that spice enhanced the flavor of that delicately flaky white fish so well, I devoured each and every bite. I was less impressed with the corn tartar, the texture was very mushy and the sauce just made it more soggy. I could have done with just the fish and the veggies to be honest. My fiance ordered the teriyaki salmon with shittake sticky rice and soy butter sauce. The fish and the rice were outstanding. The glaze was sticky and sweet on the exterior of the charred fish and the rice had amazing texture. However again I thought the plate was oversauced and I really didnt think it needed the sauce at all. Overall it was a really nice meal and a fancy schmancy place. You will definitely drop some coin, but although the service is a bit spotty and the fish entrees are oversauced, there is still some great food to be had."
9032,1662,4,1,5/22/2014,Theatrical drinks..... THEATRICAL DRINKS..... need I say more? Gorgeous place the decor and ambiance reminiscent Del Friscos but this is my new favorite spot.
9033,1662,4,1,5/22/2014,Have to say pretty great dining experience. ˜Have to try the mac and cheese probably the best mac and cheese I've ever had. ˜I had the steak bone-in Filet which was a great cut of meat. ˜I would of liked to see a bit more searing or char on the outside of this but that is a personal preference. ˜It was prepared to the right temp perfectly. ˜My lady had sea bass which was really good I stole some. ˜The service was Excellent. ˜Only thing holding the review back is just my personal preference of how the steak was cooked.
9034,1662,4,1,5/17/2014,"We had a few ups and downs at Ocean Prime and tonight was definitely an up. First we started at the bar with Jasmine watching the horse races (Preakness) and had a fabulous couple of cocktails, Then we went to the dining room where we had David who was great at offering our dinner and making our meal and wine most enjoyable. Lindsay the manager came over and made sure everything was to our liking. The food (halibut special and filet steak) were perfectly cooked. All and all a great enjoyable evening and California Chrome won the triple crown, how good is that!?!?"
9035,1662,5,1,5/16/2014,"Excellent service by Drew, excellent food, and beautiful atmosphere!! Perfect for a night out or a special occasion!!"
9036,1662,1,1,4/26/2014,"I actually thought walking in here last night was a joke. The staff are all dressed like cheap prostitutes especially the extremely unfriendly bartenders. Ordered 3 different cocktails at the bar, all of them had less than the appropriate count of liquor, priced at 12-14 dollars each. If these were made correctly I would have no problem spending that much. Each person working last night had a horrible attitude and was extremely rude I will definitely not be back."
9037,1662,5,1,4/7/2014,My wife and I wanted to try this new Philly restaurant out. ˜We were amazed with our experience. ˜The food was amazing! ˜The seabass was very tasteful and fresh. ˜Our Ribeye was a bit on the saltier side but that was the least of our worries. ˜I enjoye their huge wine selections. ˜The staff was very friendly. ˜We would definitely come back.
9038,1662,4,1,3/26/2014,"I really enjoyed it here! Great food, great service and great ambiance. It is a bit loud when crowded but what do you expect? I will definitely be back!"
9039,1662,5,1,3/22/2014,"This is going to be short and sweet. From beginning to the end I loved everything about. The service was impeccable. Our was waiter (Dae) was OUTSTANDING I could not have asked for better service. He was very helpful with our food choices and helping my boyfriend and I find the right drink. After test tasting some of their wines I didn't really like any of them so he went and told ""maybe the drink manager"" idk that we could not find something and she made something that was absolutely perfect and fit the taste that we were looking for. The food was delicious and it was just a great experience. I would say this is the best restaurant that I have visited with outstanding food, service and atmosphere."
9040,1662,5,1,3/15/2014,Very good service and great food. The staff is good and don't rush you out the door. I would recommend to anyone
9041,1662,5,1,3/12/2014,Came here for a girls night and absolutely loved it ! It's such a beautiful place. We ordered steak and sea bass to share and it was delicious. I'm not a big fan of Mac and cheese but we ordered it to try and I fell in love. This is definitely a good place for a date.
9042,1662,5,1,3/7/2014,They have excellent service here. I think the best service I ever experienced. I loved how they split both our entree on both of our dish. My friend ˜had The Seabass and I had the spicy red snapper! They're both was so delicious ! I'm a big fan of cheesecake so we ordered the blueberry lemon cheesecake and it is to die for. I would love to jus order a whole cheesecake from them !
9043,1662,5,1,2/12/2014,"It's excessively expensive and a la cart, just like any high class steakhouse. I like that they also concentrate on seafood. I went for restaurant week and it was phenomenal. One drink each for my date and I and the bill topped $115 even at Restaurant Week prices. Great dining experience though. Superb service even though it was CCRW. The steak was absolutely amazing. Melted in your mouth and made you forget where you were sitting. I would equate Ocean Prime with Butcher & Singer, though given my choice of the two I think I would go to B & S...both are amazing"
9044,1662,5,1,2/9/2014,"Excellent food, great service, atmosphere is beautiful.... Management ˜ensures great service from the second you arrive... One of Philla's best !!"
9045,1662,5,1,2/7/2014,"What can I say?! ˜This is a top notch spot and everyone needs to check it out at least once! ˜It's pricey but you really get what you pay for. ˜We went for my husband's bday and everything we ordered was amazing! ˜French onion soup, ahi tuna app, filet, seabass, cheesy jalapeno pots, and the truffle mac and cheese is to DIE FOR! ˜Even the drinks was amazing! ˜Try the specialty whiskey one! ˜Our waiter, Dae, ˜was great too...he gave perfect suggestions and even brought out the chocolate covered peanut mousse on the house! ˜LOVE this place!"
9046,1662,5,1,2/3/2014,Went here for appetizers for my boyfriends birthday. The Calamari was amazingggggg the best I've had! The sesame coating was delicious. I ordered the Truffle devil eggs and we also ordered truffle fries. The appetizers were all very good. The decor was very nice and the staff was very good as well. Next time I return I will have dinner and dessert as well!
9047,1662,3,1,2/3/2014,"Went to dinner for Restaurant week. The food and drinks were really good - not great. However, the reason I'm rating it a 3 was due to the staff. Our waiter ran my card for more than my meal - either he's an idiot or pocketed at least $70 as a ""tip"" for the evening. Be careful and check your credit card after dining here - OR use cash. Go to Del Friscos down the block. Better food, ambiance and service."
5127,1662,4,1,2/1/2014,"The prime margarita is yummy and the bar has a good happy hour special with half of drinks. I came for restaurant week with some friends on a Friday night and we had a great time. While waiting for the rest of the group to arrive my friend and I had Prime margaritas at the bar and some of their Parmesan oysters, which were really great. I think that was the first time i'd ever had a cooked oyster and I loved it! For dinner I had the lobster bisque (always a good soup choice), the filet (cooked perfectly juicy) and the carrot cake. Yum! Everything was great, but especially the carrot cake. OMG the icing with little sugar crystals on top. It was huge piece of cake and probably would have been better off sharing with someone, but it was so good. I'd like to come back and try Ocean Prime again."
9048,1662,5,1,1/29/2014,"Yes I went ˜the 2nd week of Restaurant Week, yes the place was BUSY, but you know what ? I had a great dining experience .We started ˜with Berries and Bubbies. what ˜. an amazing little high powered fruity drink. a little overpriced but hey I'm getting a deal on the meal. The 6 of us were seated in a corner ˜dining room perfect for our group. Our server introduced herself and proceeded with taking wine orders. The bus boy was filling water glasses . Both were very polite. I ordered the steak which to my surprised was cooked the way I like it ..Medium .it was juicy and tender . My sting beans and potatoes were nicely prepared . Dessert was the five layer carrot cake with a pineapple sauce . I did not care for the sauce but the cake was moist,, tender and flavorful . I will ˜revisit . To those that ˜did not have a pleasant bar/dining experience I suggest you revisit on non Restaurant Week day. This place is not to be missed"
9049,1662,1,1,1/27/2014,"So after much talk and hype about this establishment, my friends and I decided to give it ˜try during Restaurant Week! Let's just say NEVER AGAIN!! Our server was Kevin and he was the absolute worst.He seemed annoyed with our table from the very beginning. He was extremely rude and obnoxious. For ˜starters he got our drink order wrong and when we told him about it his response was ""well I don't make the drinks"". Next it took him another 20 minutes for Kevin to take our order. While my friend was eating her caesar salad, she stops and pulls a staple out of her mouth!!! We informed our server, he was just so nonchalant about it he went and got the manager. The manager came over and was very apologetic and was concern for her well being. He also offered to replaced the salad, which she declined. ˜The main course came out which was the teriyaki salmon and my guests had filet Mignon. The food was bland,tasteless.Not once did he come to check on us to ask was everything ok, but the manager did. He avoided our table like the plague, ok. The next time we did see our dear server he decided to bring our dessert over which we declined. He got an attitude with us. Like seriously dude!!!, if you would have came over to our table you would have know we wanted our dessert to go. Later he brought out a huge slice of chocalate cake and a scoop of ice icream as a courtesy for the mishap earlier on behalf of the manager. I have never been so happy to have the check come while out dining. The best part about Ocean Prime was leaving! I will be avoiding this place just like Kevin avoided us!"
9050,1662,1,1,1/27/2014,"My experience at this allegedly fine dining restaurant was everything, but fine. My guests and I went to this establishment 1/24/2014 to enjoy an evening of food, drinks and laughter, little did we know we had a rude awakening. The ambience was relaxing and pleasant as of the majority of restaurants we dine at, but the service was HORRIBLE!!!! Our waiter Kevin was rude, unpleasant, & hardly ever came to check on us to see if we needed anything. Not only that, but one of my guest was eating a salad & I noticed her pull something out her mouth & examine it, so I was intrigued to know what it was & come to my dismay it appeared to be a staple of some sort. Of course we were hesitant to tell our lovely waiter because of his attitude, but we had no choice and he was a bit obnoxious about the situation. The manager came over and confirmed, yes in fact it was a staple and said that whatever packaging the lettuce comes in have staples that the cooks ""try"" and remove. He apologized and asked if he could replace the salad, but come on buddy let's be realistic who would want another salad after that!! After our meal which was not all that great either, they attempted to appease us with a slice of chocolate cake for us to share. All I could think of was Marie Antoinette ""Let Them Eat Cake"". After I told fellow colleagues of this atrocious experience they said either they have had bad experiences at this establishment or knew someone that has. I am not returning and will not recommend any of my friends, colleagues or even enemies to this establishment!!! I will definitely make it known to others about my experience."
9051,1662,3,1,1/24/2014,"So this is a strange one.... Been here 2 times. ˜First time I came here for guys night I thought this is a top tier steakhouse in the city. ˜The atmosphere is awesome, very high ceilings and the bar goes all the way up with really cool lighting and decorations. ˜The most important part to me personally is service and I absolutely loved it. Our waiter Chris was very friendly, made some great suggestions, and gave us great details about different types of meats, so we can determine which steak each one of us prefers. The drinks were also really good..... The berry martini with the smoke and bubbles is really cool and definitely different.. ˜Chris gave us his card after dinner and welcomed us back. ˜He even mentioned that he would do his best to be our waiter if we request him In advance. ˜If i rated the restaurant after this night, I would of given it 5 stars. However, there was a second time that I came here on a date. ˜The girl that waited on us was an amateur, she probably waitressed at some diner prior to being here. She wasnt friendly, and was clueless about the menu. ˜She even screwed up the coffee by bringing us 2 french presses when I told her I want 2 small cups of coffee. Instead of apologizing, she blamed it on me saying I asked for ""2 cups"", and still charged for both even though we only had one. ˜This place is still new, ˜and im sure they will filter thru all the bad servers within the first year. ˜once the veterans are in place this place will be superb. For now, im going to stick to coming here for happy hour and will save my $100+/person dinners for another place. ˜I will review this again in 6 months and hopefully my feelings will change."
9052,1662,3,1,1/24/2014,Interesting experience. Good was above average not great. Lobster Bisque was great! Service was ok. Prefer Del Friscos over this.
9053,1662,4,1,1/20/2014,"Great new spot for seafood in center city Philadelphia . This chain originating in Florida offers a variety of unique variations on traditional seafood dishes in a supper club style atmosphere. Every dish is flavorful and portioned well. Salmon and Chilean Sea Bass are my favorites, however the filet mignon was very good as well. Carrot cake is their signature dessert and the ahi tuna appetizer or truffle deviled eggs are not to be missed. We were very impressed with the service and atmosphere of this restaurant, will be back soon!"
9054,1662,5,1,1/18/2014,Had cocktails and dined with a friend on Tuesday night 1/14/14. It was lively at the bar and in the restaurant. 30 to 40 something crowd dressed well. Sports on the TV at both ends of the bar and light pop/rock music faintly in the background. Food was fantastic and service was very good. Had the Kansas City Strip cook medium which was excellent and flavorful.
9055,1662,4,1,1/14/2014,"Definitely a place you want to return. Quality of food and service are in line with their reputation. ˜It's a lively place with great bar scene. Great fro business dinners, friends or even a date! the combination of having great seafood and steaks is not new, but you have to excel at it. I ordered the NY Strip and it was absolutely perfect! Sorry, but I behaved and skipped dessert, but they looked great."
6827,1662,3,1,1/9/2014,"The middle of the menu offers a list of cuts that can be customized using the ""Accessories"" list (e.g., ""Blue Cheese Crust"" or ""Truffle Butter""). ˜The right side of the menu lists more than a handful of potato-based accompaniments, plus a good selection of begetable and other sides, like Truffled Mac and Cheese. ˜The left side contains classic appetizers, plus some new ones, like Truffled Deviled Eggs. ˜Happy Hour Menu has more snacky eats, like Truffled Garlic Fries. ˜You'll find seafood on this menu too, but mostly just classics. ˜Most expensive is Chilean Sea Bass at $43 a pop. Wine list is adequate, plus a Captain's list with more pricey ""rare"" selections. ˜No Sommelier, but wait staff claims to be knowledgeable. ˜Bar is first-name friendly, so you can impress your guests by calling out their names. Food was acceptable, selections on par with Del Frisco's. ˜GM traveled to each table, ensuring satisfaction. Great stop for business lunch or dinner, or to impress that gold-digging girlfriend whose palate extends to a big, juicy steak or piece of fish. ˜Some creativity at the bar with a Black Orchid containing an ice cube with an actual orchid frozen into it. ˜Happy Hour price for this drink was $7.00. Consumed: Crab cake - large, mostly crab, with a pan-fried crust abed a delicate hollandaise sauce. ˜Delicious! Seafood salad - chunks of crab, shrimp and (i think) scallops. ˜Eh, this was so-so. ˜It's basically seafood on top of ice berg lettuce - or was that romaine? ˜Skip it and get the crab cocktail - or share the seafood tower. Lobster bisque - okay, nothing special. Oysters - 3 east coast and 3 west coast. ˜ Oysters from the west coast smelled of ""pier"" and were sent back. ˜They were immediately replaced with a complimentary crab cocktail and a chef's visit. ˜Kudos for the service. Truffled Mac and Cheese - OMG, this is the bestest mac and cheese I've ever had. ˜A bit strong at first, but then became craveable after the 3rd bite. ˜I need more of this. Chilean Sea Bass - at $43, this was the most expensive dish on the menu. ˜It arrived with a sauce that showed signs of a cooling, having that tell-tale dairy-based ""skin"". ˜Fish was perfectly cooked atop a bed of tasty whipped potatoes, sprinkled with capers and slivers of carrot and some other green vegetable - haricot vert? ˜Sauce was bland. ˜Mixed with bites of truffled mac and cheese, the dish became better. ˜A soy-ginger glaze is really the best preparation for this fish, people, c'mon. Petite, 7oz filet mignon - I was unable to get a review on this, as my dining partner couldn't stop eating it long enough to comment. ˜I assume it was good... Key lime tart - arrived with vertical ribbons of white chocolate. ˜Zesty lime flavors, creme fresh and graham crust. ˜Good. ˜White chocolate was missing that rich white chocolate flavor (more waxey). ˜Tasted like that off-brand, white chocolate bunny your parents try to give you on Easter."
5320,1662,1,1,1/2/2014,"Seriously worst service ever. ˜I don't understand why my friends keep going back here for another night sitting around their bar area. ˜From waiting 2 rounds of drinks of the table nextvto us to get our first drink order in to the 5 + min wait to get silverware while your food gets cold, to the total disappointment in the taste (or lack thereof) the food, other than its physical location, I can't see any reason for anyone to ever dine ˜here! If you're going to have to meet people here, be sure to eat first and be prepare to wait for your drinks!"
9056,1662,5,1,1/1/2014,"I was here for NYE 2014. Everything was great. I had the best steak of my life, I had the 10 oz filet mignon. That was too much steak to finish, but every bite was delicious. I also had a specialty cucumber cocktail that was fresh and perfectly balanced. I will come back when I return to Philly."
9057,1662,4,1,12/26/2013,This place has recently recevied some bad press (zero bell review). ˜I was clearly surprised by this. ˜I should clarify that I did not eat dinner here but instead had drinks and 2 apps at the bar. ˜I thought the place was very pretty and majestic when first walking in. ˜For apps we had the avocado dish and calamari. ˜I thought they both were absolutely amazing and I am not so easily pleased!
9058,1662,4,1,12/20/2013,"I'll start off with I don't give any restaurant five stars. ˜Went with a small group of four last night for a 7PM reservation. ˜ Got there about 6:15 and went to the bar. ˜Still happy hour. ˜Yay! ˜Decided to try a couple of their signature drinks. ˜Cant remember the name but one had a frozen edible orchid in it. ˜It was good. ˜Ended up with two of these during the evening. ˜Also tried the cucumber gimlet. ˜Refreshing. ˜We were seated for our reservation about 7:10. ˜Didn't really mind because we were enjoying the bar area and our drinks. ˜Good bartenders and helpful with my choices. When seated we all agreed that the table for four was really too small. ˜Had to be careful not to knock over water glasses when reaching for bread and later the shared sides. ˜ We weren't too close the adjoining tables so that wasn't a problem. ˜We ordered a bottle of wine that we researched before we went and it was quite reasonable. ˜I wont mention the price. ˜We aren't wine snobs so we were fine with the selection. We all ordered different appetizers. ˜My husband had the lobster bisque and he said it was good. ˜I had the goat cheese raviolis. ˜Yum. ˜Another had the scallops and short ribs and another had the tuna tartar. ˜All were good. For our main courses we had tuna, salmon, filet mignon and lobster tails. ˜All were good and cooked appropriately. ˜Yummy carrots, broccoli and truffle mac and cheese. ˜We were getting so full that we could finish the sides. ˜I should have taken them home but didn't. We had coffee and shared chocolate cake and cr?me brulee. I had read the review in Sundays Inquirer and wasn't sure whether we should still go. ˜Thought about cancelling our reservations but decided to make up our mind ourselves. ˜Glad we went. ˜No complaints here on food or services. ˜ We would go again for a special occasion or happy hour for drinks. ˜Beautiful space and parking was easy although if you aren't going any place afterward valet (before tip) is $11 cheaper than the parking garage just next door."
9059,1662,5,1,12/12/2013,"We loved this place! ˜We were staying nearby and were looking for a place that had great meat, fish, and vegetarian options as we are a mixed crew. ˜We stepped inside very impressed and liked what we saw on the menu, so made reservations. Our server was excellent, best service we've had in a while, and the food was delicious. ˜Our steak eater was impressed, our fish eater was mesmerized, and our vegetarians very happy : ) ˜The 10 layer carrot cake was a major hit, and the wine choice was excellent. ˜It felt quiet and intimate at our upstairs table, even though the large place was packed, not an empty seat at the colorful bar! We will be back next time we're in town, and if you live there definitely check it out!"
9060,1662,1,1,12/9/2013,Still bad!!!! ˜Food is dismal. ˜Sliders were rare bordering on raw. ˜Calamari dish tasted like bad bad Chinese food. ˜I have a gift card which paid for this dreck but ˜am upset because I have $$ left on it so likely need to return. ˜Maybe I'll just get a homeless person a steak from here.. but they probably wouldnt like it either
9061,1662,5,1,12/6/2013,"I haven't even gotten home yet and I'm writing this review. That's how good our experience was! We decided on Ocean Prime at the last minute and didn't have reservations for a Friday night. The hostess found us a table for five despite a packed house. Our server Jadyn was fantastic, super attentive and friendly. We were celebrating my dad's birthday and he said the wedge salad and carrot cake were the best he's had. He also raved about the pork dish. I had the blackened snapper and it was TO DIE FOR. White chocolate key lime tart was also really good. We will no doubt be back again."
9062,1662,4,1,11/26/2013,"I frequent the bar area and have appetizers there and love it! ˜The staff is great, the apps are wonderful (LOVE the surf and turf which is seared scallops and braised short ribs over mashed potatoes. ˜The popcorn at the bar is phenomenal (I know, it's just popcorn, but it really is!), and the Berries and Bubbles is one of the best tasting, and definitely the most dramatic, drink in the city!"
9063,1662,3,1,11/25/2013,"I was really looking forward to trying this new ˜steak and seafood restaurant, wondering why would Philadelphia need another place like this. Within a several block radius, you already have Del Frisco's and Butcher and Singer. ˜My test was the NY Strip, ordered medium rare. ˜This is how I would rate the three steak houses. ˜Still #1- Butcher and Singer by a long shot. ˜I've never liked the steaks at Del Frisco's (always over seasoned) but the NY stripsteak at Ocean Prime was one of the worst I have had. Poorly cooked, leathery and without any deep flavor. ˜I must say the service was outstanding and Ocean Prime is a beautiful room and bar area. ˜I will not be back for dinner, but will return for the bar scene."
9064,1662,5,1,11/19/2013,"I've been here for both happy hour and for dinner. Happy hour is amazing, truffle fries were so good, and pretty good drink specials. Lots of people, making for a good scene after work. Also had a delicious dinner. Lobster bisque and wedge starters- both great. Had the scallops and short rib for entree and it was awesome! Other people at my table got the filet and thought it was cooked perfectly. Got the carrots, Mac and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes for sides and I recommend all of them- the carrots were surprisingly good! Sweetly glazed. Service was great, beautiful restaurant. Though there are a lot of high end steak house places, ocean prime is still worth a visit."
9065,1662,3,1,11/11/2013,"I'm so bummed about this place. SO bummed. ˜I could not wait to try it and was soo excited for this new addition to the coveted corner at 15th & Sansom. ˜I'm a huge lover of both steaks and seafood, and know how to spot good quality. I will say the two highlights of my night were 1) walking in to this restaurant which is beautiful and smells of truffle (I would live in a house of truffle if I could) and 2) my appetizer, the Ahi Tuna Tartare. ˜I would give that dish 6 stars if I could! The fresh quality of the tuna, mixed with the crunchy rice cracker in the middle and ripe lovely avocado on the bottom literally melted in my mouth. It all went down hill with the entrees. ˜I ordered the filet mignon, per usual for my steak preference, and was truly disappointed at the quality of the steak. ˜It was chewy and tough (closer to a strip or rib-eye) and pretty dry, and not even the $4 truffle butter I ordered on top could salvage this experience. So sad :( My mother (an avid lobster lover) ordered the twin lobster tails and had them sent back twice. The first time they were over-seasoned (to which, our odd-mannered server ensured her that there were ""no seasonings to worry about""...wtf does that even mean?!) The second time they were brought out, without any seasoning, they had a pungent fishy-flavor which is not normal for high-quality lobster. ˜The manager agreed that the chefs concurred that they didn't taste right. (Side note, my boyfriend ordered the Kansas City Strip which was DELICIOUS and fluffy and wonderful. ˜For $44, seems about right). The bar and the restaurant itself are beautiful, and the manager was very accomodating to our experience. ˜I may go back in the future, but probably only for drinks and appetizers at the bar!"
9066,1662,2,1,11/7/2013,"I had so much hope for this place but the food was awful. The restaurant is beautiful and the service was top-notch, but damn they do not know how to cook a steak. I ordered the filet and it had zero seasoning on it. I ordered it medium and it came out blood rare. Sides were mediocre. Honestly dessert was the best part of the meal. For the price this place is not even in the same league as Del Frisco's or Butcher Singer."
9067,1662,4,1,11/6/2013,"The bar snacks and happy hour was great... bar is small restaurant is beautiful... the bar tender was not that attentive...but food came out fast...had truffle fries, calamari, deviled eggs...all were great! HH prices and selection was great! Would go back hopefully the bartender is a lil faster when my glass is empty..( side bar she wasn't busy making drinks just busy talking with coworkers and posing)"
9068,1662,5,1,11/4/2013,"Food was fantastic, serive was fantastic, the ambience was fantastic! A very nice dining experience indeed!"
9069,1662,5,1,11/2/2013,Just returned from a fantastic dinner at Ocean Prime. The decor and ambiance really helped make the night feel special. Wait til you see their bar--quite a colorful view. The service was a little erratic at times (our entrees came out while we were finishing our apps) but overall excellent. The food was cooked to perfection! My wife and our friends each had the Ivory Salmon special while I ate the Scallops and Short Rib app for dinner. Everything was amazing and the Baked Alaska was the perfect way to top off the evening. Will certainly go back again.
9070,1662,3,1,10/31/2013,Met a friend here for happy hour recently. Drinks were decent and so were the appetizers. I would like to see them offer less fried apps with healthier options and perhaps more specialty cocktails in smaller glasses.
9071,1662,5,1,10/24/2013,OMG!!!' Best service best food and just seriously everything to the best there is :D Even fixed a none alcoholic beer for this poor foreign boy :D Honestly best night of my vacation so far A++ It's a shame not to have gone here
9072,1662,5,1,10/21/2013,My evening here was excellent. ˜The atmosphere was my favorite part of this restaurant. ˜Its full of people dressed great and ready to enjoy a night out. ˜Our server Crystal was wonderful. ˜She was insightful and funny. ˜Always made sure we had what we needed and were enjoying our orders. ˜From the surf and turf and crab cake appetizers to the delicious 10 layer carrot cake... Everything tasted and looked great. ˜Even the petals that were frozen into the ice cube in my cocktail. ˜Pick a date. ˜Make reservations. ˜And get over to this place. ˜Its amazing....
9073,1662,5,1,10/16/2013,"Great Atmosphere, Great Service, Great Food, Great Wine.... What else can you ask for on a special night out? A bit pricey, but you already know that going into a place like this so no surprise there. Our waitress was friendly, big smile, and completely knowledgeable on all the wines on the list and helped us find the perfect white for the night, a Riesling, which I might add was 50% off per bottle. ˜(They are running a special this time of year.) ˜ The staff of any restaurant can either make it or break it for the establishment and she did not disappoint. ˜ Will I be going back? ˜Ohhh ya! ˜Not a place I'd go to on the spur of the moment. ˜I'd save this place for that special occasion, with that special someone. Ocean Prime, downtown Philly, doesn't get much better for a city this size. ˜Keep up the good work."
9074,1662,5,1,10/14/2013,"This place is rad. There was no part of my experience with which I had a problem. ˜Drinks at the bar were great. ˜The food was spectacular. ˜The atmosphere was energetic and lively. ˜And, I received some of the best service I've ever had. ˜Thank you, Kevin. ˜And thanks to everyone at Ocean Prime for providing my friends and I with an unforgettable night."
9075,1662,5,1,10/3/2013,Great happy hour! Great selection of 4.00 bottled beers. ˜7.00 wines and mixed drink specials. ˜The Calamari is killer at 7.00 as well. ˜Beautiful inside and friendly staff. ˜This is my new go to place
9076,1662,5,1,9/28/2013,"The bartenders are so fun and make a great drink. Went here for restaurant week and really enjoyed my meal. Our table was in a side room though and I would of enjoyed being In the main dining area more. Also, busers could be a bit more attentive in removing unused glasses and plates to create space. Had I not liked my food and cocktails so much, this rating would of been a 4."
9077,1662,5,1,9/26/2013,"Stopped in last Saturday, it was really busy and after eating there I can see why. ˜Everything we ordered was delicious : surf n turf appetizer, seafood cobb salad, filet mignon, truffle mac n cheese and the side of mushrooms. ˜Great service from Patrick the manager and our server Seth, will definitely be eating here again soon."
9078,1662,5,1,9/26/2013,"Amazing!! I went with a friend for restaurant week and since I was running late they were able to push our reservation back 30 minutes with out a problem. We sat at the bar until our table was ready and the bartender helped my friend choose a glass of wine and made me a wonderful dirty martini with blue cheese olives I love so much. Though the hostesses had some trouble finding us for our table and we ended up sitting 20 minutes late, they were very apologetic and we were fine, just hungry. Our waiter, Steve, was fantastic as well. He got us another round, and extra olives for me, and even sent out a complimentary appetizer of their tuna tartar (I think to make up for waiting for the table) which was incredibly tasty and I devoured most of it. We each got the lobster bisque which was poured table-side, who doesn't love that? She got the scallops with Parmesan risotto while I got the crab cakes with succotash and we split an order of the Parmesan truffle fries. We were so full from the appetizer, soups, bread, and drinks that we barely touched our food. Steven was find enough to wrap up everything, including the carrot cake for dessert, to go and split the fries between the 2 of us. Though we sat late, we were never rushed out and there were still plenty of tables sitting when we left. The meal was just as tasty the next day as leftovers and I would go back in a heart beat. Ask for Steve!"
9079,1662,1,1,9/24/2013,"When reading a review, it is unfortunate that one does not know the level of excellence required by that reviewer. If it's, ""It's great if I don't have to cook it"", any restaurant is just fine. I was waiting to see what establishment would take over this beautiful building. When I saw that it was part of a chain, I was not thrilled but determined ˜ to give it a fair shake with no prejudices. We are just one block away, so this place would have been ideal. We were four people all of the same opinion. ˜Perhaps drinks enhance the taste of the food, but we did not have any on this occasion. The decorator's have done a stunning job on the interior of this building. Sadly the food is no match for all that money spent nor is the chef. The food at best is mediocure. ˜The prices are high. The salad was OK. ˜The lobster bisque is poured over embellishments in the soup plate at your table. It would be nice of the liquidity of the soup was that, but it needs to be scooped rather than poured from the server's pitcher. ˜The taste was just OK. Two of us ordered crab cakes. ˜They are served over a corn broth and very generous in size. ˜The taste, ˜is very spicy ˜with lots of filler. I tasted no crab meat. The opinion from both diners was the same on this. ˜One person ordered a filet, medium rare. I came well done and looked like shoe leather. When the only thing that is a standout is the dessert it is not worth the trip unless you are just havng dessert. Even little dinky restaurants have a decaf cappuccino machine.They don't, so we ordered plain decaff."
9080,1662,5,1,9/22/2013,"I am hesitant to give out a 5 star rating to restaurants, but Ocean Prime earned each star! My sister and I went, without rezzos, on a Wednesday during restaurant week at 7:30. They were happy to accommodate us and barely made us wait. We had the dream team serving us--Robert and his associate James. Honestly-they were so hospitable and friendly and on top of things that we asked to speak to a a manager when we were done to compliment the service. On top of impeccable service, the food was delish! The menu for restaurant week was basically their normal menu, they only opened the week before so used the event to highlight their top dishes...and they sure did that! The bread they give you...AMAZING! i think its a sourdough and youll need to physically restrain yourself from devouring the whole warm loaf. Lobster bisque to start - very good flavor with some nice lobster pieces. I got the scallops and my sister got the filet. Scallops were good-as expected, but the filet! It melted in your mouth! The flavor was stupendous. Whipped potatoes super tasty too. Finished with 10 layer carrot cake and the sorbet of the day (mango apricot) and cake was solid-little lemony so refreshing, and sorbet was bomb delicious. Great wine list too with plenty of options in different price points. Cool ambiance, I can see that it could draw a hoity-toity crowd, but I think you could get away with nice jeans ( ladies and gentlemen). Definitely returning and will definitely ask for Robert!"
7161,1662,1,1,9/22/2013,"I went to Ocean prime during restaurant week I was super excited to go. When I went the Decor and ambience was very beautiful. I went with two of my other friends for restaurant week and we all ordered the steak. I ordered a medium well steak and my one friend ordered a medium rare steak. When are steaks came I was given a medium rare and my friend got rare. That's not what we ordered. I told the waiter that I wanted to cook a little bit more this was not a medium well steak. When I got my steak back it was still the same. It looked as if they put it in the boiler for a hot second and that was it. It was still really bloody in the middle. The waiter was super apologetic the manager was apologetic but at the same time his tone was like ""whatever"". He also looked really young. Like in his early to mid twenties. As if he just finished hospitality school. If you're going to be across from Del Frisco steakhouse you better be on your ""A"" game all the time. After my steak was sent back to my table a second time, I just was like I don't even want it anymore. I just lost all interest in wanting to eat. It was very frustrating. Yes, I understand that they only been open for less than a month. That is why you have a soft opening to fix these problems. The chef should still know how to cook steak. That cooking basics 101. It's just insulting to the customer that the steak was sent back to me second time and not cooked properly again. The chef should be embarrassed. I did write on the Ocean Prime comment card. Overall, I really wanted to like Ocean Prime but I was very disappointed I did like our waiter he was very generous very apologetic and did everything to make myself and my friends very comfortable and still be able to enjoy our evening. If I do ever go back to Ocean prime it would just be for drinks that's it. I will go to Del Frisco's for steak. The funny thing is I really liked the private room on the second floor and thought that room with the overlooking view of the whole restaurant would be a perfect spot to host my next dinner party. After my experience it knocked that idea out of the running so know I have to look at other places."
9081,1662,4,1,9/19/2013,"It is always a pleasure dining with my fellow friend from grad school days, whose like a brother from another. We pulled up to valet and received a hearty welcome and fast escort into restaurant where we were greeted by an onslaught of hostess. One of whom escorted us to a table paralleling the kitchen. The seating was half booth but quite comfy. The place was gorgeous, adorned by rich browns and accents mirroring the deep sea. We dined for restaurant week which gave us an opportunity to sample the menu in three courses. I feasted on: 1. Appetizer: Lobster Bisque with Corn Fritter 2. Entree: Crab Cake with corn and Succatash 3. Dessert: Ten- Layer Carrot Cake with pineapple anglaise To accompany our meal, we also had the white truffle deviled eggs with our cocktails (blueberries & bubbles and Tequila Cocktail) before our meal and added the black truffle Mac and Cheese ˜as an accompanying side with our entree. Perusing the al la carte menu, there are so many mouth-watering options that I'll be sure to give a try in future visits. Our waiter Michael was prompt and attentive and certainly not over bearing. We provided compliments to the chef and were astounded by the ambiance, friendliness of fellow customers and well-portioned menu. Ocean Prime May be new to the scene but they are definitely off to a great start."
9082,1662,5,1,9/18/2013,"Sit at the bar.....popcorn unbelievable. ˜Drinks amazing , bartenders friendly and the food ....salad, scallops, steak all delicious! ˜I highly recommend it and I can't wait to go back."
9083,1662,3,1,9/18/2013,"So we decided to come and check out the hype. We went with the Restaurant Week menu, because we're suckers for a deal and added a dozen oysters for good measure. The oysters were good. They tended towards larger and more briny than I prefer - but hey East Coasters will do that. It was weird to me that they didn't name the origins of the oysters when they were dropped off, but once our regular server came around and we asked he filled us in. Our server was good, but there was quite a lapse in time between courses. We both ordered the lobster bisque and maybe it's that I was just at a restaurant that poured a sauce over my meal and a broth over my hubsand's - but I'm already sick of this thing where the server pours out the soup/sauce/broth at the table. Anyway, the bisque itself was tasty but very rich. Could have used more lobster meat and corn and less rich cream broth, but neither here nor there. My husband ordered steak (8oz filet) and I went with the crab cakes. Both meals were over seasoned. ˜Also, weird to me that a restaurant would brag about their corn fed beef, it's cheaper than grass finished, and less tasty. Anyway, the steak was cooked properly and tasted ok, but was over seasoned. Finished with plain ol' not anything special mashed potatoes and blanched plain green beans. Basically it was what you might expect from a wedding banquet. My crabcakes were ok. Also overseasoned, bound with mayo, and served atop a corn salad and cream sauce. After the bisque I needed a break from the rich and this was not the smartest choice. ˜I'm not one to complain about things being too salty, but this was too salty. We took our carrot cakes to go. I haven't had mine but my husband reports his was ""delicious."" The restauant itself was lovely, service was great, just not interested in going back."
9084,1662,5,1,9/17/2013,"The most amazing food where portions & prices are balanced well. The food was excellent. I highly suggest the jalape?o au gratin potatoes. It was my birthday and so they let me pick any dessert for FREE. The peanut butter pie is insanely delicious, made with Hershey products. The meats are from corn fed animals. Try the ahi tuna tartare for the app. I can't wait to go back!"
9085,1662,5,1,9/16/2013,"My wife and I dined at Ocean Prime last night (Restaurant Week). It was a magnificent experience. The restaurant, formerly Roy's was transformed into a sophisticated, classy environment. The service was impeccable...friendly, informative and efficient without being intrusive. We ordered from the Restaurant Week menu and our three course meals were superb! All portions were full sized and very ample. Unlike some retaurants that reduce the size of their entree portions during Restaurant Week. We will definitely return to this restaurant...sooner than later! It was a real treat!"
9086,1662,5,1,9/15/2013,Love this place. It is classy without the fake posh and circumstance. Fun atmosphere. Food was awesome. Drinks were exceptional. Service was first class. This is our new favorite place.
9087,22,5,1,12/1/2014,"Another Fantastic lunch..This is a ""Must Stop By"" local Italian Restaurant you can't pass up. Plenty of space where you don't feel crowded..and can have an intimate lunch or dinner."
9088,22,5,1,10/2/2014,"great,great,great!!!! bring your favorite wine and have a great meal. lunch or dinner."
9089,22,4,1,4/24/2014,"Ordered from here once -- two pies for take-out. ˜One pepperoni, one sausage. ˜The crust was obviously cold-cured like it's supposed to be (unlike Forte or Frank's Trattoria, which wouldn't know good crust if they tripped over it). ˜Sauce was fresh, cheese was just right. ˜I liked the fact that the pepperoni was sliced in-house and not out of a package. ˜The sausage was nicely sliced - not too thin, not too thick. ˜Overall, it was among the best pizzas in this area. ˜Looking forward to going back and trying something else off the menu. ˜I'm just not really sure why ""Deli"" is part of the name. ˜It's not really a deli. ˜This is a good addition to a crowded market, and I wish them all the best. Update: Since my initial review, ˜we've been back several times. ˜Happy to report that the quality remains high. ˜Glad to have this place in the neighborhood."
9090,22,4,1,4/21/2014,"We ordered in (delivery) for dinner. ˜Large plain pie, meatball parm sub, chicken margarita dinner and veal piccata dinner. ˜Everything was delicious. ˜The pizza was one of if not the best NY style pizzas in the area. ˜My son said it was the best other than Star Tavern in Orange (different style of pizza). ˜Keep in mind, that this was delivery. ˜Pizza always tastes better at the restaurant. ˜The meatball parm sub was excellent. ˜Both entrees were really good; very fresh ingredients. ˜My only complaint would be that the portion sizes of the entrees were a little small (compared to Forte, for instance). ˜Also, the woman who took the order said the entrees came with pasta. ˜However, they came with a small portion of vegetables and some mashed potatoes, as well as a small side salad; this was fine with us, but they should know their own menu a little better. ˜There are seemingly hundreds of pizzarias in a 5 mile radius, but this one is well worth going back to. ˜I'm looking forward to eating in the restaurant and we'll certainly order in again in the future."
9091,23,2,1,12/9/2014,Overpriced. Paid $7 for a small chicken salad sandwich that came with nothing but an under brined pickle.
9092,23,3,1,5/21/2014,"Not many options in the nearby area, found this place via YELP. Food was decent but service was lacking. It took almost 20 minutes to get a chef's salad when there were no customers in line. I assume they were filling to go orders....bathroom was disgusting....not sure I would return."
9093,23,5,1,11/15/2013,"I used to go here all of the time because I was a sales rep! Great food, great service, great people. I loved the specials they offered esp the spinach quiches!! So yummy! Hope to go back soon"
9094,23,3,1,10/25/2013,I've been coming her for the last 3 years for breakfast and lunch. Sandwiches are pretty good and staff is friendly. The only thing that skeeves me out is that there are a million seeds in the bagel display that needs to be cleaned!!. Seeds keep piling up.
9095,23,5,1,8/29/2013,"I recently moved to Carteret and was thrilled to find out that there was a deli like this with exotic freshly made salads in my town. ˜I have had a fig salad with walnuts, dried cranberries, crumbled blue cheese as well as a papaya salad and today I had a mango salad ˜which was absolutely devine. ˜They were all AWESOME! ˜The owner and staff are all super friendly and always greet customers with a smile. ˜My BF also gets sandwiches from here and he also talks about how good they are. ˜I am truly happy to have a deli like this in my town."
9096,23,5,1,8/9/2012,"Popular lunch spot with some unusual items. ˜Of special note are the knishes - the light pastry crust is a marked improvement over more traditional preparations - I would say these are the best knishes anywhere. ˜The stromboli, when available, is oddly named as it has no Italian ingredients, but instead deli meats and cheeses in that same pastry crust - not for dieters, but very delicious. ˜A little more pricey than other restaurants in the area, but large portions and good quality keep the crowds coming back."
9097,25,1,0,4/4/2014,Went to this location on 4/3/14 and placed an order for take out. The chicken wasn't ˜done all the way through. So I actually wasted my money. I will never go to this location again. I love the Popeye in Waterbury CT.
9098,25,4,0,3/25/2012,Great food! Yes better than KFC! Minus 1 star for being slow even on non busy hours and got my order wrong a couple times.
9099,25,4,1,10/17/2014,"Wow Anthony ˜is right on!! ˜This chicken is so damn moist and crisply coated. ˜The buttery topped biscuit melts in your mouth. And the French fries weren't bad either. I will definitely be back here for visit!! ˜That biscuit was moist on the inside with a nice exterior, almost tasted like it had garlic butter on top of it. I tried the beer can chicken special that was going on and you get a very moist chicken breast that is cut funny so it looks like a hand....which made for more crunchy batter. ˜And you can rip the finger like pieces and dip them into your sauce of choice. ˜Chicken had a lemony, rosemary taste to it. Can't wait to try their spicy chicken...."
9100,25,4,1,10/9/2014,"I love Popeye's Chicken, but a lot more expensive than KFC. If I get chicken in-store I'll get my order pretty fast. In the drive -thru I'll have to wait on the side parking for them to bring out my order, fresh of course, but c'mon 10 minutes? The interior is clean looking, floors too. But the tables are not cleaned at regular intervals."
9101,25,5,1,11/26/2013,"My favorite fast food chicken around, but not just for the chicken. The popcorn shrimp and crawfish are always a great treat when they have them. I love that Zatarain's seasoning they use on the chicken. So much flavor. You can never go wrong with the moist and tender chicken strips from Popeyes. Enough said. Quick, cheap and delicious. I'll take it over a burger any day."
9102,25,4,1,9/23/2013,Still the best fast food chicken around. ˜The sides are pretty good too. ˜Location was clean and tidy. ˜Service was a bit lackluster. ˜Overall a decent meal for $6.
9103,25,5,1,11/14/2012,"I always like Popeyes fried chicken better than KFCs. ˜I think there are a couple reasons. ˜ 1) Just the right amount of crispy. 2) The flavoring is less salty and has more zing. 3) Less greasy. In terms of value, you can always find like a 10 or 11 piece for $10 or $11 for either Popeyes or KFC. ˜I like KFC's coleslaw more but Popeyes biscuits more. ˜ Overall: ˜When it comes to fried chicken, this is my personal favorite and I'd choose to eat at Popeyes over KFC like 5:1. ˜There is nothing special about this location but is a safer neighborhood than the other Popeye's location on Albany Ave."
9104,25,3,1,10/23/2012,The food is great. But I always tell them I will not park for my food because I feel if they really are gauranteeing fast service then making me park to ensure their in-store time is low then they are fakes. I always wait for my food at the window no matter how made they get at me. SO DONT LET THEM TRICK YU INTO THINKIBG YUR EATING AT SONIC LOL. WAIT AT THE WINDOW FOR YUR FOOD CUZ IF NOT YUBWILL BE WAITING FOR HALF AN HOUR.
9105,25,5,1,7/3/2012,"When it comes to fast food chicken, I say Popeyes beats its competitor! I was amazed to find that they have an actual kitchen, where I've seen them do the process of fried chicken cooking from scratch. On a hot day, I saw one of the cooks taking a break in the rear of the restaurant. Behind him you saw other cooks cutting and washing the chicken before they fried it. It may be fast food, but this comes close to home cooking. If they take the time to wash, cut and cook the chicken by hand, then it's not that fast! I love the two types of flavors they have for their fries and chicken (mild or spicy), and their biscuits are so yummy, so moist, so flaky. The chicken always seems to be juicy, and the chicken's fried breading is just right. Its crazy because at this location you will find swarms of people, and I men people of all walks of life coming in here to enjoy this tasty food. And the service generally is pretty good! I love me some Popeyes!"
9106,25,4,1,5/20/2012,"Lil' Nicky said it best... Popeye's chicken is (bleep)ing awesome! Once you sink your teeth into the crunchy, salty, fatty, spicy experience that is Popeye's chicken, you will immediately realize just how incomplete your life has been until this point. The horrendous fast food meals of your past will flash before your eyes, haunting your every thought ever after... Popeye's loses points for its sides. Perhaps it's only because the chicken is so damn good, but there's really nothing on the sides menu I crave... even the biscuits are subpar. Also a huge negative: NO healthy options... I mean none. Popeye's is therefore an occasional treat rather than a regular stop when I need a quick meal. For instance, I just took advantage of their special - 2 pieces of chicken and a biscuit for $2.49... 910 calories, and 22 grams of saturated fat (which is almost a day's allowance). Still, this location serves a mean mild or spicy chicken, and does it pretty quick. It's unrepentant crap food for sure, but you'll be in seventh chicken heaven before you know it."
9107,25,3,1,11/21/2011,I usually love Popeyes. ˜But this partcular location is really ran badly. The Chicken consistently comes out greasier and saltier than I ever had down south. The biscuits are dry. Oh and the worst thing ever is they dont offer onion rings. ˜If you dont know about Popeyes onion rings you are missing something great!! The manager said he would get them if he saw a demand. So... ASK FOR THEM!!!! Atleast the beans and rice are the same. Service is pretty bad also. The truth is you really dont have many options for Awesome fried chicken around here. Not all chains are created equally.
9108,25,3,1,6/20/2011,"Better than KFC. That's basically all you need to know. Greasy like good fried chicken should be, but not so much that the breading sloughs off. Pretty much your average fast food joint otherwise. Might've enjoyed it more had I not ended up spending 45 minutes in traffic after I ordered, and if I'd not forgotten my drink in the restaurant. D'oh!"
9109,25,3,1,6/19/2011,I have never dined in at this establishment. I end up getting food from here when I'm in a crunch for food at work and have pretty much no options. I love their Cajun fries. The fries are dirt cheap and portions are huge. I end up filling up on the fries for dinner at times. They always make it to me crispy and crunchy despite being 15 mins plus from my work place. I don't normally order anything besides the fries but my coworker seem to love their chicken. The service at this location sucks. Please check your order before leaving the parking lot. If an item is missing and you attempt to call no one will ever pick up. There is no option to leave a voice message either. Even if you try to call the following day at another time the phone seems to ring but still no answer. I work very hard for my money and I expect to get what I paid for. In my situation missing fries is not a major complaint but it peeves me that I didn't even have a convenient way to voice my concern.
9110,25,3,1,1/13/2011,"I have never eating at this location and never will because it is a dump. ˜I always pick up. ˜The chicken is ok, I do like the crispy and spicy types they are on par with Louisiane Popeye's which I would think is what their goal is. ˜ The sides are below average. ˜I have got chunky mashed, dried out mac and day old rolls. ˜ Still some how I am giving them 3-stars you ask? ˜Well, their chicken really is that good. ˜Sometimes a hit and miss they are hard to figure and even harder to know when they will have their A-quality food."
9111,25,4,1,3/7/2010,"Great fried chicken as you would expect from any Popeye's! ˜Spicy, lightly battered, tender and moist - it hits the spot every time... I knocked it down a star only because they tend to be busy and the service seems slow."
9112,1664,3,0,11/3/2014,"I'm giving this pizzeria 3 stars .... It Could have easily been 5. the pizza is great .... an awesome quality pie for Bayonne .... or even Jersey City. However the staff is completely rude and have an unearned ""cockiness"" as if they know their the best .... as true as it may be the lack of humility is probably the reason why this establishment is so easily forgotten .... ˜i would visit a "" Mikes Pizzeria"" or a ""Wild Wood Fired Pizza"" (only because of how nice the staff is every time i visit .... like im long missed family or something lol) long before i return in person to this establishment only to be talked about out loud and rudely (because i asked if they served Hawaiian pizza) while i try to enjoy a meal with my wife and kid. however i might order anonymously, and send a friend in to grab my pie lol .... it is that damn good!"
9113,1664,5,0,4/6/2013,Amazing pizza. The best in Bayonne. Every other place is kinda overrated.
9114,1664,5,1,12/22/2014,"There are at least 25 pizza restaurants in Bayonne NJ. Many of them create great pies. However, one clearly stands out. Denapoli's Krispy Pizza not only makes incredibly delicious pies their prices will astound you. When you get the bill you will swear that you went back in time to the 1980's Large pies are $9 and there is a special deal for pick up only, of two pies for $15. Everyday you can buy an oversized slice of pizza ˜and a can of soda for only $2.25. But enough with the prices. The pies are not too thin or too thick. They will also make any thickness you may ask for. You will never see a burnt pie and though I usually do not eat the crust of most pizzas the crust at Denapoli's is always crisp and never soggy. Only the best ingredients are used. Homemade dough and sauce with actual pieces of real tomatoes can be found in all of their pizzas ˜You will think you ordered a pie with extra cheese as their is always plenty of fresh Grande mozzarella spread across each pie. Finally, don't forget trying their sandwiches. They are large in size,great in taste and also ridiculously low in price. Go to their restaurant located between 31st and 32nd streets on Broadway in Bayonne. You will never want to go anywhere else. 10 Stars. SM"
9115,1664,4,1,4/6/2014,I always forget that this place exists but they have one really great pizza! Ordered a large pepperoni for pickup. I recommend.
9116,1664,4,1,9/6/2013,Delish pizza from a rude old man! :) ˜ Prices are great. Ignore the grouch and take your pizza to go!
9117,1664,3,1,5/29/2012,"best pizza in bayonne, as far as i'm concerned, but the men working there threw a temper tantrum when we pointed out that the price on the menu for our pizza was less expensive than what they wanted us to pay! when we pointed out that they might want to modify the prices on their menu, they become even more irate and demanded that we leave the premisis immediately. scary folks, indeed, but truly gifted as far as pizza making is concerned! keep your mouths shut, enjoy their food, and pay them what they ask for, and you'll be fine!"
9118,1664,5,1,10/13/2011,This place is awesome. ˜A large pepperoni pie for $11...seriously? ˜You can't find that anywhere....and the pizza is GOOD! ˜MUCH better than any other place I've tried in Bayonne.
9119,1664,2,1,9/8/2011,Who can beat a $1.50 slice? ˜The slice isn't bad and for $.50 more you can get the daily special slice with a drink. ˜Their re-heated crispy slice is way better than if you were to order their whole pie. ˜I'll give them an extra 1/2 star for having fresh mushrooms.
9120,1664,4,1,3/12/2010,"the slices are thin and delicious. i'm partial to the plain, but when i feel like getting crazy i may get a white or a chicken francaise. order some garlic knots 5/$1. ˜go for broke!"
9121,4270,1,0,9/17/2014,"I live up the street from this new location and at first I was delighted to find we have a new Italian specialty sandwich spot in the neighborhood. I've given the place 3 tries and have pretty much been let down each time by both the food and the service. I gave it another shot today and ordered the Godfather. My Godfather hero consisted of regular ham, regular salami, and regular pepperoni. Really?? That can't be right.... I could have gotten this basic meat at Subway. No prosciutto, capicola, mortadella, or sopressata. I don't even think they had these meats on hand which is crazy. The staff/customer service also needs some help if they intend to survive. This location continues to give the John's Deli franchise a bad name and it's sad."
9122,4270,2,0,7/3/2014,"Went here the 1st week they opened this location. The roast beef was overcooked on the dryish side and the hero was a bit stale. Chalked it up to being newly opened having some growing pains The second time I went months later, I skipped the roast beef. The hero was even more stale this time. Nothing in the steam trays was fresh and the service was friendly if not a bit slow. It seems that John's product is suffering at the hand of opening too many locations."
9123,4270,5,0,12/15/2014,"Tastes Just Like I Remember. Great Roast Beef, Monday is a Great Day, Pastrami on Preztel Bread !!! And On Friday We Load Up On Seafood."
9124,4270,3,1,12/19/2014,"Got a roast beef and fresh muzz hero with onions to go and gravy on the side. I will avoid comparisons with the Brooklyn location as I have not been there in many years. For $8.50 the sandwich was a decent size but not huge. Once home I added the gravy and heated it up. The roast beef was fine and of good quality, but there was very little muzz. The gravy and tasty bread helped. Had there been more cheese I would return to get it quite often, but as it is I would only pick it up if I happened to be in the area."
9125,4270,2,1,6/9/2014,"Everyone seems to brag about John's Deli of Brooklyn, but this new location is just not that special. It's an ordinary deli, and the roast beef is alright. It's average. And the reason for cutting another star away is because the service is absolutely terrible. Guys that work there don't even know the difference between pastrami and prosciutto. What kind of Italian deli doesn't know the difference between pastrami and proscuitto? Embarrassing."
9126,27,1,0,11/1/2014,"People that run this place are rude! ˜Went in to ask for take out, which I have done many times before. ˜Stated no take out while another person at the exact same time was walking out with food. ˜Food is ok, but there is better in the area! ˜Try Nutley for your Peruvian fix."
9127,27,1,1,12/18/2014,"THE SERVICE HERE IS HORRIBLE!!! The lady was on the phone when I came in and didn't even acknowledge the fact that I was standing there waiting for her to take my order...I had to abruptly interrupt her personal call just to make my order. Then when my food was ready I give her my card to pay and she tells me the minimum for cards are $20!!! I truly wanted to leave the food there but I'm pregnant and was starving...I pretty much payed (if you include atm/bank fees) $15 for half a chicken! Needless to say I won't be going back! ˜The chicken was just ""ok"", and the fries were drenched in oil...this is the 1st and last time I go this crappy place!!!"
9128,27,4,1,12/14/2014,"This is a small Peruvian restaurant in a strip mall. The smell of the food led me there after Xmas shopping. Steady crowd, not too many tables so it's an eat & run type of setting. Our server didn't speak English but we were able to get exactly what we wanted. Just be mindful that they serve family style portions and the food is delicious."
9129,27,4,1,12/1/2014,"I reallllly want to give them 5 stars simply because of their Pollo a La Brasa. But I can't and here's why... Their Peruvian chicken is as close as authentic as you can get to eating Pollo a La Brasa straight from Peru. Compared to other local Peruvian establishments, hands down the best chicken as far as moisture and flavor. A whole chicken (with a side of fries and small house salad) is $17. Not the cheapest meal but again, it's flavor is worth it. Unfortunately, it stops there as far as praise. There are times they are short on chicken. Not the friendliest of staff or service. I find myself talking to the tops of their heads at times as they don't care to look up and greet you appropriately. Other classic Peruvian dishes on their menu don't compare to the authentic taste they managed to perfect with their chicken. The Pollo a La Brasa solely earns my four star review. Otherwise, this place without it would be a two."
9130,27,5,1,11/1/2014,"For what it is (very casual, authentic food, no frills), this place deserves 5 stars. Staff is very friendly, service is quick and food is delicious. We ordered two trays of the lomo saltado and the papas rellenas. Lomo was delicious and better than some places, and the papas rellenas were good but I've never had them before so don't take my word for it - they were served with pickled red onions. Would definitely return and recommend. A hidden gem as someone else commented."
9131,27,5,1,10/18/2014,Court & I tried this place for the 1st time a few months back. And I gotta say it was worth the stop. Had to make a 2nd trip just to bring it home. Bad thing it's Saturday and they don't open until noon. But I was able to place an order so that it could be ready by 12. That's very convenient & a huge plus for me.
9132,27,4,1,8/25/2014,"Great Peruvian Food & great service! They have $14 dollar TRAYS of lomo saltado (steak, fries and rice with tomatoes & onions). Their rotisserie chicken is also tasty and a great price! They are usually closed on Tuesdays and unlike the one that located in Passaic the staff is much nicer and accommodating. One of my favorite go to restaurants thats a hidden gem."
9133,27,3,1,6/28/2014,"Visiting from south Florida I must say they have the best pollo a la brasa I've tried in the states. The flavor profile it's as close to the Pollo a la brasa in Peru that you're going to get. For this reason alone you should come and get your pollo on. The reason for the 3 stars is the rest of the food. Even though its good it still lacks some of the distinct flavor Peruvian food is know for. We ordered the Jalea familiar which was huge and can feed up to four ppl as your main dish. We were given a mountain of perfectly fried to golden perfection fish, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. On top of your seafood mountain you'll find an onion and tomato mixture which goes perfect with all that fried goodness.I personally would have like this to be seasoned a little more and to be served with lime wedges. We also ordered anticuchos which were served with potato and Peruvian corn. This is were the let down happened. Anticuchos are supposed to be extremely packed with flavor and what we got lacked that quality. They needed to either marinate them longer or vamp up the marinade they use. What seemed to be popular and very inexpensive at only $7.99 was their daily special. You got a huge bowl of chicken soup, the entree for the day was tallarin con pollo, and a salad. 90% of the restaurant ordered this and the portions were big. I would definitely keep coming back for their amazing pollo a la brasa. Also their cash only and no atm in plaza."
9134,27,3,1,4/17/2014,"THE best pollo ala brasa I know in the area and surrounding cities. I do have to stay there were a few times the chicken breast was dry but I love the fries - it's hand cut fresh! Love the sauces especially the mayo! -Peruvian style ! The salad is not the best - :( it's iceberg lettuce and I had better white vinegar dressing at other Peruvian restaurants. Owner definitely needs to improve the dressing. The place is very small with maybe 5 tables and most of the time I call first to see if there is any chicken left because it goes fast! Chicken and fries are their strengths and having none left makes them weak ! They do offer breakfast . I tried it once upon time ago maybe 3 months ago and personally I found the tamale ,the blood sausage and fried pork too dry. Maybe it was my batch . I'll try again and take a pic too!"
9135,28,1,0,9/3/2012,"I don't understand why everyone makes such a big deal about this place. I came here for a late breakfast/early lunch with my girlfriend...WHAT A MISTAKE. You would think that ordering something as simple as pancakes with eggs and bacon and a cheeseburger deluxe would taste fine but NOOOOOO. To start off, my girlfriend's pankcakes were gooey on the inside and burnt on the outside, the eggs were cold and the bacon tasted like cardboard....not to mention that's pretty much what it looked like. I asked for my cheeseburger to be cooked medium, and got something that looked like a piece of charcoal. The lettuce was brown around the edges and the french fries were soggy...they must have been sitting out for too long. I would rather eat at McDonald's. The server was so unfriendly and I felt like I was bothering him when I asked for a refill on my soda, which by they way, he never came by to see if we needed anything else. To top of this terribleeeee expirience, this place is so closterphobic and they don't accept credit cards....ummm, last time i checked the year was 2012. If youre really looking for a good dining expirience try hitting some other place up in the neighborhood because this place blows."
9136,28,1,0,8/13/2011,"Had been looking forward to trying the old fashioned and (apparently) famous Tom's in Prospect Heights. ˜I'll never go back. ˜Here are my thoughts from today, sitting at the bar: 1) Line down the block 2) Flies 3) Zero service throughout 4) All the hype about the pancakes is completely unfounded. On top of that, pun, the syrup is cheap and gross. 5) Had to ask for syrup 6) Had to ask for salt (they brought salt, no pepper.) 7) No coffee re-fill, no water re-fill 8) Asked for eggs over medium, and, ommmm.....they weren't even close. A mess. 9) Unable to order a single pancake and 2 eggs. 10) Did not clear my plates 11) Toast came out when i was done with breakfast 12) Patrons of the restaurant asked me to move down, i did 13) Patrons continually bumped into me, not even close to enough room 14) Staff continually bumped into me 15) Staff arguing with each other Wow. Clearly, this place is riding the high of its hype, and, good for them....they're snared in that sweet spot of great popularity and in NYC that could last for years. But for me, all I'm after is a simple greasy spoon diner. ˜I'd like to experience the opposite of all 15 things above, and it's not too much to ask. ˜These are simple, basic expectations from your average breakfast diner. Coincidentally, the place I have been going regularly for 2 years prior to this is the Tom's on the Upper West Side, and that Tom's I can recommend. ˜ Good luck."
9137,28,1,0,9/5/2010,"My review is biased because I didn't try the food but I did have plenty of time to stand in line and watch everyone eat their meals. I left after waiting in line for breakfast for 15 minutes...This was after standing in line outside for 15 minutes. We squeezed our way into the door to find another line to wait in. After 10 minutes inside watching people leisurely eat - I realized I just could not subject myself to this type of dining experience. I would never feel comfortable eating my breakfast with hungry people standing over me next to my table wishing I would hurry up. The decor further realized the nightmare that was this place. It looks like someone broke into the back room at TJ Max after Xmas and looted everything that was going to be thrown away to finish the macabre haphazard 'interior design' at Tom's. Just because it's ugly doesn't make it 'cute', it makes it 'ugly'. This is what it must feel like to be a chicken at a chicken farm. Except this place seemed a little more inhumane. I'll wait 30 minutes in line for a multimillion dollar rollercoaster experience at a theme park - not for over priced eggs-bendict that is being eyed by a line of twenty drooling hungry people. Who in the hell can stand this place?"
9138,28,2,0,11/3/2014,"Came here early July for breakfast with a family of five based on the reviews. Don't know what all the hype is about. The food was average at best , the waiter messed up the orders , the line for the one toilet is unacceptable for a restaurant with this many covers. Don't bother !"
9139,28,2,0,9/21/2011,"So we decided to have brunch Sunday afternoon, we get to Tom's and we ended up having to wait for a table, I'd say about 45 minutes?? The food wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be, the hostess offered us hot coffee and cookies (stay away from the cookies) once we got our food I was unimpressed by my 3 cheeses omlette that only had american cheese in it was overcooked. Others ordered pancakes & bacon the typical stuff, but the crabcakes w/chipolte mayo were awsome. I won't hurry back anytime soon."
9140,28,2,0,2/13/2011,I honestly don't get what all the fuss is about. ˜This is an average diner at best. ˜Their food is not amazing and in some cases has been pretty bland and it is completely overpriced (I ordered two egg sandwiches and a side of homefries and it cost me $15!). ˜I agree with many of the reviews that their service is warm and very welcoming but the interior is kind of ugly and the fact that there are lines around the block absolutely confounds me... it is really just an average diner and certainly not worth a long wait.
9141,28,2,0,1/4/2010,"They really have delicious food and have lots of stuff for you to choose from but yeah, all the reviews here that says the service kinda sucks is right. I mean, this would have been a perfect review for me but the service really needs to be improved. The staff are sooooo indifferent to customers. They even ignore you and it's so obvious. Whatever."
9142,28,2,0,8/20/2009,"I lived 2 blocks down from Toms and on certain days such as saturdays, the line would be soo long at Toms. I am not from new york and have been living in bk for about 5 years now. I've heard so much about Toms and how great their pancakes and stuff are. Well I was dissappointed. The food i order was bland and home fries was soggy. The pancakes are not that spectacular either. I guess all those fancy butters and syrups they give u make the pancakes better. Anywho, I was dissapointed and prefer Shanes cafe instead."
9143,28,3,0,9/15/2013,"A couple of the pancake dishes are pretty good, especially the Danish pancakes. The other dishes are decidedly not worth the wait on weekend mornings. The fries and oranges on the waiting line are a nice touch."
9144,28,3,0,1/11/2011,I have been to this place several times. ˜The food is pretty good over all I did have a few less that great experiences here however otherwise it would have gotten a higher rating.
9145,28,3,0,1/10/2011,"this place was pretty good. the oranges and cookies in line are a nice touch. I went for sunday afternoon brunch and while the line was kind of long, it moved really quickly. the servers were attentive and everything came fast, but i did have to ask for water three times before i got it, and it still took like 5 minutes after i asked the third guy. my friend got the sweet potato pancakes which were delicious and i got the basic two eggs breakfast which was not super great. The potatoes were still somewhat hard and the eggs were really nothing special. But, this meal was only $4, which does not even exist in california! i would go back but it is a touch overpriced, from what i can tell, for the quality of the food."
9146,28,3,0,3/29/2007,"I like this place. They serve great food (especially breakfast) but I'm always baffled by their hours of operation. I'm never quite sure when they are open, and they never seem to be open when I'm hungry. Usually when I pass by, they are closed. Otherwise, they are open with a long line of people waiting to get in. So, although i do like it, it is very inconvenient. Rumor has it that the popular 90's club hit ""Tom's Diner"", with vocals by Suzanne Vega, was about Tom's Restaurant in Brooklyn, and not another establishment with an identical name in Manhattan."
9147,28,4,0,11/14/2014,My vegetarian friends drag me here every once and a while. ˜It's a good place we can agree on. ˜I love the pancakes and assorted butter. ˜I like the vintage style. ˜Like walking into a old diner.
9148,28,4,0,9/8/2014,"Amazing service and the best lemon ricotta pancakes I've ever had in my life (hint: order them with blueberries). The perfect weekend meal spot, Tom's boasts a classic diner menu, along with some unique and tasty brunch items like Danish pancakes with blueberries, ricotta and parmesan. Sammies are simple and delicious, and fun beverage options like milkshakes or a Cherry-Lime Ricky completes the experience. I don't personally come here for the entr?e items, but hey that's not what a diner is for, right? Service is fast and friendly in general, prices are more than reasonable, and the ambiance is...interesting. There is ALWAYS a line outside on Saturdays and Sundays, but it moves quickly and they treat you to orange slices and French fries with spicy mayo while you wait. These places are good for the social fabric of neighborhoods. The vapid consumerism that turns NYC neighborhoods into retail turnstiles isn't."
9149,28,4,0,6/14/2014,"Breakfast at Tom's. What's not to like? Lots of choices, including the yummiest pancakes. It's the only place I know of in the NYC area that still can do cherry-lime rickeys AND wonderful egg creams. Plus, if you happen to come when they are busy and you have to wait in line, the staff comes around with coffee and cookies for free while you wait!"
9150,28,4,0,4/16/2014,went here today 4/16/14 and everything from the food to the service was wonderful. ˜i had the danish pancakes (parmesan cheese and pancakes?? who knew?) and turkey bacon with a chocolate egg cream and i left full and very happy. ˜the servers were extremely helpful and happy as well. ˜next time around i'll bring the kiddies
9151,28,4,0,3/10/2014,"Went there and was pleasantly surprised after reading some other reviews. Very nice, informal atmosphere, smaller than I expected. Excellent service sitting at the counter. Very friendly counter people. The milk shake ordered for my son was huge and delicious for $5.50, and an extra two glasses were brought over so we could share. Our party ate a variety of food. Some just so-so or bland like the hamburgers and fries, but the BLT wrap, coffee, milk shake and everything else was very good. Prices were not high considering the upscale neighborhood, but Tom's doesn't take credit cards so be sure to bring some extra cash with you."
9152,28,4,0,2/10/2014,"This is such an adorable place to go for breakfast. We went on Sunday and there was a long queue but it didn't feel too much at all especially since we saw happy smiling faces around us, lovely staff trying to accommodate us, free coffee and cookies till we got a seat! Really cute and chirpy place and the food is totally worth the wait! The hot chocolate for 2$ was yumm!! And so were the pan cakes. Must must try!"
9153,28,4,0,6/18/2013,"Crown Heights at its finest, i love love love this spot, and the smell and taste of the beef stew is great !!"
9154,28,4,0,5/23/2013,The Line was long but moved very quckly. I feel like this place is a true piece of new york history. The food was decent. ill be back
9155,28,4,0,4/25/2013,"Me and my my wife went twice since last Sunday and probably will eat there after returned to Peru. We ate eggs and bacon, fluffy pancakes, eggs Benedict and French toasted with banana. Everything was pretty good including the service. Free orange slices and cookies in the line was a very gentle detail."
9156,28,4,0,3/19/2013,"Cozy atmosphere, great brunch food, and best of all is the service. While we were waiting in the formidable line, the owner himself came out twice with fresh-baked pancakes and french fries for all of us people waiting in the cold!"
9157,28,4,0,12/27/2012,"The pancakes were really good. Its fluffy and very light. The flavored butters are excellent condiments for having pancakes. The sausage was fried too well for my liking, it was dry. The Vanilla MILKSHAKE is OUT OF THIS WORLD!! I love desserts and I've been to: Serendipity, Baked by Melissa, Magnolia, Crumbs, Francois Payard Patisserie, Financier pastries, La Maison Du Chocolat, etc. and this milkshake does it for me. The only turn off was the attitude of the waiter taking orders. He needs an attitude check. The elderly lady at the register is a sweetheart! Limited delivery. Cash only!"
9158,28,4,0,12/26/2012,Very nice place! ˜Great Staffs Breakfast was delicious. I will definitely visit again soon
9159,28,4,0,10/5/2012,"Really solid breakfast/brunch joint. Although it gets crowded,they are pretty hospitable. One of the few places I'm sure to take my friends from out of town."
9160,28,4,0,10/4/2012,"Really great food awesome breakfast...I live one block away :) I take away one star though because although the food is good enough, the service sucks. The waiters are very rude. Rude enough to ˜make me not want to go as much. When I went there with my mother the waiter REALLY rushed us... and we weren't even there for five minutes! ˜with all of the yummy things on the menu it takes a couple of minutes to decide, but he wanted us to know ASAP ˜(as if we had somehow magically memorized the menu) and he was very irritated with a nasty attitude (kind of sounded like he was threatening to make us leave ). I understand there was a ˜bit of a crowd ˜and it gets irritating for them sometimes.... but no reason to be an asshole..and it wasn't THAT crowded either....(just saying!!) .... Just because the food is good ˜and Tom's is a well known diner does not mean the employees could ˜use it as an excuse to be rude. It's not like its the drop in and out pizza parlor, It's still an eat in resturaunt ..and the other resturaunts that I have been in that have lines down the block (much longer than Tom's) weren't half as assholish as the people here... I'm guessing not all of the workers act this way but according to these reviews I'm not the only one to experience this.... So yea ""Tom's""..get it together with that...nobody wants to deal with a jerk early in the morning, not ˜waiter nor customer."
9161,28,4,0,2/20/2012,Tom's Restaurant is a great place. The shakes in particular were amazing. The service was great and very friendly. The fries were perfect. I wasn't super impressed with the burger I got though as it was dry. The crab cakes were pretty good. Very friendly.
9162,28,4,0,11/29/2011,their hours are from 7am-4pm not 6am-4pm. ˜I was highly disappointed going there to find that the store hours listed online are wrong. Please update your information. I was looking forward to some sweet potato pancakes this morning and now I had to settle for something else...booooo.S/N there food is amazing :)
9163,28,4,0,7/20/2011,Just awesome.
9164,28,4,0,5/5/2011,"Everything about Tom's is what I want in a diner - a classic menu, old booths, and counter space, stuff littering the walls (in a good way), and UNBELIEVABLE service from all involved. I love the small touches, a cookie or slice of orange if you're waiting outside on a busy weekend brunch service, ˜cool LARGE coffee mugs so you don't have to ask for a refill every 5 minutes, ˜and fries with chipotle mayo! I take off one star because of the eggs. ˜For whatever reason, whenever I've ordered an omlettte or scrambled eggs, they are overdone. ˜When i've ordered sunnys-side-up, they taste great. ˜So think twice before getting an omlette. Even if you do come on a busy weekend, the line moves quickly so be patient."
9165,28,4,0,4/8/2011,"i'm a regular here (at least once a week) and you always know what you're getting. fresh, great, interesting, food...it's not to be missed and the wait staff is amazing"
9166,28,4,0,9/7/2010,Good spot for diner food in Prospect Heights. The sausage was superb.
9167,28,4,0,8/8/2010,"Everyone has said this before, but this place is so welcoming. We got here fairly early (10:45?) on a Sunday, ˜and so only had to wait about 7 minutes, but even so, the waitress came by twice with treats -- an orange slice and small chocolate chip cookie -- while we waited. A friend and I shared the pumpkin walnut pancakes and vegetable omelet with home fries. The omelet had lots of veggies, and the potatoes were not deep fried, like so many home fries, just lightly pan fried, yum. The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I'm not sure I could really taste pumpkin, but still good, especially with the cinnamon butter they gave us (lemon and strawberry too). Other than the lack of pumpkin flavor, my only other minor complaint was that along with old-school price ($0.90) the coffee was old-school bodega quality, not the gourmet kind my spoiled tongue prefers. All in all, a delicious, fun brunch, and definitely a great place to take guests to show off the charms and warmth of the neighborhood."
9168,28,4,0,8/4/2009,"People make a big deal out of this place and, as a result, it's always busy, busy, busy. But if you're craving pancakes on a Sunday morning, and who doesn't every now and then, this place is your ultimate destination. The lemon pancakes are tops, as is the french toast. You really can't go wrong."
9169,28,5,0,11/27/2014,"What a nice homey restaurant. ˜Our family went to celebrate a birthday. ˜My sister has talked about this place for a long time. ˜We came for breakfast and was surprised at the line to get in. ˜But once inside we understood. ˜The cozy atmosphere was truly enjoyable. There were people of all ages and it felt right. ˜The food was delicious. ˜My favorite part of the meal was the rich hot chocolate. Perfect for the cold weather. When I come back to visit, I'll come again. ˜Well worth the wait in line :)"
9170,28,5,0,11/4/2014,"This morning I ordered breakfast from Toms and wasn't disappointed! At first,my initial order was messed up, and the delivery man rang my bell despite instructions not to do so (he woke up my grand parents). One quick call to Toms, resulted in a new delivery, with additional items for my grandparents to make up for the earlier delivery. THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! ( Ham, steak and eggs. YUM!) ˜And the customer service was as sweet as their hot chocolate! Thanks Toms! I'll be ordering again!"
9171,28,5,0,9/17/2014,"Every single last time I've been to Tom's Restaurant, I've been satisfied. I live in the area, and I always make sure to drop in when I get the chance. It is amazing how much food you get for the price! I enjoy the service as well; they have been sweet as cherry pie to me and they never fail to seat me with lightning quickness. They get your food to you in no time flat! I really love how consistently friendly they are. They reassure you that it's okay to take your time, even when the line stretches out the door! I've been on that line, by the way, and they give you coffee, cookies and fresh fruit to snack on. The food is amazing! They make a killer burger, but what I really come for is the pancakes! Apple cinnamon, pumpkin walnut, blueberry and ricotta with lemon zest - the possibilities are endless, and all very yummy! All in all, a lovely experience every last time."
9172,28,5,0,8/3/2014,"The food and service transcended taste and class. I was almost moved to tears (of joy) by the tremendous generosity of the employees. While my friend and I, let's just call them ""Barbara"" for now, were lucky enough to get a seat quickly, others toiled in a long line. But alas, the staff kept on bringing treats! Orange slices, honey toast, fries and even water. A sight to behold, but better experienced than told! Go here or risk losing one of life's greatest joys!"
9173,28,5,0,7/29/2014,this place is so good its been around since I was a child they are so welcome and friendly the food is amazing especially the pancakes I also like to get the grits and cheese great place for kids and family .. 10 stars if you ask me
9174,28,5,0,6/4/2014,"Love Tom's restaurant, best breakfast especially the pancakes!!"
9175,28,5,0,3/5/2014,"The Tom's Restaurant is the outside shot of the ""Seinfeld"" coffee shop. The sign in the outside is exactlu the same as on the show and that's why we went there. We stayed for lunch, The place was packed during a peak lunch hour, but well organized, we only waited couple of minutes before we were seated. The diner keeps it's own identity and features only couple of pictures from Seinfeld on the walls, which was nice to see, that they are not trying to mooch on the show. The food was great and staff was very friendly."
9176,28,5,0,9/15/2013,"A must if you're looking to taste delicious diner food. This is what New York stands for in terms of ""american food"". Just remember, CASH ONLY. No credit, my friends. Just a heads up. You will have to wait in line because this place is always packed, but trust me, well worth it. Mmm. Not to mention they make it go by a little faster by sending a waiter down the line with little ˜""samplers"" like their sausage, or great fries, and even some orange wedges. I was with one other person, and we didn't mind sitting at the counter, so we got to cut all of the line and be seated inside within minutes (it was truly a beautiful VIP-like moment). I got an order of the Danish Pancakes and my friend a Mexican Omelet. While we waited I sipped my coffee out of a legitimate mug, which was a nice touch, and watched the food orders get sent out. So many things I want to try when I come back. Saw something like and Eggs Benedict come out that looked to die for. My pancakes arrived piping hot and so, SO fluffy. Never had fluffier. The blueberries were the perfect touch of sweet and juicy and I detected a hint of lemon zest. The pancakes were served with three little jars of their homemade butter. I couldn't tell what two of them where, but there was definitely a cinnamon one, and maybe a strawberry one. They were all so good though, especially spread out on my pancakes, and I'm not really a butter person. I think that's the most butter I've eaten in one sitting ever. The portion size of the pancakes was enormous. I believe there were 4 stacked up on top of each other, had to have my friend help me out with the last one and I can really put food away usually. They were light, but so filling. My friend's mexican omelet came fresh off the griddle and slathered in what looked like caramelized onions and salsa, sprinkled with cheddar cheese. He said he loved it, and proceeded to scarf it down like no tomorrow. He got the fries with it and those were also great and crunchy but soft inside. None of that hour old stuff. They came with this spicy remoulade to dip, and it had a nice kick to it that we both appreciated. If you don't mind waiting for good food then really, what are you waiting for?"
9177,28,5,0,4/14/2013,"This is the best diner in Brooklyn!!! Although the line is around the corner, Tom comes out & offers fresh sliced oranges, coffee, cookies, toast w/ honey, & fresh strawberries w/ whipped cream. This is while you're waiting on line to get inside! Talk about fantastic customer service! ˜Other businesses could learn from Toms."
9178,28,5,0,2/18/2013,"I recently moved to Crown Heights. Unfortunately in my 3-block radius there are no Delis. One day I dared to venture a few blocks further to Washington St. and found where they are hiding all the foodie goodness :P. Tom's always has a line in front of it in the mornings. But don't be scared. It is only a 5-10 minute wait. And get this, while you're waiting you are served - FREE coffee! - FREE oranges - FREE sausage The staff is very friendly. The prices are very fair (regular diner prices). I went here 3 times so far with my friends, and every time I received the best of service and amazing food. - The french fries have a very interesting texture to them. - Large selection of omelets. - All waffles/pancakes come with 3 types of flavored button (cinammon, strawberry, and I couldn't quite tell what the 3rd one was) The decor is very vintage. The walls are plastered with newspaper articles and famous people's autographs thanking Gus (the owner) for the amazing food and service. The only bad things is they don't accept credit cards (cries that he doesn't get his 3% LivingSocial points). But hey, it's worth it :) Also the bathroom occasionally has a wait"
9179,28,5,0,2/4/2013,Brigitte Grisanti and Family loved this Place!!! The Milkshakes are the bomb!! The food is true diner food.You get your money's worth!!
9180,28,5,0,10/30/2012,"Tom is an affable fellow who kindly handed out goodies to those waiting for a seat on a busy Saturday morning. Oatmeal cookies, French toast, turkey ham, and coffee were all complimentary. Tom personally conversed with me, recommending the French toast. What sage advice! I work in a nursing home, so it was nice to see an elderly gentlemen so active and vibrant, as Tom. What a great experience!"
9181,28,5,0,8/31/2012,Exactly what they claim to be -- a diner. A great diner with terrific diner ambience. ˜Food is great. Portions are large. I've been there twice in three weeks. Should go there more.
9182,28,5,0,8/31/2012,"I recentley moved to the area, but i am NO STRANGER to Tom's! LOVE this place. Definetly has an old vintage, cozy feel. The staff are extremely friendly, and so is Tom. This is a must try and landmark for the prospect park area. :)"
9183,28,5,0,7/11/2012,Ok so after hearing all the stories about Tom diner I had to take a visit . I was by for brunch on a weekday. Not so crowed the waiter was super nice. Thankfully they weren't alot of people because it a bit small. Love my eggs and pan cake was oh so delicious. Definitely a place to visit once. With all the rush story it crazy. Unless you are living in the neighborhood and you can consider to be a regular there. Worth the experience and delicious food
9184,28,5,0,6/25/2012,"Love this place!! Breakfast pretty much from morning til early afternoon ( :( ˜)It can be crowed & a bit of a wait at times, but in the end of it all its worth it."
9185,28,5,0,4/2/2012,I love me some Tom's! Good eats..
9186,28,5,0,8/17/2011,"Theres nothing bad to say about this place. Great food, great staff,and probably the quickest service ever. And Toms has been serving us the same food we traveled to manhattan to get 5-10 years ago. All the other breakfast spots are playing catch-up Toms laid down the blueprint."
9187,28,5,0,7/27/2011,If you want diner food this place is perfect... I'm not a huge fan of the huge line - although i do love the free cookies and sausage - so I always just get it delivered. ˜It's just as good and gets there in like 15 minutes... my favorite is the eggs benedict with the french fries... the fries are some of the best i've ever had and the sauce it comes with is incredible... their coffee is also delicious and staff is super nice...
9188,28,5,0,6/24/2011,"Came here for the first time a few weeks ago and I feel deprived. I feel deprived that I have spent all these years going to some mediocre diners when I could of been coming here. If you are looking for some great diner food then this is it. pancakes were nice and fluffy, not heavy. It seems like everyone here is ordering some type of pancakes. This place was also very crowded when I had arrived. I've seen been back a few times."
9189,28,5,0,4/28/2011,"Ive been coming here since I was 6 years old, its still awesome."
9190,28,5,0,4/12/2011,"I am partial to these types of places. I love diners and diner like places. First off yes there is a line......moves quick and you get served food while your in line! While waiting they gave us an orange slice, a piece of sausage, a cup of coffee, and a sugar cookie. They squezzed some lemon on the sausage and it was very good. Down to business I had the sweet potato pancakes and pork sausage. Never had sweet potato pancakes before.....they were pretty good. Not exactly what I thought they were going to be but tasty none the less. Sausage was great.....good snap to it. My wife had the challah french toast and that was a big hit too. Service was fast. Everyone was friendly. I shall return!"
9191,28,5,0,1/1/2011,"So I went to Toms for the first time yesterday and after being convinced by a friend that my usually impatient self wouldnt mind waiting in a line wrapped around the corner....Well she was right!! Once the waiters began coming out to the line with plates of pumpkin walnut pancakes, mango blueberry pancakes, waffles, frenchfries, fresh fruit, cookies, and hot coffee....the wait seemed all the more worthwhile..I consider myself to be a bit of a comfort food connoisseur and Tom's did NOT dissapoint. Figured out early on though that its all in what you order...however I can't say anything I saw didnt look amazing. Point blank though, you're at an all american eatery famous for brunch and breakfast offerings..so if you want to leave with a HUGE smile on your face like I did, try any of the amazing pancakes that come with deliciously flavored butters, make sure you have crispy bacon, omelettes are amazing, as are the cherry lime rickeys and hot chocolate....oh and go for the french fries in every case!! They are the best I've ever had! All in all Tom's just won themselves yet another LIFELONG customer! The food, atmosphere, service, and decor were just wonderful! Im ready to go back TODAY!"
9192,28,5,0,12/20/2010,"Ok eaters, again I would like to share my eating experience I had during my visit in NYC. This time it is about Toms Restaurant in Brooklyn. We (that includes my sister) had our hotel at 45 street and found this place with the help of Yelp. Checking some reviews we decided to go to this place and try out their breakfast. At first we had trouble to find this place as I was looking for a large sign pointing to the desired location. After walking past it and returning one street away we gave up hope and almost ended up somewhere else before we were pushed into the right direction by a local who knew this place. There is no sign pointing to the location but small letters on the window of the restaurant, so if you are searching this place keep your eyes peeled and examine store windows :D As we entered the restaurant we felt teleported back in time to the 70s. The decoration of the store is so sweet and has truly a unique atmosphere. A small chat later with the manager of this place revealed why this place has no large signs outside the store. This place has not changed since it has opened in order to keep the unique atmosphere of the place enjoyed and valued by regular visitors. We dared to visit on a Sunday but since being early birds we found a very nice place for us without waiting. Lucky us because 10 minutes later the place was jam-packed and there was a line waiting for empty tables. What shall I say about the food, I ordered 2 eggs with fries, beef sausage and toast, my sis picked an omelette with grit (yuck). The food was superb i was tempted to lick clean my plate because it was just so good. Being a huge eater I also ordered pancakes afterwards which were very yummy or as Homer would say hmmmm pancakes.... This was our best breakfast place we discovered during our stay in NYC and on our day of departure we had a final breakfast at Toms Restaurant again trying out different dishes and enjoying the food and service. Regarding service, the staff is nice and attentive, free coffee refills as much as you like, they also offer you small treats for free to tickle your taste buds. On our visit Sunday the manager was frequently showing up and checking on guests and their needs and doing some small talk. Prices are fair and reflects the quality of food and service offered. One thing to mention is that one of the staff removed the coffee mug of my sister without replacing it or asking her if she was done with it, although my sister still wanted to drink some coffee. That made her a bit unhappy but we are sure it was just an unrepeated mistake. Nevertheless I would recommend this place to everybody looking for a great breakfast. If you go on a weekday bring plenty of time with you as waiting might be involved in your visit. Thanks for reading Vic"
9193,28,5,0,12/14/2010,very good food and great staff.. 5 stars.
9194,28,5,0,12/4/2010,"this place is great, as long as you don't go for saturday brunch.. the line is consistently out the door. ˜go on a weekday. ˜love the feel. ˜love the homemade specialities."
9195,28,5,0,7/6/2010,"The lines can be a bit long to bear, but it's worth it. Brunch is always awesome here with my girlfriend every week and we're ALWAYS happy. Speedy and friendly service has always been our exerience here, and I don't plan on changing my weekly brunch routine by going anywhere else. I'm hooked on Tom's!!!"
9196,28,5,0,5/10/2010,"Wow I love this place. The line wraps around the corner but tends to usually go fast especially with the complimentary coffee, cookies, oranges, sausages served on line while you wait. They have the most amazing fluffy pancakes I have ever eaten and with the flavored butters in the mix you will be in heaven. The crunchy spicy french fries are to die for. Cherry lime Rickey's are pretty good. The service and atmosphere of the diner with that old school feel to the place is what really completes this experience. Try the beans with rice and tortilla mexi style breakfast with ham and eggs, oh man...the salsa is spicy though."
9197,28,5,0,1/6/2010,Super good! love this place.... great for after a night out!
9198,28,5,0,11/22/2009,"you are a diner phenomenally. phenomenal diner, that is you. toms. i dream of the blueberry pancakes with fresh cinnamon butter melting in my mouth. i feel the crunch of crispy tortilla in the huevos rancheros in perfect juxtaposition with the broken egg yolk and buttery black beans. feeeeeeeed me! feed me orange quarters in line! serve me delicious, freshly brewed coffee as i wait impatiently to be seated, staring a hole through some poor hipsters french toast. ˜seeeeeerve me in your quaint little atrium. i love you, toms."
9199,28,5,0,11/3/2009,Hands down my fav place in Brooklyn. ˜Awesome pancakes and staff and it's so charming like being at your grandma's. ˜Must go to in NYC.
9200,28,5,0,9/21/2009,"Tom's Restaurant is a gem. the food is to die for, no wonder they have a long line outside their diner. My husband and I would have to wake up early and get there early enough to get seated and have a nice breakfast"
9201,28,5,0,2/10/2009,"I LOVE Tom's. ˜Went there over the summer and it is the BEST brunch place I've ever been to. ˜It was so homey, with the waiters offering all sorts of delicious things, I ended up with a side dish of stuff I picked up while I ate the food I had ordered. ˜I got my coffee while I waited for a seat, and once my boyfriend and I were sat, the owner(I think) came by and told me the seats weren't good enough and that he could do better, and took us out to a patio like area. ˜When I went back a few weeks a go, it was closed, but I think I showed up too late(really late because they do brunch super late and it's awesome). ˜My pancakes were delicious and made with seasonal ingredients."
9202,28,5,0,1/25/2009,Really nice affordable old-style breakfast place. Friendly and diverse crowd too.
9203,28,5,0,11/30/2008,"We were visiting our daughter in Brooklyn, staying at her friends in Tom's neighborhood; when we found good reviews we tried it out the day after T'giving; we got an immediate seat. ˜It was so positive we came back on Sat. with our son, daughter and her fiance. ˜The service was over the top, the coffee great, delivered to us in line along with cookies, sausage, honey toast, fries and orange wedges. ˜My first day pumpkin Belgian waffle was great. ˜Second day's eggs, bacon, toast, coffee were also great. ˜The welcome, quick service, friendly smiles, efficiency all with neighborhood charm were spectacular. ˜And the price was right. We highly recommend it and will go back for sure on another trip to NY."
9204,28,4,1,1/7/2015,"the brunch here is amazing! The omelets, with spinach or mushrooms came with amazing french fries. The pancakes and the omelets are a must. The only problem is only cash, but there is an ATM at the door. The service is nice and fast"
9205,28,4,1,1/5/2015,"Tom's is the go to place when you want to have a great, huge breakfast. Tom's specializes in all things breakfast, but my slant has always been towards their fresh fruit pancakes, delicious bacon and perfect java."
9206,28,1,1,1/4/2015,Don't believe the hype! Brooklyn staple? Doubtful. Food is awful. Service is worst. Cleanliness questionable. Don't eat here.
9207,28,4,1,1/3/2015,Delivery is off every time ...BUT The quality of the food in the restaurant is great ..Best pancakes I have ever had besides mine of course are the Lemon Ricotta pancakes and the banana walnut ones too ..So yummy ..
9208,28,3,1,1/2/2015,"Took my parents here (their first visit to the US, last day of the trip. First of all, there was a line - about a 25 minute wait outside on a cold Wednesday. ˜New Years Eve, but still it was in the middle of the day. ˜By the time we sat down they had started giving other linewaiters sliced orange which I thought was a nice touch. Mum and Dad each got Cheese Omelettes and I got the Eggs Benedict. My Benedict was okay. ˜A little on the cold side and the poached eggs weren't really runny. ˜Mum and Dad both liked their omelettes, but didn't rave about them - I don't suppose you can go too wrong with an omelette, though. ˜We all got home fries, which I thought were a little soggy but that may just be preference. We got a side of sausage (2 sausages, sliced lengthways) which were a little overdone but still pretty good. ˜All beef, I think. We did not get any pancakes which according to my wife was a big mistake on our part, for shame. Service was polite, but suffered because of how busy it was (natural). ˜Coffee was fairly nice and filled once during our meal. Word of warning - if you're driving around here there is parking meters and little other parking opportunities - bring quarters!"
9209,28,4,1,1/1/2015,"My best brunch experience. Reasonably priced food. Great portions. We ordered the fried chicken cutlet sandwich with fries, side of beef sausage, and huevos rancheros. Everything came out piping hot and perfectly cooked. The fries were crunchy on the outside but perfectly moist inside. The potatoes that came in the huevos rancheros were incredibly flavorful and also not dry. This dish was so flavorful it ˜unfortunately made the sandwich underwhelming. ˜Would definitely come again and wait in line again!"
9210,28,2,1,12/29/2014,"We went to check out Tom's Diner because of all of the great reviews and the 4 star rating. I have to tell you, I think that in NY people get caught up in the ""cool trend"" of things and want to follow everyone else rather than take a step back and really evaluate the experience and the food or perhaps after being in NY for so long, people except less than the best just to attempt to fit in. A would not call Tom's a classic diner experience. If anyone has grown up going or working in diners in America and compared it to Tom's, there is no comparison. The only thing that is the same is that there are a few stools and some tables and fountain sodas and a woman at the register at the door to take the money. Beyond that there are no similarities. I would have to say the pancakes are quality and the flavored butter is a great added touch. After that everything goes down hill. The maple syrup is cheap heavily high fructose corn syrup that comes in a industrial huge containers - which we know because they were filling the squeeze containers from the large containers on the counter when we walked in. That was the same thing for the ketchup. ˜In addition, they have warm mayo out on each table in squeeze containers - anyone for some nice warm mayo sitting out all day? We sat down at a booth that was still sticky from the last customers and also there were two empty used milk containers from other people that must have used it for their coffee. ˜The menus were equally nasty and so dirty it was hard to read the words. Our waiter was nice but it was difficult to understand what he was saying with his thick Spanish accent. In addition, we could not read the check as the handwriting was horrific. When we were finished we were waiting for our check for at least 15 minutes and eventually had to find our waiter that was sitting eating his food and ask for our check. After he gave us our food, we never saw him again. As I was attempting to enjoy my tuna melt with some very done fries (the good part was some horseradish dip that was on the side), I noticed that outside of the bathroom right next to me was about 40 rolls of toilet paper stacked up. Nice touch while eating. They have bathroom with one toilet for the entire place and the door is difficult to lock and it is dirty. Prices were not bad - $27 for two people. We won't be returning and we are still in search for a great traditional diner in Brooklyn."
9211,28,4,1,12/26/2014,"This is one of my all time favorite Brooklyn spots. The food is fast and always good. I am a huge fan of the french toast, it is not too overdone and fancied up like the new yuppie places down there. (although i technically am a yuppie i have a natural resentment to fancy breakfast places, maybe this review explains that!) The people are nice and regular, and i hope it is around for years to come!"
9212,28,5,1,12/26/2014,"Tom's is community history, warmth and kindness, should be embraced as such. Hence the five stars. Nothing lasts forever, and, like so many that fell to time and ""progress"", one day it will be gone. Until then, three generations of my family will continue to love every thing about the place. And on top of all those pancakes, french toast, etc, they do a darn good huevos rancheros."
9213,28,5,1,12/20/2014,Always solid and efficient service. It's very much a diner not a fancy place just good food made and run by good people!
9214,28,4,1,12/8/2014,Everything is good especially the sweet potato pancakes (with homemade flavored butter) along with turkey bacon and scrambled eggs. Don't forget the hot chocolate with whipped cream. Oh - the portion sizes are plenty so bring a big appetite
9215,28,4,1,12/7/2014,"This cash only breakfast/brunch diner certainly takes the award for best customer service. This might be one of the only venues that feeds their guests while they patiently wait for their tables. Kind hearted staff memebers would come around and feed the hungry with crispy french fries, sausages, orange wedges, and sometimes cookies! This may be necessary though as the lines are consistently long due to their loyal following of Brooklynites looking for a hearty meal to kick-start their day."
9216,28,4,1,12/5/2014,"I came here twice with my friends and really enjoyed my times here. The food is fantastic! The wait can be a tad bothersome as it can get pretty crowded but nonetheless the wait is worth it once you get the food. I had the eggs Benedict the first time I came here and then got the lemon pancakes which I had been dying to try. Both dishes were amazing. The lemon pancakes are large and they give you three. I had to take mine home because there's no way I could finish them. I got a side of bacon of course because bacon is why I eat breakfast. If you tell them your preference for the bacon, crispy or soft, they'll make it to your liking which I love! Parking in this area is difficult but not impossible. Tom's is located towards the end of the block and can be passed easily if it's your first time, so keep your eyes peeled. I can't wait to come back here and try their other food. Reasonably priced delicious meals and good service are what you'll get at Tom's! Make an effort to come here at least once!"
9217,28,5,1,11/30/2014,Crab Cakes florentine with spicy sauce and French fires as your side. Chocolate pancakes. Blow your mind. Everything is amazing.
9218,28,5,1,11/30/2014,"Not only was the food delicious, but the people working there were super nice and understanding of the brunch time rush of customers. They give free coffee, fries, and oranges as snacks to keep people on the line and the food usually comes out quite quickly. We ordered: - huevos rancheros - not the fanciest looking, but filled with flavor. I loved adding the spicy mayo on top and mixing it all together. For some reason reminded me of Sophie's. - bacon on a Danish pancake - freaking sweet and fluffy. I'm not one who normally eats sweets for breakfast, but this was just so good. Remember to bring cash and expect a long line for regular rush hour weekends. I'd definitely come here if you're near the Brooklyn museum and botanical garden. They have a weird exhibit on high heels right now."
9219,28,4,1,11/29/2014,"We were in the mood for an authentic diner and we chose right with Tom's. The atmosphere and decor was perfect - christmas decorations are already up so it felt quite festive and the walls are covered in interesting pictures and newspaper clippings. We were lucky and were seated right away on a Friday at noon but by 1 pm the line was out the door! The service was fast and friendly. There were so many great options on the menu that it was hard to choose but at my table we went with the Mexican omelette, veggie omelette, two eggs with sausage and crab cake florentine. And we sipped on a delicious egg cream! Everything was great, although the florentine was extremely rich...the crab cakes themselves were awesome and so was the spinach mixture underneath but the hollandaise sauce was cold and thick. I didn't love that part and I left feeling like I needed to run a marathon afterward. Next time I'd like to try some of their famous pancakes!"
9220,28,4,1,11/28/2014,"At 7am before a doctor 's appointment, I stopped in for breakfast. I figured a should indulge myself on the most important meal of the day. Tom's is a solid breakfast spot with a great selection of omelettes, ˜pancakes, waffles and other breakfast staples. It's a small space with about 10-15 tables and a counter to sit at. I ordered the vegetarian omelette, side of bacon and French fries. The omelette was good, nothing special, but tasty and quick. The French fries were very good, crispy and well seasoned. They are probably a better choice than home fries. Because I was a bit pressed for time I didn't order the pancakes, and I actually regret not doing that. They had tons of options that all looked delicious. Guess I know where I'm going back to the next time I have a craving for pancakes."
9221,28,4,1,11/25/2014,"I order from here A-LOT! I love their food! The service could be a little better though. That is why I took one star off. They don't seem to be properly staffed here so when it gets crowded, the employees seem to channel their frustration at the people that come there whether they are nice or not. But onto the food which is the most important, pretty darn good! I can't complain. I love their pancakes. They are seriously phenomenal! Their omelettes...eh! Not too impressed but that banana walnut pancake! WHOA! HOLD ONTO YOUR HATS PALS! I love pancakes with all my heart so finding this bad boy was a dream come true. The bananas aren't all soft and mushy like some places I have gone and the almonds are nicely hidden within the pancake. They are super heavy so be careful ordering too many sides with these. We have gotten fresh fruit on the side and that seems to do the job. THEY ONLY TAKE CASH SO BE MINDFUL OF THAT! And if you plan to dine in, I never do, be prepared to wait if you're going for an early breakfast. The wait is usually around the corner when I come around like 11 or 12 so I can only imagine what it is like around early bird hours...8-9ish."
9222,28,5,1,11/22/2014,"Lemon Ricotta pancakes were to die for! ˜Had so much food. ˜Friendly staff, pretty gooooooodd"
9223,28,2,1,11/11/2014,"Fast food to table 20min. Undercooked eggs -runny egg whites! in both sunny up and over easy. crab cakes w tasty spicy sauce. Fresh from scratch waffles and pancakes topped (for extra money) w strawberries drenched in sugar syrup. Flavored butters. Over buttered toast. Perfect grits. chocolate water/milk. Box juices. Inattentive servers that seem to be overwhelmed to do standard server duty, I.e. Check-in, clear dirty/empty plates, bring receipt in timely manner. For the wrap-around-the-building lines for all-day breakfast from this neighborhood diner I expected more. Perhaps the standard used to be higher. I won't be back to see."
9224,28,4,1,11/10/2014,"This place is super close to Prospect Park, and in my opinion, it's the best place to get standard breakfast fare. Its not the ghetto, as other reviews have mentioned, but it still is worth the line. They have awesome customer service, and I'm glad to know about this gem. Get the pancakes, or if you're boring like me, eggs and bacon and grits."
9225,28,4,1,11/9/2014,"Very good cheeseburger, fries are great and I like the place!!"
9226,28,4,1,11/6/2014,"Sorry to hear of gus passing, I love this place, I love being greeted in such a nice and comforting way, me and my boyfriend made this place our official go to place for breakfast each year on our Bday"
7784,28,5,1,11/5/2014,"Such an awesome neighborhood joint. Hubby and I recently moved into the neighborhood and noticed the lines that formed outside this restaurant every weekend. We made a mental note to check it out, and came together on a rainy weekday morning for brunch. Love the cozy, old school diner feel. I have a feeling that the Christmas decorations that were up are probably there all year round, haha. Hubby ordered one of the breakfast combos that came with 2 eggs, 2 sausages (SO GOOD), and 2 pancakes. He subbed in some of their blueberry ricotta pancakes instead of the plain for an additional $1.50 charge. Totally worth it. I also liked the fresh whipped butters they came with - strawberry and pumpkin! I had the corned beef hash, which was exactly how my dad used to make it for me when I was little. Came with 2 eggs and toast. Not sure if it was a slow day or if it's typical of them, but they came around to our table and a few others to give us some complimentary soda fountain drinks on the house! We had the cherry lime soda! We had enough food to take home leftovers and the total bill was only $22! Amazing."
9227,28,4,1,10/31/2014,"Their butters are to die for. I have had pumpkin pancakes, as well as a few others and they never disappoint. The lines and wait can be a bit on the long side (at least 30 minutes) but it goes by quick and is worth the wait. Only down side is they do not have brunch drinks BUT this place is a good breakfast classic."
9228,28,4,1,10/29/2014,"Tom's is like a time warp. Before you even get on line (there's usually a line), you'll see the old signage and bric-a-brac. There's so much of it, that from the outside it's almost uninviting...but rest easy, that's not the case at all. That should become apparent as soon as someone comes out to bring you a snack while you wait. In my case it was a cookie drizzled with chocolate and whipped cream. See? Super inviting. The line moved rather quickly too, although I wouldn't recommend large groups. Once you get inside, it's a cozy diner. It's more like the railcar diners than it is a gaudy neon one. You can sit inside the main room of the diner, or along a covered area that is just outside, but protected from the elements. My friend and I ended up out there, right next to all the flavored butter. We were also next to where they put the dishes, but honestly it wasn't a distraction. I ended up getting sweet potato pancakes, and I was not disappointed. The pancakes were not overly thick or dense, and they had pretty generous pieces of sweet potato baked in. I got mine with turkey sausage, and well, the sausage wasn't really my favorite thing. Kinda tough, not too tasty. Everything else more than made up for it, though. It was just the right kind of fall breakfast: a little different, filling, and simple. There's no reason not to go here, regardless of the season. Tom's, you're alright."
9229,28,5,1,10/22/2014,"There is a reason why this place is always busy, wanted to see what the hype was about so I set out to look for a good pancake. Then I found this place and already came back multiple times after The pancakes are nice and light and they have a good variety to choose from eggs are cooked perfectly and the give you a nice sample of compound butter. The place is really tight but cozy feel. Decor is...interesting. Staff is friendly. But get ready to wait in line for awhile though as they can get long. Would recommend to anyone."
9230,28,4,1,10/21/2014,"Oh my goodness. I think I've done it. I think I've tried every pancake variant on the Tom's menu. All delicious. All worth devouring. But my favorite so far? The sweet potato pancakes. Not too sweet, so fluffy, so moist, lightly cinnamon-y. The best thing about all of it is the compound butters they serve with all the pancakes. Errrrmerrrzerrrng! P.S. The pork sausage are chubby little fried fingers of goodness. Ahhh yes moar plz. Pps - if you're on the chubby side like me the booths are a little tiny, unless you like cuddling with your meal partner. Oh oh oh! I totally forgot about the egg cream!! So delicious! The best I've ever had and I'm a brooklyn native!"
9231,28,4,1,10/13/2014,"Tom's gets packed like no one's business. Something about the pancakes. The brunch here is cheap - avoid the scrambled eggs, they over fry them. The lines are long but the waiters are friendly. Tom's - an institution of brunchery!"
9232,28,3,1,9/28/2014,"Meh, another old diner in Brooklyn. Pancakes were good, but not worth going to the ghetto for. It was too hot inside, coffee was terrible, but I can see why some people like it. Reminds me of a Grandma's kitchen. Not really my style, especially not when I'm on vacay and want to eat only the best of the best."
9233,28,5,1,9/28/2014,"This place is fantastic. Not only do they have the greatest selection of food, but the food is so good I could come every day. Also, the people who run the place are the nicest people I have ever met. They really know how and care about their patrons. Must go to for brunch!"
9234,28,3,1,9/27/2014,Went there with the wifey to have some breakfast. This place is a really old NY diner. Wish I would have known that before. Don't get me wrong places like this are legendary but was not in the mood for diner food. We both had different kinds of pancakes both equally as good. But I don't think I would go there again. Just not my style!!!! Plus I found a hair on my plate which killed my appetite.
9235,28,3,1,9/27/2014,"Came here twice for breakfast. Both times were mediocre. First time I ordered the 2 eggs with bacon. The eggs were bland and my bacon was undercooked so it was chewy. Second time I ordered their veggie omelet. It was overcooked as hell. Ever see a brown omelet?! ˜Also it was flat and soggy. Visited this place because it's a landmark but other than the atmosphere and great service, ˜the food is mainly forgettable."
9236,28,5,1,9/27/2014,"We habe been there four times during our nine days NY visit. If you are looking for a original American Diner Tom's is absolutley the best choice. The food tastes delicious (especially The french fries), there is coffee unlimited and you can be sure that you will be full and happy when you leave. ;-)"
9237,28,4,1,9/26/2014,"I LOVED this place. My dad was in town and I needed a place to take a guy with a big appetite. Do not expect to bring a party bigger than 5 people because you will wait cramped in the restaurant and you won't get seated anytime sooner. However they hand out orange slices which is cute and pleasant. This is basic diner food, no frills and in-and-out service. This is great for a pancake lover as they have a million options. I had the pumpkin which were good but my room mate got the ricotta lemon one...and I wish I would've got those! Come early...if not, expect to wait. So don't come too hungry!"
9238,28,3,1,9/25/2014,"Came once for weekend brunch and the line must have helped the hype, but today's weekday brunch was mediocre. We were immediately seated in the back room at half of a 4 person table. ˜Service was a bit slow from start to bringing the check. ˜Coffee came without milk and food with no lovin'. ˜My eggs were in the stage right before you scramble them but over done, turkey bacon was burnt and then piled on top of my lemon ricotta pancakes? ˜Hubby got the pumpkin walnut pancakes which were soggy. ˜Mine were fluffy. ˜Side of grits with cheese was just a slice of american cheese semi melted on top. ˜(I spent 4 years in NC, I know what cheese grits are supposed to be like). ˜Challah french toast was 5 sad looking slices, but tasted good. We weren't told what the homemade butters were but they were nice to have. I know its a diner but don't they have a reputation to maintain?"
9239,28,5,1,9/23/2014,"I'm mad at myself for not trying this place earlier being that it's so close to home. You can tell the place has some history with its 70's/80's decor. The staff is very courteous and a man who seemed like the owner or manager pleasantly greeted us on our way in. As for the food, I had the Danish pancakes with eggs. The pancakes were huge, well prepared and delicious. The price was decent. I have nothing bad to say about this place and definitely will be coming back more often."
9240,28,4,1,9/22/2014,Stop everything you are doing and walk - no run - to Tom's and eat a million of their pumpkin walnut pancakes. Top them with their homemade cinnamon sugar compound butter and maple syrup (I think it's the fake stuff but who cares!) and you will be in carbohydrate heaven. Thank me when you happily emerge from your food coccoon as a beautiful pumpkin walnut butterfly! (PS: Cash only!)
9241,28,4,1,9/18/2014,Come early or you will be waiting in a line that reaches to the outside for breakfast. My food was fresh and delish. I am not really a fan of diners but I enjoyed my experience here.
9242,28,5,1,9/15/2014,"Tom's is a GEM in BK. Each experience was great.I never got to wait on the infamous line for Tom's until my last visit but I had no complains when I did. They brought coffee, cookies, and fruit to snack on while waiting. Who doesn't like to be treated to snacks while waiting on a line. Tom's know there way to our hearts and thats why there is no complaints for lines. The food is always good, pancakes, waffles, and my goodness the cholesterol filled french fries are HEAVENLY, milkshakes are also good (got treated to complimentary milkshakes and cherry lime ricky on more than one occasion), and sandwiches are good. Huge portions for AWESOME prices, my partner and I never pay more than $40 for the two of us, including complete breakfast and drinks. ˜ My only thing I don't like is the CASH only policy but they are still 5 stars with it. In the prospect park area, stop by and try it. You can thank me later."
9243,28,2,1,9/14/2014,Iconic place but they probably have slipped their standards in recent years. Got served a stone cold omelet for breakfast.
9244,28,5,1,9/14/2014,"How is it possible that I've lived in NYC eight years and only just learned about Tom's? I've been wasting my time with every other diner I've ever gone to. Tom's is not an artisanal cocktail, bottomless mimosa boozy party brunch. It's a place to get perfect pancakes and enormous omelettes, with piping hot coffee. I'm wowed by the friendly service on a crazy busy Saturday, by the treats they kept sharing with people waiting in line and that they never tried to hurry us out, even with lots of other people waiting. Oh, and by the flavored butters for pancakes and the mountain of whipped cream on the hot chocolate. This is my new go-to diner, and I'm just sorry I didn't let Yelp guide me there sooner."
9245,28,4,1,9/14/2014,"I love this place. Do not be intimidated by the line because they make sure you have small bites to eat before you enter. One morning I had small portions of bread,sausage, a cookie and orange juice all before I entered the place. ˜ ˜ The only complaint is that the place is very tight so be prepared to get an earful of someone else's convo while waiting for your food."
9246,28,5,1,9/12/2014,"They have homemade butter to go with their pancakes strawberry,pumpkin, & cinnamon the cinnamon one was amazing over the pancakes it remind me of Roscoe chicken & Waffle."
9247,28,5,1,9/6/2014,I love that this place is a block and a half away from my house. It's a blessing and a curse. They have the best pancakes in all of Brooklyn. Who would think that ricotta in a pancake would be sooooo delicious. The French fries are probably one of the most amazing things on the menu. I also love all of the flavored butters they give you for your pancakes. This place is my favorite place ever. PS they also deliver. Worst thing ever!!! But the best.
9248,28,4,1,9/4/2014,"This diner is fantastic. It's been in operation since the 1930s, and the hand-painted signs, the beautiful tile flooring, and the unpretentious yet welcoming ambiance make that fact immediately apparent. My girlfriend and I were seated promptly on a weekday morning although nearly all of the booths were full. Our server was expedient, courteous, and jovial. He immediately offered us coffee and brought us glasses of water. As others have noted, this is a cash-only establishment (as is to be expected in New York). I opted for a bacon and cheese omelette; it was served with a hearty portion of homefries (one can also choose from grits or regular fries, too), along with two pieces of toast--replete with grape jam. Our bill came to less than $25, and I look forward to coming back again for another excellent, quintessential diner-style breakfast. Tom's isn't the best diner in the world, but it's a modestly-priced gem with good food and great service. A beautiful greasy spoon, indeed. I highly recommend having a meal here if you are in the area."
9249,28,5,1,9/1/2014,This place is AMAZEBALLS! ! THE kitchen closes at 9pm we got there at 8:30 and they were still accommodating. The Waffles were good and came with 3 types of special butter. TOO GOOD! ! m My sister had a Ceaser chicken wrap. It was so juicy. ˜Also had the famous cherry lime Rickey and chocolate egg creme. ˜Make sure you put this on your bucket list.
9250,28,5,1,8/31/2014,"This is not the Tom's Diner who's iconic facade was used in the NBC t.v. series ""Seinfeld,"" nor the subject of Suzanne Vega's eponymous hit single ""Tom's Diner"" (which refers to the same establishment featured in ""Seinfeld""). This is a good ol' fashioned neighborhood staple in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. The long lines of convivial Brooklynites all too happy to wait for a table at this gem and the establishment's congenial response to such popularity, serving pro bono coffee to those waiting, tell the story of everything from the food to the spirit of this place. Standard breakfast items are made to perfection with all fresh ingredients and, though quite busy, the kitchen and waitstaff animate at hyper speed in a splendid choreography that bring you your orders in a timely manner."
9251,28,5,1,8/28/2014,"Best diner I've ever been to. The food is scrumptious, fresh, and made quickly. I've had the Danish pancakes, which were a little dry, but the pumpkin walnut pancakes are definitely the way to go. The homemade cinnamon butter is to die for, and the omelets are perfectly thin, just as I prefer them to be. Toast comes pre buttered (!) with jelly which is okay. I love this waiters here, they are no-nonsense types who have friendly vibes! Mexican tunes pipe through the air sometimes, which I dig! All this and the food is so affordable! Go to there...."
9252,28,5,1,8/25/2014,"CASH ONLY. BUT- Great turnaround, the wait isn't long, the service is fantasitc, and the food was perfect. Nothing fancy, but just well-done pancakes (Danish), home fries ˜(get the hot sauce to put on 'em), and french toast which pair wonderfully with the home-made flavored butter. Sometimes all it takes for 5 stars is to deliver perfectly on a simple premise. Good food, served quickly with good service, at a great price. Done."
9253,28,5,1,8/21/2014,Always loved this place...the decor is filled with memorabilia from past to present. The crab cake florentine is to die for. I always have a great experience when I'm here
9254,28,4,1,8/19/2014,"I love the pancakes but I hate the wait, ppl are nice and it's a good place to go with family members."
9255,28,3,1,8/19/2014,"We've tried eating brunch twice w our impatient 5 year old. The third time 11:30 weekday we got in more easily. I've decided Americans line to wait in lines and like a lot of sugary flavors. Chocolate French toast? ˜Not my thing. Flavored butter? ˜My omelette ˜was fine and potatoes were dry, sat in the warmer too long. Live and learn."
9256,28,4,1,8/19/2014,The pancakes!! ˜Their selection is absolutely amazing. All the food arrives promptly and you're seated relatively quickly. The only downside is that it is cash only. It's also extremely noisy but that's due to the young customer crowd and is no fault of the restaurant.
9257,28,5,1,8/17/2014,"CASH ONLY! Came here Sunday morning around 1030am for brunch. There was a short line. We were at the entrance of the door. As soon as we got there someone offered us water so that was cool. A few minutes later they offered us cookies. Then a few minutes after that, someone came around offering fries to try. Omg the fries are so amazing so I had to order it with whatever I was going to order. We didn't wait long for a table but it was only a part of 2. I had the Mexican omelet with French fries instead of home fries. The omelet was OK. The fries were so good. One of the best I've had. The sauce it comes with is really good too but not for you if you can't take spicy. ˜ My boyfriend has the 2 by 2 by 2. The pancakes were regular pancakes. Nothing special. We also got the cherry rickey? drink, not bad, tastes like cherry soda. I tried the different butters that everyone talked about in the other reviews but I didn't really like it. It' very different but cool, just not my kind of taste. There are a lot of workers so service is pretty quick. Although the can be very long, it moves by quickly. I like it here and would definitely come back. ˜On the way out, I saw a sign for their other location in coney island so might give that a try"
9258,28,5,1,8/17/2014,"Found Tom's just by searching for pancakes. I must say. AMAZING. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes but got to taste the broccoli cheese and veggie omelette. They gave us 3 different flavored butters to try: cinnamon, pumpkin, and strawberry. My favorite was pumpkin. What made this experience so much better was the staff. Top notch, incredibly friendly, attentive and helpful. I will definitely come back and I highly recommend Tom's."
9259,28,5,1,8/16/2014,The food is amazing on point cool resturant and spot for breakfast lunch and dinner yummy
9260,28,5,1,8/16/2014,Oh yes my kind of place! We got in an sat down right away. They service breakfast all day!!!!!!!!!! ˜I've had grits and eggs and cornbeef
9261,28,5,1,8/14/2014,"First of all, you have to try their homemade butter! As good as it gets!! I tried the cinnamon and the pumpkin and both were absolutely to die for! I got the pancakes based off a former recommendation and I was definitely not let down (especially coupled with the homemade butter)! The bacon and eggs were great, too but after tasting all of them, I was especially impressed with the pancakes! Also, the coffee was delicious as well! The place is small and sort of crowded, but it fits the restaurant itself. There are so many things to look at on the walls and it got voted the greenest storefront in 2009 and 2004 (I think those were the years at least). I'm not from here so I loved watching all the people and the noise going through the restaurant! You will not be disappointed going to Tom's, promise!"
9262,28,3,1,8/13/2014,Just moved to Brooklyn a couple weeks ago. Great food ..Breakfast or Lunch ..served to order.
9263,28,5,1,8/12/2014,Easily the best diner I've ever been to. Absolutely delicious. Fries are magical. We had crab cakes florentine and blue cheese burger. Unbelievably good!!!!!!
9264,28,4,1,8/11/2014,"Had the cinnamon pancakes, with Bacon. Very very good food, not the best but very fulfilling. ˜The butters are amazing."
9265,28,5,1,8/9/2014,Excellent place. I go every weekend with my girlfriend for brunch. The quality and amount of food is unbelievable and the waiters are really nice.
9266,28,5,1,8/3/2014,"My girlfriend and I initially found this place after having an argument outside about where to go eat. There was no line when we were there, but that seemed insignificant compared to Tom's strange decor. after letting the strange homey/diner feel sink in, we ordered food and completely forgot about the decor and the initial argument. It was that good. MMMM pastrami & eggs & pancakes. We will be back."
9267,28,5,1,7/29/2014,"This place is tiny, but SO worth it. The food was absolutely wonderful...three different toppings (plus syrup) came with the divine Sweet Potato Pancakes. My sweetie and I shared and there was no issue made of it. Not to mention the service...it was totally on point. I felt like a princess. We'll DEFINITELY be back."
9268,28,4,1,7/27/2014,The pancakes are really good especially the Lemon Zest one. They are fluffy and exactly right. The egg Benedict however was a let down due to low quality of the ham. I would recommend this place any time.
9269,28,5,1,7/27/2014,"Get there before 11. The line can be part of the experience, with coffee, cookies, fruit, pancake bites served, but it's still better to get seated right away. Classic diner covered with a layer of quirky, kitschy art/decoration. They manage to make their daily couple hundred customers feel like regulars. ˜Everything is good. The 2x2x2 is my regular order. Flavored butter tastes great on anything. Get the pancakes. Get the egg cream. The waitstaff navigates the cramped seating with smiles and grace."
9270,28,3,1,7/27/2014,"Thursday at 11 am -- about a 10 minute wait in a cramped line. The bonus? We got to peep what other people were eating and a waiter came by with some orange slices while we waited. Once seated, the hubs and I got some mediocre coffees. I ordered the much-talked-about Dutch pancakes (lemon, ricotta, and blueberries), our daughter ordered chocolate chip pancakes, and the husband ordered huevos rancheros on our server's suggestion. We also ordered a side of bacon and cheese grits (you know, health foods) to round out our indulgent meal. In the end, we had an ungodly amount of food. The pancakes are thick and dense (I usually prefer a thinner batter). There was little difference between the Dutch pancakes and the chocolate chip -- I could detect a slight lemony flavor, but the ricotta didn't seem to do anything for the taste or consistency. The flavored butters that came with the pancakes were interesting, but only alright tasting to me, and syrup was regular diner fare. Same goes for the huevos rancheros and sides -- all were pretty typical diner food. Nothing bad, but definitely nothing special. Our bill came to $44 -- reasonable for the amount of food we ordered. Service was excellent. Attentive, friendly, and helpful. All in all, I don't think we'll return to Tom's. There are plenty of places to get similar food, and I can cook a better, cheaper breakfast at home."
9271,28,4,1,7/27/2014,"Love the food, environment and staff! I definitely enjoyed the service. I would love it if the venue was larger but that adds to the ambience. ˜Doesn't accept credit cards..:("
9272,28,4,1,7/20/2014,"I think the hype is kind of undeserved but my friend did most of the heavy lifting (waiting) and my mexican omelet tasted good enough. Still for a somewhat better than average greasy spoon, the votives on yelp seem misplaced."
9273,28,5,1,7/20/2014,"Absolutely one of my favorite. That's THE place I take all the friends who come visit me (and the only place they want to go back before leaving and remember when they come back). Their pancakes are simply the best. They come by 3 and are huge (I can never eat more than one or two) and are stuffed with fruits and nuts, so yummy... It's very cheap, I like the kitsch atmosphere and the waiters always are very nice. It gets pretty popular on weekend but the line moves quickly and you never actually wait more than 20min (plus there is a waiter feeding everyone with cookies, french fries, pancakes or oranges and even giving glasses of water). The menu is diverse, maybe 10 different pancake choices plus every regular breakfast/brunch item. I even sometimes wake up early to get breakfast there with my friends before work!"
9274,28,4,1,7/14/2014,This is a little gem of a diner near Prospect Park. ˜Quite busy but we quickly got a table. ˜I had the pancakes....pure heaven...accompanied by all those delicious flavored butters. ˜It was a nice touch.
9275,28,5,1,7/13/2014,"Walking in, my girlfriend and I were petrified looking at the line of people that literally filled up the Diner in the middle as you walk in for a lunch date. We quickly decided we were going to stick it out and wait. Just then a man working with the restaurant went down the line of people waiting offering fresh cut and very cold orange wedges while we waited (it was so hot outside). Then he walked down a few moments later collected the peels. Then he walked down offering fresh french fries with homemade hollandaise sauce for dipping. It was a really nice gesture to offer a taste of the food while you wait. Certainly it kept the people waiting to hold out! (as we did!) We waited maybe 10 minutes, continually moving so people could maneuver in and out of the door (that's how crowded it was). Then about 6 groups of people were promptly seated on their side room in addition to us being seated. All of the waiters are quick to fill water glasses and they all work jointly in bringing food, refilling drinks, taking orders, cleaning tables, etc. It's a nice family operated jointness. It was refreshing to see (even if all the employees weren't family -- it was clear they were a team). My girlfriend ordered a Coke Float and I ordered the Famous Cherry Lime Ricky. This was AMAZING -- and the food we ordered was equally delicious. We both ordered the Veggie Burger and I ordered the sweet potato fries while she ordered the regular fries. The sweet potato fries didn't crisp up but the flavor was delicious. The regular fries are to DIE FOR -- crispy beyond belief and incredible. The service was fast and good. The tables are close to eachother so you can certainly hear other people's conversations but it's New York -- no one is listening! :) Also, note that they only do CASH at this Diner -- No credit cards. So be sure to have the cash handy! I just love the vintage feel of this place. Brings me back as if I'm in the movie ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" -- hilarious and probably why I liked it (along with the food) so much!"
9276,28,5,1,7/10/2014,Who else serves you cups of coffee and gingers snaps while you're waiting in line on the weekends? ˜Nobody! ˜That's who. 15 years of happy meals with friends at Toms and counting. Don't change!!!
9277,28,5,1,7/9/2014,"Tom's is the best. The food is no-frills, but it gets the job done. It's important to know what to order here...as a baseline, the simpler the better. Corned. Beef Hash is canned, Mexican Chipotle Omelette as weird as it sounds, but eggs are eggs and bacon is bacon, right? What Tom's is really about is the experience. Come and drink coffee while you wait in line, talk to Tom, be waited on by super nice waiters who fill your water and coffee continuously. It's a great time!"
9278,28,5,1,7/9/2014,"Went here for brunch on a busy summer Saturday morning... and received possibly the best service I've ever experienced in a restaurant. I don't care if the owners real name is actually Tom or if it's just a gimmick, but he knows how to treat his customers! First, we've all experienced the weekend-brunch, line-out-the-door. Well, Tom himself walks outside to greet you and give you complimentary coffee. He then tells us that we can get free home fries added to our order. After we ordered our food, Tom walks around to all the tables offering a slice of cinnamon-butter, honey toast. Shortly after that, he walks around handing out cookies with whipped cream on them! The seating is cramped and the decor is outdated, but it's all part of the home-y charm. They make you feel like you're part of the family and cook a darn good breakfast!"
9279,28,4,1,7/6/2014,"Delicious food, quick service. The line was out the door, but we were in in less than 10 minutes. ˜Great breakfast!!!"
9280,28,5,1,7/6/2014,"I absolutely love this place. It has definitely brought me back to life after an intense night of dancing, drinking or whatever. Cash only, buy has an ATM on site. There will be a line but it is worth it... Plus you get fed while waiting on line. I've had orange slices, French fries, whip cream covered strawberries even coffee at times! The place is a little on the smaller side but has a homey/cozy feel. Side note they move quickly so do not leave your leftovers by accident... by the time you leave the front door, remember and turn back to get it the table has been cleared and your leftovers have been thrown :("
9281,28,5,1,7/3/2014,I was looking for a quick lunch spot and came across this diner with a huge American flag out front. After seeing the flag and it's almost the 4th I decided to give it a shot. Oh man was I glad I did!!! I had the banana and walnut pancakes (some lunch) and they were out of this world! The service was good and the prices was very reasonable. They only take cash fyi I'll be back and I hope other people get a chance to check it out. It's totally worth it!!
9282,28,5,1,7/2/2014,Supreme Pancakes ^_^ I will never look at IHOP the same...
9283,28,5,1,6/30/2014,I live nearby and had always wanted to try this place but was deterred by the long lines I see outside every weekend. Yesterday I decided to see what the fuss was all about and was not disappointed! First of all the line moves quickly (I waited about 25-30 minutes) and the hostess served everyone a glass of ice water and came around with french fries for us to try while we waited. Such nice service! I ordered eggs and shared the apple cinnamon pancakes which came with homemade flavored butters and were to die for. I will definitely come back so that I can try more of the delicacies!
9284,28,4,1,6/29/2014,"I have always passed by this restaurant on Washington Avenue, but never once stepped inside until today. The girls and I decided to frequent the business for Sunday brunch, but little did I know how popular this location was among the locals in the neighborhood. First of all, there was a line. Thankfully it moved forward at a steady pace as customers walked in and out of the small restaurant. Free samples were served to hungry diners as they waited for a table. I had their French toast and then later their French fries with horseradish sauce. I liked both samples, especially the latter. Their horseradish sauce has a kick to it..I thought the staff was nice and cognizant of the wait line so they did their best to seat, serve, then cash out customers. There is seating outdoors in an enclosed space, where I would have preferred to be seated, but it's not spacious enough for a group of 4. There is just something about sitting near the door and seeing customers waiting on line that is a bit unnerving. You just know that this isn't a space to lounge. You dine, pay, then dash. It felt like a diner versus a restaurant with the countertop and the mementos all over the walls. From old news clips and autographed photos to awards, Tom's has been around for more than 60 years. Don't expect any of the fancy stuff like mimosas! There is no music either. The menu items were pretty cheap. You can order breakfast or lunch all day. I ordered the chocolate cake French Toast with whipped cream and strawberries. I loved it! It was definitely worth the $6.50. It was definitely sweet so I wouldn't recommend it as your first meal for the day. I'd stopped by again if I was ever in the neighborhood and looking for a cheap meal. By the way, it's a cash-only eatery with an ATM available with a $2 transaction fee to customers. You pay at the register."
9285,28,5,1,6/27/2014,Nice neighborhood breakfast cafe. Fabulous pancakes. I had the sweet potato pancakes and they were delightful !! It's tucked away in Prospect Park area and was pretty busy during the weekday. I imagine weekends are horribly busy for this neighborhood gem.
9286,28,5,1,6/24/2014,"Be still my heart - Tom's is my favorite diner in Brooklyn by far. I have this stubborn and nolstagic preference for diners of chrome monstrosity variety - the giant Greek establishments you'll see on Long Island and New Jersey. It's what I grew up with. But Tom's knocks that predisposition right out of the park, with its charming garden in the front, walls absolutely plastered with old photos and articles, and sunny vibrancy. But enough about aesthetics. There are two things you absolutely have to visit Tom's for: the pancakes and the sauce that they serve with the crab cakes. I'm generally a savory breakfast kind of gal, but the pancakes, which come with an assortment of housemade apple, pumpkin, and other autumnal flavored butters, cannot be passed up. Better yet, order the 2 x 2 x 2 platter and just enjoy all of it until your gut busts. The eggs are top notch as well, and I don't say that easily. The service is prompt and friendly, but I've never felt rushed while dining at Tom's, even considering the 'round-the-block line that forms any weekend morning. So feel free to enjoy your coffee for a while and take in the atmosphere."
9287,28,4,1,6/21/2014,There was a line when I first came in but we only had to wait like 10-15 mins before we got seated. I got the eggs with beef sausage which was ok and my friend got the veggie omelette which she liked. We also got danish pancakes which came with special flavoring butter so I thought that was pretty interesting. Willing to come back again especially if you around prospect park.
9288,28,4,1,6/8/2014,"I love this spot! Everything I had here was delicious and the service is always great! It's not your typical diner atmosphere. I usually come here for breakfast, before work and I came here once for lunch! Never had to experience a long wait, ˜I guess because I generally come at a good time. Oh yea, this is a cash only spot! O_o"
9289,28,4,1,6/7/2014,"Tom's is a treasure. In a fast changing neighborhood, Tom's remains a bastion of tradition, and nostalgia. We've been patrons for many years, and (with the exception of the crabcakes), have never been disappointed. Today was no different. Great food, nice atmosphere, and friendly service that always welcomes you like you're family just back from a long trip..."
9290,28,1,1,6/3/2014,"Let me just be blunt, the best thing about this restaurant Is its legacy. ˜I tried tom's multiple time and disappointed to the point I can't finish my food. ˜Last time I got very ill from the eggs bendict. ˜Sorry tom'tom's never again. The staff is friendly but the food is very disappointing. And I'm not a picky Eater or give bad reviews. ˜I simply do not want my fellow brooklynites ill. ˜Good luck"
9291,28,5,1,6/1/2014,"I can see why this place is so popular. It's a fun time. The food was pretty good, perhaps not worth five stars but the overall experience makes up for it. There is indeed a line outside around the block, but don't be fooled; it moves so quickly and the service once you're seated is so fast that your overall time including the line is still less than if you went elsewhere. If you're a pancake person, this is definitely a place for you. They were delicious. A woman at a table near mine must have ordered hers with the strawberries, and it had like a pound of really nice strawberries on there. I'd definitely go back."
9292,28,1,1,5/29/2014,"Came here for brunch. I have no idea what's so great about this place. It certainly is not the food. I couldn't taste the difference between my eggs and potatoes, that came with it, and a fried crab cake, that could just be the fries, which some dude was carrying around for customers to sample on a dish, that kind of just looked like someone's leftovers.. It's just very bland generic food, that you could find in any regular diner."
9293,28,5,1,5/28/2014,"Loved the ambience. Wonderful veggie breakfast, highly recommend the home made fries!"
9294,28,1,1,5/28/2014,I found this place on yelp with the higest ranking. I spent 15 min to reach that place. And it was closed. Waste...
9295,28,5,1,5/28/2014,"This is unpretentious, stick-to-your ribs diner food. ˜I've only been for breakfast / brunch on weekends, but I keep coming back. ˜ Don't let the line scare you away. ˜Instead of making a list and checking it twice, would-be diners line up inside the door... outside the door... and sometimes around the block. ˜But the place is bigger inside than you would guess and service is fast, so the tables turnover quickly and the line moves steadily. ˜Even when the line was starting to twist around the corner when I got in it, I only waited maybe 20-25 minutes. Also, they usually handout cups of coffee, ice water, and little bites of french toast or orange slices while you're waiting in line. ˜ The food: good, solid, inexpensive, huge portions. ˜ There are about 12 different kinds of pancakes, and they're all good, but my personal favorite is the lemon one with blueberries (I think they call it a Dutch or Swedish pancake). ˜We have also enjoyed the pumpkin and apple cinnamon pancakes. ˜My girlfriend especially loves the little containers of flavored butter that they always serve them with. The egg dishes are also good. ˜The Mexican omelet oozes cheese and salsa. ˜The eggs Benedict are a comforting and traditional preparation of the dish with a thick slab of salty country ham. ˜ If you don't like those things though, like all diners, the menu is long and comprehensive. ˜You can french toast, steak and eggs, meatloaf, a burger, or even crab cakes if you prefer. The staff is friendly, but brisk and efficient. ˜They are quick to take your order, the food comes fast, and I've never had to ask to have my water glass filled up. ˜That said, I've never felt rushed out the door after I'm done. They only take cash, which is a pet peeve of mine, but it works in this kind of unpretentious environment."
9296,28,4,1,5/25/2014,"Went here a few weeks ago with a couple friends for brunch. I had the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were amazing. I usually take pics of my food but this was so good, I forgot. I also indulged in their homemade whipped butters. They are delish. My friends enjoyed their food as well. ˜The also have really good fries. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the seating is a bit tight. I'm 5'8"" and if I wasn't sitting on the end in the booth, I think I would have been uncomfortable. However, I will definitely visit this place again! I heard it's crowded on the weekends. I went on a Monday afternoon and their was no wait."
9297,28,5,1,5/25/2014,"Long line, as always, even at Saturday 1030 am. However, they give you coffee in line! And, as a party of two, we were able to sit at the counter, and did not have to wait very long (less than 10 minutes). We got pancakes, and they were large portion and delicious!!!"
9298,28,2,1,5/24/2014,"I really want to give this place more stars for service, but my overall experience here was terrible, and I won't be returning. I came on a Saturday morning and wanted to enjoy a nice breakfast by myself. The line to be seated was long, but it kept moving. However, I didn't know it would take twenty minutes for a table for ONE. Several people of two were seated before me and I didn't appreciate that at all. The host kept making sure that I would be seated in two minutes, but he literally said that every five minutes. The only good thing about this place is the owner, who seems to have a lot of passion for his restaurant. He was very welcoming and made sure that I was ok. When I was served, it seemed like I was being rushed to get out and let another group get seated. I ordered pancakes which was OK, pork sausage which was harder than a rock, and eggs over easy which was a little over done for my taste. Finally, they don't take cards, but they don't even have a sign that says cash only!!! I should've just walked out without paying instead of walking all over Washington ave to find an ATM."
9299,28,5,1,5/24/2014,"I have been in New York for two weeks and this is the only place I felt I have to come back to again. The warm atmosphere is coupled with service that is excellent, pancakes with three kinds of flavoured butter... divine. I ordered the two by two by two combo, which combines a side of bacon/pork sausages with two eggs and two very fluffy pancakes... yummmm I wish I could come here for breakfast all the time. Alas, I am heading back to Singapore."
9300,28,5,1,5/18/2014,The Brit that runs this place really outdid himself. ˜ Everything was awesome from the fritters to the roast pork. ˜ I left with doggy bags and enough to relive this awesome gastronomic feast for a week. Credit goes to Laura too for making everyone feel at home and keeping the drinks flowing. ˜What a great expediter.
9301,28,1,1,5/17/2014,We had to wait in line for like half an hour and then when we go inside it was just mediocre diner food. ˜WTF? ˜There are mediocre diners everywhere. ˜Just go to one of those if you want that kind of food.
9302,28,4,1,5/10/2014,"So I literally just got back from Tom's. I tried to go a few weeks ago but I woke up around 11 and by the time I got dressed and over to Tom's the line was around the corner (no thanks). So this time when I actually woke up on a Saturday at 8 I was super excited...yay me! Anyway, there was a mini line in front of me and since it was just me the guy asked if I just wanted to sit at the counter which was fine. I ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes which were very moist and fluffy and delicious along with the homemade butters (I had strawberry, cinnamon, and some other sweet brownish butter I couldn't really figure out) The waiter was cool enough to just let me order 2 pancakes which was still way too much since I also got the pastrami and eggs and home fries. This was nothing special but I can't complain. The bell pepper in the home fries were kinda crunchy and some of the potatoes were not soft which is kind of a turn off for a potato lover like myself. Oh and I had the cherry lime ricky which was delicious. Basically a Shirley temple with a squeezed lime wedge. The counter spot isn't idea since you will be hit in the back multiple times by rude people coming in and out but it's the place to sit if you want to get in and out. I'm glad I got in there when I did because an hour later when I left the line was around the corner. The nice thing was a waiter kept passing through the long line of waiting people with samples of french fries, honey toast, and some cookie with whipped cream on top. I thought it was a nice gesture. I'd go back especially since it's right down the street and they have so many other things on the menu that I'd like to try"
9303,28,3,1,5/8/2014,"I came in here randomly looking for somewhere to eat something decent so I check the reviews and Tom's came up. From outside looks like your walking back in time, I dig the decor but it's like the other dude said your very cramped and you can feel the people behind you. Nice guy and grandma to greet you and says sit wherever you like. The place was fairly empty but took a while for us to get menus. Food was ehhhhhh. I had steak & eggs with some grits. Grits were horrible and the steak was terrible eggs were edible @ best. My girl had the pancakes and egg omelet pancakes and coffee are all I can say were Good. Waiters are nice though and they do try and make you feel welcomed that's why it's getting ***."
9304,28,2,1,5/5/2014,"So many Brooklyners raved about Tom's and I didn't find it all that rave worthy! When I walked into the restaurant, I was told to seat myself and for 10-15 minutes no one came to give me a menu, take my drink order, or at least greet me. I found a menu on my own and looked over it and decided what I wanted to order. The restaurant was not busy at all so I have no idea why it took so long to be served. Finally, I put in my order and had to ask for at least a cup of water because the server still never asked for my drink order. The booth I sat in had wobbling seats and the person behind me constantly pushed the seat into my back....very annoying! Finally, I got my food (danish pancakes, pork sausage, eggs over medium). The pancakes were delicious and huge. They were fluffy, light, and extremely flavorful. The eggs were cooked perfectly over medium which most cooks find it hard to do. The pork sausages were horrible! They were dry, overcooked and hard as a rock. $15 was a lot to pay for a pancake breakfast...especially given the experience I had. I most likely will not return for a round two."
9305,28,3,1,5/3/2014,"Perhaps ordering a rib eye and burger is not the best idea in a diner famed for its breakfast. Asked for medium and got well done for both. Super well done. Average diner fare, quick and friendly service. Cons: tables are teensy and only one unisex loo, which can be gross when you are seated beside it."
9306,28,4,1,4/23/2014,"Been here many times before because it's one of the few above average spots in this area north of Atlantic av. It's definitely been a rare diamond in the rough as well as an oasis for decent dining. This is where you want to go for breakfast. Too good to be simply called a diner. I remember the quality being slightly better years ago but the food still tries to go beyond normal breakfast fair and I have to hand it to them for having a menu that goes a little further than your typical breakfast standards. If you like pancakes, you will like this place. They offer several unique varieties with different flavored butters as an added bonus. This time around I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with a side of corned beef hash. I remember the pancake quality being more delicious the other times I've come here but as far as main dishes go, this establishment's ""B"" game is still blows away any Brooklyn diner's ""A"" game. ˜ Having said that, the side of corned beef hash was pretty much the same type of hash you would find in any normal diner. Like I said, I come here for the pancakes. I've been here several times before and I will keep coming back here. This is still one of Brooklyn's best breakfast spots."
9307,28,4,1,4/21/2014,"Great little hidden treasure. Burgers are fabulous as well as eggs and pancakes. On our second visit , we ventured to a few of the specials. Crab cakes and eggs not so good. They had a very strong after taste. Stick to the eggs, pancakes, ˜staff is super friendly and Avery accommodating. all on the money. Great egg creams and ass kicking coffee."
9308,28,5,1,4/20/2014,"The line can be quite long, the place was packed, but it was worth it!!! Today was my first time here, but I will definitely be back!!!The staff was very friendly and the food was great!!! I am so glad this was my breakfast choice."
9309,28,5,1,4/20/2014,"Snacks while you wait in line, delicious fatty diner breakfast food, cheap. Tom's is where it's at! I usually get the two eggs/hash browns/toast, which is enough food to make me feel like I'm juuuuust about to explode. The (wide variety) of pancakes are also tasty, and come with some delicious flavored butters (cinnamon, orange, etc)"
9310,28,3,1,4/19/2014,"I like Tom's but I don't love it. I think the only reason I'm super down with Tom's is because when I'm there I don't feel like I'm in NYC. More like home.. this diner close to my house in FL is similar to Tom's. So it's a nostalgic thing. Overall, the breakfast food is nothing too special. The eggs, bacon, sausage taste like most any other I've ever had. However, they have multiple types of pancakes you may have never seen before. The pancakes are good (not great). They are good.. not out of the ballpark good. I think if you are going to Tom's you should get the pancakes though.. The prices aren't that great. I mean 9 bucks for 2 pancakes, eggs, and bacon isn't that good of a price. On the weekends there seems to always be a wait and they have irregular hours on the weekdays.. that's why it's packed on the weekends. The service is pretty good and it does not take long to get your food. It's a laid back, fun dining experience. If you want breakfast at 6pm on a saturday it's a good idea. It is also decorated pretty cool too."
9311,28,3,1,4/19/2014,"The pancakes are good, if a bit overrated. The chocolate french toast is crap. All they do is drizzle some chocolate sauce and put 2 dollops of whipped cream on cold french toast. If you want something for lunch, the buffalo chicken quesadilla with fries is good and filling."
9312,28,3,1,4/19/2014,"Not a terrible wait for a table, but I was hungry. ˜Worth the wait. Got myself an omelette and that did the trick. Boyfriend got the combo and it is well worth the money. Cash only btw. It's solid food, nothing to get too hyped about. I still enjoyed the grub!"
9313,28,5,1,4/15/2014,"Really good lunch! ˜For what this luncheonette represents, it does it well. It is a well run breakfast/brunch/lunch place. It serves breakfast all day which is nice. I had a provolone burger w/grilled onions which was delicious. So was the complimentary creamy cole slaw! ˜I saw all kinds of delicious looking waffles w fruits & toppings passing by on the way to other tables. ˜I will be back and if you find yourself in this neighborhood, you should try it."
9314,28,5,1,4/14/2014,"So whoever picked up a Jersey diner and dropped it in the middle of Crown Heights was a GENIUS. This was perhaps the best brunch I've had in Brooklyn, and considering how expensive Brooklyn brunch can be, it's an absolute steal. Quite frankly, I don't even know why you would eat anywhere else. After waiting in line for only 15 minutes, we sat down and admired the very kitschy decor of stained glass and faded signs. Despite the place being really small, they've arranged for it to fit as many people as possible without feeling cramped. I ended up ordering a staple two eggs over easy with homefries and toast as well as an infamous chocolate egg cream. The old Jewish woman in me died happily over that egg cream. ˜The homefries and toast were plentiful, and the eggs cooked to order. And for less than $5! You bet I'm coming back here. Some things to know: - Cash only, but there is an ATM inside if you need it. - Usually a line for brunch, but don't let the length spook you! It usually goes pretty fast."
9315,28,5,1,4/11/2014,"Loved it. Came over from London for just this kind of experience. Real American diner with a proper breakfast... just don't have a milkshake at seven thirty in the morning. Felt pretty ill. Portions are huge! Thoroughly recommended! Also, very baby friendly."
9316,28,5,1,4/11/2014,"I love Tom's. I had heard about it from co-workers and finally tried it for lunch yesterday. It was amazing. We got seated right away, all of the staff were super friendly and welcoming, and the menu is incredible. All kinds of eggs, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches.. it goes above and beyond! I ended up getting a crab cake Florentine/eggs benedict mix which was perfection. The crab cakes were delicious and so was the spinach and feta mixture. The home fries were great too and came with this awesome spicy mayo.. delicious. To top it off, I had a chocolate milkshake that was just incredible. I didn't get pancakes but I know that there are different types of butters they give you like cinnamon and strawberry. All of the items are very reasonably priced, and it is cash only. Highly recommend!"
9317,28,4,1,4/11/2014,A wonderful little place. It has been here a long time. Rustic atmosphere. The service is excellent and so is the food. Prices are very reasonable. Our server was very friendly and did a very good job. If you can get one of her tables you are very fortunate.
9318,28,2,1,3/30/2014,"BAD: - Long lines/wait time ˜--- not worth it for this place - Food is okay; ˜nothing spectacular. ˜Definitely nothing to write home about. - ""Danish pancakes"" were supposed to have lemon zest, blueberries, ricotta, and parmesan. I can clearly see the blueberries and I do taste the lemon flavor...but where is the ricotta and parmesan??? ˜ Should I just be happy that I got 2 out of 4 of these things? GOOD: - Pancakes are fluffy and the outside is golden brown. - Prices are reasonable, relatively speaking (compared to neighboring brunch places). - Coffee is $1.50. ˜It's bad coffee but some other restaurants charge twice that amount for one cup."
9319,28,5,1,3/29/2014,This is my first time in NY. This place is awesome! Great prices for a homemade meal. Its worth waiting in the long line-they pass out free pancakes and whipped cream strawberries!
9320,28,3,1,3/29/2014,Food was delicious .the only problem was no one could read the check even ˜the waiter who scribbled it. Fishy huh?
9321,28,4,1,3/29/2014,"Food: good + Service: good + Atmosphere: great - Price: good - Overall I enjoyed it. Everyone is ""new York"" nice. Food came quick. You will definitely wait during peak hours... But they do bring you food, coffee, etc."
9322,28,4,1,3/29/2014,"I really liked how attenitve the service here was, and the pancakes are about as fluffy as pancakes can be. ˜I enjoyed the huge portion of grits which came with my eggs. ˜ ˜Its hard to give Toms four stars because there is nothing really amazing about the simple food on their menu, but everything is exicuted very well and the service was great. ˜For pancakes I had the lemon ricotta panckaes which were pretty good, but I think I'd go blueberry pancakes next time as the lemon ricotta pancakes had a bit too much artifical lemon flavoring in them for my taste. ˜Tom's is definitely a good neighborhood spot for simple breakfast and great service."
9323,28,3,1,3/27/2014,The steak and egg was overdone. The pastrami and cornered hash was good.the potatoes and pastrami had a crunchy taste.my friends ordered steak and eggs not that great and cornbeef hash was really burnt. I have had better maybe chef changed.
9324,28,5,1,3/27/2014,"I've been here enough times to know that 1) its better to come during the week and 2) if you get caught on the weekend line it's totally worth the wait! Came in today for something different and not my usuals: mexican omelette and/or lemon ricotta pancakes. Today, I had the meatloaf w/a veggie omelette and it was great but my bf had the steak and eggs...the steak was AWESOME SAUCE! OMG! Grilled to friggin' perfection! Topped everything off w/a slammin' black & white egg cream! Love this place!"
9325,28,5,1,3/25/2014,"Went again last Friday with my hubby. I had the fried chicken cutlet with scramble eggs, and french fries. ˜Toms does not play around the cutlet was the size of the plate. The food was delicious"
9326,28,1,1,3/18/2014,"Still an overrated diner with almost raw home fries and the peppers are too crunchy. Prices are getting higher too. There are too many other options in the area now to wait for a breakfast that I could make better, and my GF's lemon ricotta pancakes are much better."
9327,28,5,1,3/17/2014,The only place I ever want to go to breakfast ever again in my neighborhood. Best pancakes in the free world.
5532,28,4,1,3/13/2014,"Came here with friends for a late brunch (2ish) and were somehow very lucky with our timing -- got seated right away. After that initial amazing service, it was kinda meh but the food was deelish so i didnt mind. Dont remember all the orders but i know we were all happy and stuffed. Spinach feta eggs benedict were perfectly cooked but a bit too much of the mushy saut?ed spinach...gotta work on that ratio of mush and yums. Sunny side eggs and ham -- very basic i know i know The jalapeno burger looked delicious but the jalapenos were fresh so im assuming the spicy meter was high The reuben looked like the perfect amount of meat for a normal human...not the usual 8 pounds of meat Lemon ricotta pancakes were devoured as was the challah french toast In general, the fries were crispy and fat so not for me...the home fries were yum but had fried onion in em so again, not for me...and the cappuccinos tasted too much like hot chocolate. Overall, ˜it was def a place worthy of another visit soon"
9328,28,4,1,3/11/2014,"The food and the service was great! Fortunately we went on Friday for breakfast. Tried to go the next day, but the line was tooooo long (around the corner). If we had the time we would've waited though. ˜I would suggest, as popular as Tom's may be, it would help newcomers find the place easier if there was better signage."
9329,28,5,1,3/10/2014,"This place is awesome, during the 30 minute wait the staff brought food out to the line so we could snack while we waited. I ordered pancakes and they were fluffy and wonderful; I topped it off with their home made cinnamon butter. I am going back every time I go to Brooklyn."
9330,28,5,1,3/10/2014,"I HAD to check this place out because everyone has been raving about it, so I decided it would be the first place I grabbed breakfast out since moving to Brooklyn. I thought it was going to be a mind-blowing experience since everyone seems to love it so much. I had to say though, I wasn't SUPER impressed, though the food was good and the portions were huge. I got a whipped ice coffee which I truly disliked all around. I get that it could go with the whole diner thing of soda water, etc, but it seriously tasted like water and a tiny bit of coffee syrup with a mound of whipped cream on top. Meh, not my favorite at all. I also got the apple cinnamon pancakes with a side of sausage (for $3 extra). The pancakes were really good, and the portion was HUGE. I had it with the cinnamon butter (I really disliked the pumpkin kind, but the strawberry was really good). I went with my boyfriend who got a hot coffee and the 2x2 deal, and our total was $27, which to me, is a little pricey for breakfast, even in New York. However everyone was nice here and it was a really good atmosphere. Maybe I just didn't order the right thing. However I'll definitely be back to try other stuff on the menu."
9331,28,4,1,3/10/2014,Came here for the pancakes at around 2pm. Wait was about 10 mins on a Saturday. Surprise that we had to wait even but who are we kidding. this is NYC afterall and one of the highly rated breakfast places. We had the bacon omelet (mediocre) and the danish pancakes were amazing! Yes I will come back for your pancakes and your decor is dated but it gives you so much character!
9332,28,3,1,3/9/2014,"Went here today and tried their mango and walnut pancakes. The pancakes were no doubt extremely fluffy and light but the mangos in the pancake were of the frozen kind so they were really hard. The ham I got with my pancakes were decent. I think I'll go with the omelettes next time because they looked so damn delicious. So far, a 3 stars cause their pancake didn't impress me much. The vibe was pretty nice though, really busy but still with an amazingly calm vibe, oh and don't get me started on the decor. It's like Christmas and Easter in one room with all the Christmas lights and wall decals. Very warm and welcoming."
9333,28,5,1,3/9/2014,The waiters are so nice even though I feel like one of them hit on me in front of my boyfriend. It's clean and quite and the food is amazing. The hot chocolate was so yummy will go back again
9334,28,4,1,3/6/2014,"Classic diner with extra character. Tom's is not the place you want to go if you're trying to be up-market or go vegan but if you want a tuna melt, pancakes or something with bacon on top, it's the place to be. Lot's of photos and knick-knacks decorate the walls and the staff are courteous and friendly. Most importantly, they have proper big mugs for you're tea and coffee. I've heard a couple of people talk about lines out the block but I've been lucky because every time I come here there's no line and I'm seated straight away! No credit cards taken but they have an ATM in the place. Perfect neighborhood diner."
9335,28,5,1,3/5/2014,This place was great! I came here last year with a group of 25 students visiting NYC. ˜We called and they were so accommodating and gathered up tables for us in no time. ˜We come to NYC every year and plan to go back. ˜Actually planning to go back this week!!! On top of the service the pancakes and flavored butter was out of this world delicious!! I only wish I lived in NYC so I could come more than once a year!
9336,28,4,1,3/3/2014,"It's a breakfast diner. You wait for a table and eat breakfast - not anything crazy unique. Just simple, delicious breakfast. Always a safe bet. Perfect for those mornings where you just want to eat and not think about where to get some fancy brunch."
9337,28,2,1,2/26/2014,"Breakfast the other day (a weekday morning, around 10:30). A babbling drunk was prowling the block as I got out of my car. Place is a bit tight and oldish. Sourpuss older lady behind the counter looks like she hasn't smiled since the Truman administration. Table I got was not clean, despite having been set with flatware and napkins. Got the 2 by 2 by 2 breakfast (2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage). Eggs were decent. Sausage was a bit overdone, but otherwise fine. But the pancakes ... ugh! I read so many reviews here RAVING about the pancakes. Has something happened since these were written? These cakes were mushy and almost flavorless (save for an unpleasant lemony(!) aftertaste -- and I had NOT ordered the lemon-ricotta ones). Truly, I've had better pancakes at IHOP and Denny's. Maybe the great pancake cook has moved on? Or maybe s/he was just having a bad day?"
9338,28,5,1,2/24/2014,"This place is a MUST VISIT. Don't be fooled by this wonderful restaurants facade, once inside, you'll experience that cozy diner feeling that everyone longs for. Everything on the menu is amazing and tastes well above the average diner! I'm a huge fan of pancakes and french toast in general, and I make sure to come here when I have a craving that simply won't be curbed ˜by your chain restaurants *cough iHop!* or by the many other local subpar diners. I enjoy coming here with friends so that we can order as much off the menu as possible and share to experience it all. Do NOT let the lines on the weekend discourage you, its worth the wait. But if you're just not in the mood for lines, come on a Monday morning if possible! Enjoy."
9339,28,4,1,2/20/2014,"There was a line out the door but worth the wait, good food and friendly service....We were served coffee while waiting outside and cookies with whipped cream.....It was a nice extra...We will definitely go back"
9340,28,5,1,2/19/2014,Most home grown place ever -- everyone is so sweet and they give you treats while waiting in line (I have never not stood in line for brunch at this place!) totally worth it-- the food is great and priced very reasonably.
9341,28,5,1,2/18/2014,"If ever there was a restaurant that everyone in the entire world should visit, it's Tom's. Tom's is perfect in every way, except they only take cash. On an off-time, it's easy to walk right in, get a seat and enjoy the almost Southern hospitality that accompanies the absolutely delicious food. Even on a crowded brunch morning, the experience is worth the wait. Like any quality restaurant in New York, Tom's is not immune to the massive lines that can build up on Saturday and Sunday mornings, the New Yorker's favorite time of the week. But Tom's stands out in its inability to allow patrons to wait hungry and without coffee. In short, they know their customers. From sweet potato fries to pancake bites to tiny cookies with whipped cream and always accompanied by coffee, it's difficult to spend time outside Tom's without getting a taste of the experience to come. If the service isn't impressive enough, the food assuredly is. I've never tried anything at Tom's I didn't love, most especially the lemon ricotta pancakes. Sounds a bit weird, I know, but they are the absolute best pancakes on the planet. No contest. Even if you're not into trying new and amazing things, the silver dollars, chocolate chip and any other variety of pancakes are well past satisfactory. As are the omelets, most especially if they feature spinach. I could talk all day about this neighborhood gem, but you won't really get a feel for it without taking a chance and visiting. Do it, don't regret it."
9342,28,5,1,2/16/2014,"Delicious and well priced!!! Ate the belgian waffle, home fries, & eggs. Service was excellent! Only complaint is how small the restaurant is. But the line to be seated moved quickly. Definately a place to check out! I plan to eat here again."
9343,28,5,1,2/15/2014,First time in my life I'm giving 5 stars to anything that isn't my boyfriend. Who's Tom anyways? ..is he hot!?
9344,28,5,1,2/14/2014,Toms is a staple in my mind. Ever since I could remember I've always come here when in the area. Don't make the mistake of coming on a weekend morning when it's beautiful out cause you can wait on a long line which takes away from the experience. The food is always great and always a hit. Inside the decor is no frills but it has the nice neighborhood old school feel. Come here hungry and leave here full!
9345,28,5,1,2/11/2014,"In NYC over the weekend for #NYFW I was staying in BK and I was visiting the BK museum. There was a 15-20 wait ( normal) when we arrived and there was a line wrapped around outside. This place gets 5 stars b/c during our cold 15 min wait outside, the staff came out to greet the patrons with hot appetizers and coffee complete with cream and sugar. Of course the food was wonderful and this place has some of the coolest decor I have ever seen. This is def on my must have brunch list while visiting NYC from now on."
9346,28,4,1,2/10/2014,"This place is so cute! My roommate and I stopped by here for lunch after visiting the Jean Paul Gaultier exhibit at Brooklyn Museum. The diner sits on the corner of Washington Ave and Sterling Pl luring customers in with their cute all-American music. Inside, it's perfectly warm and cozy, just how you'd picture a classic American diner to be! We were seated immediately and promptly greeted by our wonderful waitress. There are two menus - one for Breakfast (which is served all day) and one for Lunch onwards. We ordered two hot chocolates, a chocolate cake, and the Fried Shrimp entree. Hot chocolates were perfect for the weather, and the chocolate cake was served warm (yum!). The Fried Shrimp entree was huge, my roommate and I shared and still didn't get to finish the whole thing. It comes with vegetables and a side of potatoes - we picked the spinach and Home Fries. Everything was delicious, and I still can't get over the size of those portions! Overall great food, great place, great customer service."
9347,28,4,1,2/8/2014,"What a cool old-school diner! Line was out the door but servers brought out little treats to keep us happy while we waited. Definitely worth the wait but make sure you save enough room for what you order, the portions are pretty big!"
9348,28,5,1,2/5/2014,"This place is adorable. My friend and I walked a mile in the snow to get there and it was definitely worth it. What's funny is the sign outside doesn't even say ""Tom."" It just says ""Restaurant."" It has a warm home-y feel to it. Our server was pleasant and sweet. Also, there sat a man next to us who sat alone. He appeared to be a regular because I didn't even hear him order and he was brought out his drinks and food. He had two glasses of soda and I thought he was meeting someone, but it turns out the server knew he would finish the first one and want a refill. OH and the CHIPOTLE SAUCE. I'm a fan of chipotle anything. I would drink that up! They do keep it old school and only take cash. There is an ATM, though. I'm envious that my friend lives close to here. I'm sure she'll be stopping by more often."
9349,28,5,1,2/3/2014,"I've been coming to Tom's for over a decade, used to come as an adolescent every weekend or so for brunch with the fam. ˜ NOW ME AH BIG MON so i come with a friend or a date ever so often. ˜But in over 10 years it hasn't lost it's touch, just probably got more white, which is cool with me, I'm all for diversity and gentrification (it has its pluses, nobody get political and shit with me). So basically you can have breakfast for $21 for two people in a warm and highly hospitable environment. ˜I mean highly hospitable, like when the lines are around the corner on the weekends you will get free hot tea, coffee, cookies, or oranges, they won't leave you hanging on that line. O YEA AND I'M BRUSHING THROUGH IT BUT THE LINES ARE NORMAL ON THE WEEKENDS SO BE PREPARED. IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT THO IMO (IN MY OPINION). The food has never let me down. Good pancakes, good omelettes, french toast, the crab cakes are great too, I prefer to share it because it's to heavy for my taste. ˜ So that's all folks. ˜Go to Tom's, feel cool, feel like you're down for knowing about it, because it is so POPULAR, but lots of Brooklynites have no clue what it is... SO IT STILL IS TO THIS DAY A HIDDEN GEM."
9350,28,5,1,2/2/2014,"Crazy line, tight, packed restaurant... It may not be the most glamorous place to brunch but the food is awesome and everyone waiting in line knows it. Good coffee with a kick, large portions, and the potential for some leftovers. I definitely recommend the Mexican omelet and dipping your home fries in that spicy thousand island."
9351,28,4,1,1/27/2014,"So I went to this place for breakfast and must say I was very impressed. I figured it would be crowded since this place does have rave reviews; but the line moved quick and efficient. The service and staff was very nice, polite & patient. Food was delicious and @ a great price. Def. will be going back in the future. Thumbs up!"
9352,28,5,1,1/26/2014,"I've been to Tom's for the chicken parmigiana & twice for breakfast. All 3 experiences so far have been awesome. The service is good & the food is cooked home style & taste the same EVERYTIME. The last time I went I actually had to wait in line, it wasn't bad but was a but nippy outside. But they had a waiter bring coffee & snacks out to everyone in line while we waited. So sweet!"
9353,28,4,1,1/25/2014,"Delicious food, fast and friendly service, old school feel of Brooklyn. ˜You have to squeeze yourself in the bench. Minimal sitting space. Great place for breakfast."
9354,28,3,1,1/22/2014,"Maybe I'm just spoiled-- I just moved to Brooklyn from Boston and Boston has a MILLION breakfast spots-- but I can't say that I'm too excited about this place! I'll definitely give it credit for being one of the ""quintessential"" diners in the area. The line is usually long but it seems to go pretty quickly. I do love the fact that they bring you coffee and cookies and treats while you're waiting! But I have yet to order anything that I've been really impressed with. I've been three times now and I've tried three separate things (lemon ricotta pancakes, danish pancakes, and some kind of veggie omelet) and none have lived up to my expectations. I'm not saying any were bad, they just weren't great! I need to go for lunch sometime. I tried the fries and they were pretty good! Maybe that's where the magic happens."
9355,28,5,1,1/21/2014,Simply the best! Egg cream-awesome and creamy Pancakes-fluffy and sweet Bacon-crisp and salty Perfection!
9356,28,4,1,1/21/2014,"This is one of my favorite go to breakfast places in NYC for a cheap and dependable brunch meal - the only reason its 4 not 5 stars is because I have had better overall (albeit more expensive) brunches in NYC and Brooklyn. ˜For diner food this is a 5+ place. Consistently delicious food, great prices, great service. This past Sunday I got there at 9am, no line, maybe the first time in my life - but even when there is a line the great staff brings you around slices of oranges, pieces of incredible beef sausage, and cookies with whip cream on top - awesome! I ordered the veggie omelet with beef sausage added in (did I mention how awesome their beef sausage is?). ˜Home fries on the side are jazzed up by some bits of onion or something in there, and two slices of toast all are complimentary accompaniments. ˜The coffee is decent (not the best) and always full. ˜Our table shared the danish pancakes (blueberries, ricotta, lemon zest and magical goodness with a side of three homemade butters) they were as always amazing. ˜My friends got the Mexican Omelet which I've had before and is great/was great as well as the corn beef hash which got gobbled up. If you are in the neighborhood this is a great place to eat - highly recommended!"
9357,28,4,1,1/16/2014,"fantastic service in a casual, positive environment Ricotta pancakes, Reuben, and meatloaf with egg white were all delicious Over-rated Cherrylime Ricky and limited parking in the area"
9358,28,4,1,1/13/2014,"This is the friendliest greasy-spoon breakfast place around this area. Food-wise, this place has a lot of yummy diner hits: beef sausages, super fluffy pancakes that come on plates as big as your head, french fries fried in things that make them super-addictive, reasonable coffee with free refills. It does have one or two misses --I would avoid the eggs, for example, which are sadly not fluffy or loosely prepared enough for my taste. But honestly, the reason people keep coming back here is because the wait staff and the owner are so damn *nice*. They feed you while you wait in line at this cash-only place. The other day -- after I've come here over half a dozen times before -- I woke up inexcusably late meeting a friend (slept through 2 alarms), and they kindly told my understandably-annoyed-at-me pal that he could skip the line once I finally arrived, almost an hour later. ˜They seated us promptly, brought us coffee, and were overall exceedingly nice to us. In previous visits, they've been extra-nice about ushering people in when it was rainy outside, about giving out hot ciders... In conclusion, I love this place. It's the kindest greasy-spoon breakfast diner in Brooklyn."
9359,28,4,1,1/12/2014,"This is one of the best diners I've been to, excellent breakfast/brunch...I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with strawberries and they were delicious, ˜the coffee was very good and my friend and I had in my opinion the best seats next to the window. ˜The place was completely packed and that's always a good sign. The weather wasn't the best, it was raining, windy and dreary. People were still lining up to get inside and be fed at Toms. I would definitely recommend it for brunch."
9360,28,5,1,1/12/2014,"Great Breakfast. Low Prices, Cool Atmosphere. Best Waffle I've ever had, came with 3 unique butters - Banana Strawberry, Cinnamon, and Pumpkin. Server told us they made each butter daily, rotating different flavors in. The Atmosphere was great, the place really has kept a '40s vibe. As we were leaving our server gave us free cookies, and we got a nice goodbye from an elderly woman behind the bar who seemed like the owner or family of the owner. If you're looking for a great pancakes or waffles, this place is a must."
9361,28,4,1,1/9/2014,"Good Food!!! Good customer service and the breakfast is amazing!!! I love to get scramble eggs with bacon, home fries, and a nice bowl of hot grits!!! Next time I dine here I'll try another dish!!! This Diner is definitely worth coming to. And the prices are decent."
9362,28,5,1,1/7/2014,"This place truly does live up to it's name (and it's song!). Came here while visiting a friend who lives in Brooklyn. She said this is the go-to spot for breakfast. When you walk in, it looks like a grandmother's house with decorations. Don't let that fool you; think warm, delicious food that is waiting for you. My friend ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes. Oh my! So delicious! And I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. So good! Definitely try their house butters. My favorite was the cinnamon one, but I think they're all good. As for the service, on point! Quick and friendly staff. We ordered and got our food within 10 minutes! And for those who end up waiting for a table, a warm, elderly gentleman will come around with a platter of their pancakes, sausages, or other tasty house item to keep your tummy happy. What service! Tom's is definitely a place that I'll be looking forward to stopping by the next time I am in New York!"
9363,28,2,1,1/1/2014,"I guess it can be considered a decent diner and the staff is very friendly but I would not under any circumstance wait in line to eat at Toms. The eggs Benedict was pretty terrible. Soggy muffins, lousy ham and the hollandaise???? It was like some kind if cheese sauce looking flavorless orange goop. Its a waste of time to offer eggs Benedict and serve it with a crap,fake or terribly wrongly made sauce. Crab cakes with your eggs? It is not real crab and how dare you pass them off as real. The gravy looked like light brown corn starched slime not worth eating. I think if you just order a burger or a simple bacon and eggs you should do OK. I previously reviewed the newer Coney Island Toms which was a disaster and the original Toms is not much better. I understand that its just a diner but i would not send my friends to Toms so sadly they get a two star rating sorry."
9364,28,3,1,12/31/2013,"Pretty standard, I wasn't blown away. It's not a bad place, I've just had better pancakes. These didn't taste like they were from scratch like I expected them to be. I had the cinnamon blueberry & my boyfriend had the cranberry. - Both mediocre. The thing I loved about this place was the fries! I'd give them 4 stars for that. It's hard to find fries with that kind of crisp. Two of the three butters they give you for your pancakes are good too. I didn't like the red one."
9365,28,4,1,12/28/2013,What else is there to say? Opened in 1936...there's a reason it hasn't closed. Service was surprisingly amazing. Better than I've had in some of the nicest restaurants in NYC. Food is exactly what you would expect and priced accordingly... definitely recommend
9366,28,1,1,12/28/2013,What happened?? I used to love toms. I ordered eggs Benedict and the hollandaise sauce looked like cheese wiz and the English muffin was soggy. The home fries were flavorless. I added so much salt I got hypertension. My boyfreind ordered Mexican omelette and he could hardly tell the difference between the omelettes innards and our dog's food. It was revolting to say the least. Good thing we didn't wait in line. I felt like telling the people on line to save your Saturday and run. The place has gone in the opposite direction the rest of the neighborhood-a disgusting gross meal. ˜I would give this place a D. A bodega has a better breakfast then this swill they call food. I went to my standby pequena's on vanderbuilt to swab my mouth and recover.
9367,28,4,1,12/8/2013,"A pretty decent mom and pop place! It has a nice, home-y feel to it. I've heard that this place was popular and the line goes out the door most times but we got lucky because it was the day after Thanksgiving and they were able to seat our party of 7 together with no wait! They have your typical diner menu options. I opted for the eggs benedict because I started an addiction to Eggs Benny earlier this year and now I must try it wherever I go. It was pretty tasty! Not the best but still a delight to eat. And the home fries it came with....mmmmm mmm! I just love potatoes in general and their home fries were a nice compliment to the eggs benedict. I washed it all down with a nice warm cup of hot chocolate (because coffee makes me feel sick and nauseous). Overall, food was decent. I liked the atmosphere. Servers were friendly and prompt. If you're ever in this side of the neighborhood, give this place a try!"
9368,28,4,1,12/2/2013,"What else could I possibly say about this place that hasn't been already covered. Washington Ave staple and with good reason. I don't think I've had anything here that wasn't just diner classic. Highly favor the Mexican style eggs and chicken combo and yes their fries. Waiting in line is bearable thanks to kind freebies from the restau, though good tip would be to come right in at 9 or before to get immediate seating. Also, the new owner (nephew?) has actually ventured to open this place for dinner. Breakfast dinner, well count me in!"
9369,28,2,1,11/24/2013,"People said this place was good for pancakes. It's not. Below-average spongy greasy-spoon diner kind of things, that get tough after four minutes on the table. Really not good..."
9370,28,5,1,11/23/2013,"What everyone says is true. Tom's is great. Really good food, the friendliest waitstaff I've encountered, and a wonderfully cozy and warm atmosphere. Blueberry pancakes are the tits. I had the huevos rancheros and they had just the perfect amount of kick. I normally hate spicy food, but god damn, That was great. I tried some eggs Benedict which were also fantastic. And the best fries I've had in years. Just perfectly crispy. And yes, there'll be a line outside the door, but it moves really fast, and they bring coffee, cookies, and French fries outside for everyone waiting in line. Cash only, but there's a cheap ATM inside. This is a great place that I'm sure I'll be going to again, very soon."
9371,28,5,1,11/22/2013,"Danish pancakes. still thinking about those Danish pancakes. their beef sausage is very good too, and they make their own flavored butter. ˜incredible"
9372,28,4,1,11/17/2013,"Had breakfast today finally at Tom's. Have lived in Brooklyn all my life and just made it there. My HS bestie (known each other 30+ years) and I ordered the eggs florentine which had a good mix of spinach and feta cheese. The hash browns were done well and loved the spicy sauce which was served on side. I also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which were perfect in flavor and fluffy - nice size too. As you wait on the long line, they bring samples of food to try. Today it was french fries with spicy sauce and honey toast. Very good tasting! The coffee was soothing - it was brewed just right. The oj wasn't special - it was Tropicana (waiter told us). We sat in the back which is roomier and away from the line. I like atmosphere and this place is wonderful and cozy. I didn't give it the full 5 stars because if I were sitting towards the entrance it would have bothered me having people leaning so close (there is a divider but I'm particular about eating and having people stand near me). You'll see what I mean when you visit. All in all a very nice dining experience. Thumbs up!"
9373,28,5,1,11/16/2013,"No, this isn't the Tom's Restaurant from Seinfeld or the Suzanne Vega song (I've actually been to that diner, and it kinda sucks. I had one of the most boring, tasteless meals of my life there). This is the better one. The Tom's Restaurant in Brooklyn that is only open for breakfast an lunch and knows how to do brunch. There's always a line on weekends, but the line is worth it, because the restaurant staff bring food out to the line as they wait. I had small servings of french fries, fruit, cookies, and silver dollar pancakes served to me as I waited. I basically had breakfast before going in to have breakfast. And then the breakfast I had in there was extraordinary. These are legit the best pancakes I've ever had. Two words: Harvest Pancakes. Make a note, then go there and shove them in your face. A word of caution, though: Don't come with a group larger than 4 people. Otherwise, it'll be a bit cramped."
9374,28,2,1,11/13/2013,"Sorry to say I was pretty disappointed! Service was rushed - all 3 of our orders arrived with mistakes - cheese in an omelet that wasn't requested, sausage instead of bacon, sauce not on the side. TINY table for 3 people. Pancakes were tasty but, the rest meh."
9375,28,4,1,11/9/2013,"Good belgian waffle, hot chocolate well balanced not too sweet. Good atmosphere and well hidden. ˜Overall good breakfast"
9376,28,2,1,10/21/2013,Forgettable. They served better food to me while I was waiting in line than when I actually ordered. I don't understand all the hype. I know it's an old institution but they need to step their game up.
9377,28,3,1,10/21/2013,"**Cash only** People love this place, and I can see why. It's consistent. ˜They're very friendly will serve you food while you wait in line on a busy Saturday morning and it's a decent price point. I must say though, I go for those butters and the decor. The butter that accompany the pancake and waffles is out of this world. The pancake sand waffles are pretty good. I'm from down south and I'm actually partial to Waffle House Waffles (gimmie the lard baby). Portion sizes are awesome, I actually ate leftover banana walnut pancake for breakfast today. The food isn't lick your plate good, but its, I know I'll get something decent so lets go to Toms good. I've only been for breakfast but hopefully one of these days I'll make it over for lunch or dinner."
9378,28,4,1,10/19/2013,I have been ordering the cheeseburgers in this place and they are really good. The fries has a coating of something on them so they are not really good as are the onion rings here but i love the cheeseburgers. The atmosphere in this place is really nice. It makes you feel like you are in some out of town place and not in the city. Gotta check it out. When I try the other stuff on the menu I will report back.
9379,28,5,1,10/19/2013,"Line when we got there but it went fast and they give out samples of food while you're waiting, love it! Service was fantastic and prices were very reasonable. Dishes are big and can easily be split between two people. Food was AMAZING. Loved it"
9380,28,4,1,10/19/2013,Great little diner with a great wait staff. I asked about their egg cream and next thing I know the waiter brings one over for me to try. The Eggs Benedict were also fantastic!
9381,28,5,1,10/18/2013,"CASH ONLY!! ˜(The 3rd time I ate here I forgot...) ˜But they have an ATM inside. Cheap, tasty, high quality food!! ˜Love, love, LOVE this place! ˜They make their own flavored butters! ˜ The only thing I dislike about this place is how they plate their food. ˜I love getting the 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage deal, but they layer the pancakes on the bottom, only overlapping them a little, and then put my over easy eggs on top of the pancakes. ˜I usually bust a yolk trying to rearrange the food so it's easier to eat, which is very annoying. ˜I don't know why they just don't plate their food in a way that makes sense. ˜But this gripe isn't enough to detuct a star. ˜I live literally about a min away (on foot, obvi) so I come here a LOT. ˜I've also had their veggie omelet, which is also GREAT! ˜ Their sausage is so tasty! ˜I definitely recommend it over the bacon. If this place was a 24-hour diner, I would be soooo happy."
9382,28,5,1,10/15/2013,"So I didn't really listen to the lady's recommendations and got their meatloaf. Ehhhh... But their grits, eggs, sausage, pancakes and waffles were superb. I'm definitely going back for egg Benedict's and other pancakes next time!! The cherry on top is: they feed you when you're on the line because they know how long of a wait it is! Sooooo gooooood"
9383,28,5,1,10/12/2013,"I just had the danish pancakes and they were amazing. Fluffy with a nice hint of lemon flavor. ˜We also ordered sweet potato pancakes and they didn't disappoint either. ˜I love that they serve flavored butters on the side. ˜We also really enjoyed the service and the ambiance. ˜Overall, great brunch place."
9384,28,5,1,10/11/2013,Delicious brunch spot. Amazing selection of pancakes and delicious savory options. Get there early to avoid the inevitably long lines however.
9385,28,5,1,10/11/2013,"Being from Austin I've always thought the best pancakes were kerby lanes gingerbread pancakes but this place has the most amazing cinnamon banana pancakes with assorted butters (that's right MULTIPLE types of flavored butters!) that I have conceded that, in fact, toms has the best pancakes. Also, great bang for your buck! Friendly and (mostly) fast service."
9386,28,2,1,10/9/2013,"Can i say overrated right away? The wait to be seated was out the door and around the block, although they do come around with samples of meat and pancakes to make you feel better about the wait. Its easier to get seated with a party of 4 or more rather than 2. They have this keep it original feel with the decor which is eehh outdated and cluttered. The food did come very fast after i placed my order. What turned me off the most is when i got my omelet it was burnt! I absolutely hate over cooked or burnt eggs!!!! Well mine were burnt, with a brown crust on the outer layer. where do they do that at? They seem to burn everything, even the pancakes had that same crust on them. Just for that i will never go back!!!!!!"
9387,28,5,1,10/6/2013,"Our daughter brought us here for Sunday breakfast and let me tell you, the food is unexplainably good! The pancake don't need any syrup and the corn beef and hash are the bomb. If your in Brooklyn it's worth the visit and the wait."
9388,28,5,1,10/5/2013,"These guys were five star awesome! So unbelievably nice!! Gave us a free drink and didn't push us out at the end of the night, smiles the whole time. Potentially the best pancakes I've ever had. I went with the Danish ones since you know I recently found out I'm half-Scandinavian. They were lemon ricotta blueberry amazingness. Don't even need the flavored butter. Good thing I'm running a half marathon in the morning."
9389,28,3,1,9/29/2013,Average food an long wait don't match the hype. I prefer Cheryl's Global Soul down the street.
9390,28,4,1,9/29/2013,I love this old fashion place. I enjoy the good and the customer service. The food is great and the menu is out of the world I love the crab cakes.
9391,28,5,1,9/27/2013,"This might be one of my favorite spots ever. Very friendly, fast service. They feed you coffee & snacks while waiting in line (it takes the edge off for sure)! The line on the weekend is deceiving, if moves fast. Delicious food, cute, old Brooklyn feeling. A nice change of pace from all the ""hipster-y"" places in the area. Try an Egg Cream, it will blow your mind!"
9392,28,5,1,9/21/2013,"Best pancakes ever. I went Saturday for brunch and the line was out the door. Apart from the unreasonably fast service, the staff was unreasonably calm in dealing with the volume. They also came around with plates of bacon and pancakes as well as cups of coffee for folks waiting in line. Probably to avoid folks getting hangry. Basically I'd give them 1000000 stars if I could. Go there. ASAP."
8460,28,5,1,9/14/2013,"I would give this place 2 thumbs up if my hands weren't so busy eating the free sampler pancakes and cookies Tom's wait staff gave us as we waited in line for a table! The line was out the door for a Saturday morning ~10:30am, but it was relatively quick, around 15 minutes. But the wait went by quick as the service while we were waiting was wonderful. When my company and I got seated, I ordered the Pumpkin Walnut pancakes and my company got an omelette with fries. The first bite of my pancakes was heaven. So fluffy, not too sweet, great texture. I ate my first pancake with ease and euphoria, but I had trouble eating the other 2 pancakes as I couldn't handle the build up of sugar. (Though I think this is just a personal problem of preferring savoury foods in the morning vs. sweet foods, so I'm not blaming this on Tom's at all). My company's fries were really good too. Even though there was a constant line out the door during our meal, I didn't feel rushed at all to finish our food and leave. Great service, great food. Two thumbs up!"
9393,28,5,1,9/11/2013,Best. Breakfast. In. Brooklyn
9394,28,4,1,9/11/2013,"Bring cash. ˜ No credit. If I've learned one thing from Tom's it's that I must not really like pancakes, because these were the best pancakes I've ever had, but I don't understand people waiting on line for a long long long long long long time to get into this place like it's the Studio 54 of Breakfast. What else is left to say about this place that hasn't been written? ˜If you like pancakes and lines, come on in. ˜The Danish Pancakes were the best."
9395,28,5,1,9/8/2013,"This place is an institution. The pancakes are awesome, so are the omelets. I recently had the crab cakes florentine for the first time. Delicious. The line snakes out the door and round the corner, but it moves fast, and the lovely waiters come out and with coffee, orange wedges, and other snacks. The service is great, the food is delicious, and - another thing: could this be THE single most diverse place in new York City? Everyone is here - all classes, all ages, all backgrounds, all ethnicities. Everyone loves Tom's."
9396,28,5,1,9/7/2013,"Love this place! So good to their customers. ˜There was a long line and they brought us fries and sausage while we were waiting. ˜I always get the eggs Benedict, but i know the pancakes are to die."
9397,28,3,1,9/6/2013,"Super cute place with a no-nonsense menu of diner breakfast items. ˜Four of us sat in a booth that might have been better suited for 2, but we don't mind cozying up a little bit for some good food. The coffee was good. ˜The pancakes were huge and quite tasty, the eggs and corned beef hash was very good, the eggs and crabcakes was decent. I had the huevos rancheros, which was almost awesome. ˜Almost. ˜But my poached eggs were overcooked to the point of being hard-boiled and it kinda ruined the meal. ˜I only ordered the eggs poached because they were offered under a different menu item, so I thought the staff would know how to do it. ˜They didn't. My current plan is to head back to Tom's at some point, get the same meal except with over easy eggs, enjoy it much much more, and then update this review to four stars. They probably deserve it overall, but they didn't quite deserve it this time. ˜I echo the previous reviewer who said that they do the simple things best. ˜Keep that in mind when you order and there's a good chance you'll have a great meal."
9398,28,3,1,9/3/2013,"Not quite sure what the crazy hype is about. While the place is really, really adorable and the service is warm and wonderful and excellent, the actual food is just diner food. The lines on the weekends are ridiculous-- maybe New Yorkers just are not at all used to a small homey diner experience. That said, the food is good-- great pancakes and eggs. They do simple things best. The crab cake benedict which I had once was not great, pretty dry."
9399,28,5,1,8/29/2013,"amazing food, amazing services. will definitely return"
9400,28,5,1,8/27/2013,I've been to this place so many times and I love it. It is my favorite breakfast place in Brooklyn. The pancakes here are sooo good. I usually get either the apple cinnamon or the chocolate chip. I've heard that the banana walnut are very good but I'm not a banana kinda guy. Toms also makes great omelets which they have a wide variety of as well. One thing that I usually like to get is their egg cream which is one of the best I've ever had. Their shakes are supposed to be amazing as well. This is THE place for breakfast at any time of the day! Be very careful on weekends because the line goes around the block!!
9401,28,2,1,8/25/2013,I would like to give this place 4 or 5 stars like everybody else but there is a few irks. Never mind the long line to get it or the place is small. The short fence that separates the line from the restaurant is weak. I mean I don't want to be sitting at a table with the line next to me with people breathing in my food. There is no privacy in that area of the restaurant. So here comes the food review. I got the turkey bacon omelet with potatoes on the side. The potatoes was burnt like I got the bottom of the pan. Had to ask for another side of potatoes. The eggs nothing special I coulda gotten better at IHOP. The pancake was good and their cherry lime Rickey was good. It was my first time here but ummm there's other brunch spots around to try so later Tom's!
9402,28,5,1,8/25/2013,"Amazing service and the best lemon ricotta pancakes I've ever had in my life (hint: order them with blueberries). There's usually a wait out the door, but they folks at Tom's are so nice, they'll sometimes hand out free mugs of coffee and pancakes to waiting customers. The place is an institution, and they service is always beyond friendly. Just go."
9403,28,5,1,8/22/2013,"Toms restaurant established in 1936 about a mile from my birth place. I love this place for it's civility and food. If Tom's doesn't ˜have it, you're not Hungary. Where else can you get a lollipop when you leave? One of Brooklyn's best."
9404,28,4,1,8/22/2013,"The egg benedict tasted amazing and the sauce was good too. However, it would be better if they use the Canadian bacon instead of regular ham. The French toast tasted alright but the two pieces of ham was not worth it. Other than that, it was delicious."
5492,28,5,1,8/19/2013,"Is this Tom's Restaurant of Seinfeld fame? No. But it is a Brooklyn landmark, open since 1936! You know the clump of potted plants and other foliage swallowing up the corner at Sterling & Washington? Or, on a weekend afternoon, the long line of people standing at these plants under a faded Coca Cola sign? Yep, that's Tom's - a ridiculously charming, cramped old diner with fun decor and delicious food. You get that sense of history upon walking in, but also an air of fun - the walls are covered in framed newspaper articles, plastic flowers, and sepia-stained photographs of people you feel you should recognize but probably don't. The menu items run the gamut of traditional things you would expect at any good diner. Their variety of pancakes and waffles sound amazing and are their claim to fame - too bad I don't like sweets for breakfast. And, GRITS!!!! What other diner in New York lets you sub grits for potatoes?!! Said grits were creamy and delightful. In no other world would I order a chili omelette but there it was on the Tom's menu, gleaming at me. The omelette was perfectly heavy and yummy (though I could've done without American cheese). The fries are great and from what I saw, the burger looked perfectly cooked. Waitstaff was very friendly. They've also got a soda fountain, which means: EGG CREAMS AND LIME RICKEYS! For when you want to forgo the craft beer or whatnot and be a true Brooklynite. When we walked past at 1pm on a Sunday, there was a line out the door. On our walk back, around 3:30pm, no more line. :) There are two rooms for seating - the main room, which is very tight, and then the bright side room, lined with windows. But the windows are shielded by all the plants outside. Which is too bad, because that means you can't sing this over your coffee: youtube.com/watch?v=TdrH? (this one's about the Seinfeld restaurant though, sorry)."
9405,28,4,1,8/18/2013,"With excellent service, good food, and a vibe that's surprisingly chill considering how tiny and packed it is, Tom's is the perfect place to satisfy a pancake craving. The friendly, unpretentious atmosphere is a nice fit with the neighborhood, and the menu is affordable and extensive - classic diner with a twist. There's quite a line sometimes, but it's worth a bit of a wait (it helps that, after waiting in the line, I've never felt like I was being rushed out of my table to accommodate the crowd)."
9406,28,3,1,8/13/2013,"For crown heights/prospect heights, this is probably the best brunch you're gonna get for a VERY affordable price. It's a small place, and because of its popularity, there's often a long line. The restaurant is super cute ; they have a small area on the side of the restaurant that makes you feel as if you're in a greenhouse. Friendly service and has the perfect small mom-pop-shop aura that I like. In terms of JUST the food, I'm not really impressed. It's not very fresh. The quality is probably that of a I-Hop. I would go there to get full if I'm hungry or if I'm craving breakfast food (btw, they serve breakfast ALL DAY!). It's good, but at the end of your meal, you're just like ""Well, I could have probably made that home."" I do recommend the crab cake benedict. Rating: 3+/5 They have this savory orange sauce on the side that should be thoroughly utilized. I also got the Huevos Rancheros, which I was SUPER disappointed about. Rating: 2/5 That dish was just too salty. Their fried egg was over-done and it lacked taste. I tried adding some ketchup and hot sauce to save it, but it was still not very good. Although the menu says fresh salsa, the salsa was quite the contrary. I thought they're going to have diced tomatoes, but it was simply tomato puree, just like spaghetti sauce. Boo... Their 2x2x2 (egg, sausage, pancake) is not bad, but the sausage was a bit dry. Rating: 3/5"
9407,28,5,1,8/11/2013,"Toms serves the #2 sandwich on my ""Best Sandwiches I've Ever Had"" list: The Turkey Melt. It's a solid turkey melt (not mayo-based, nice and cheesy, good quality turkey) with two things that set it apart: First, stuffing INSIDE the sandwich. This is simple, I don't know why more places don't do it. Secondly, the turkey melt can be slathered in Tom's famous chipotle sauce. It's the only thing I ever order here (sometimes I wish I could branch out on the menu, but I can't ever bring myself to order anything else). To make a brief comment on Toms in general: I brought a visiting friend for breakfast, and at the end of the meal he declared ""I think this is the best diner I've ever been to."""
9408,28,1,1,8/8/2013,Been ordering here for years.... I literally mean since I was 11 I'm 23 now ..it's going down the service is bad for delivery ..the delivery guy takes so long ..my food was cold at least 3 times ..the Spanish guy who answers the phone is rude when he answers ...I remember when Toms was timely and on point..the food is meh nothing spectacular ...NOTHiNg at all I can never figure out why the line is always so long ..The pancakes are too thick and I've been sent half cooked bacon ..and sometimes they forget bacon for my bacon cheeseburgers ..why do I bother ordering from here anymore ...this place isn't he same as when I was a kid ..TOMs needs better management !!!!!! Don't believe the hype ...
9409,28,4,1,8/7/2013,Food was awesome. Quite small for such a busy place.
9410,28,2,1,8/5/2013,"I wasn't quite impressed with this place even though it was ""Zagat rated"" (whatever that means without a number rating). The home fries were dry. The crab cakes Florentine were made with imitation crab meat (my pet peeve). The hazelnut cappuccino was too sweet. Not even the water was passable. Service was decent. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon."
9411,28,4,1,7/24/2013,"Such a great Brooklyn Diner experience, my sweet potato pancakes with strawberries and root beer float were glorious... I love the service here, while waiting in line we were even offered slices of orange, ginger biscuits and water. AND I saw the Suzanne Vega lyrics and autograph on the wall, is it really THE Tom's Diner?"
9412,28,3,1,7/20/2013,"Maybe it's the Jersey in me talking, but Tom's having a 4+ star average on yelp is kinda crazy to me. ˜With the exception of some really good meat-related sides (fantastic turkey bacon and really good sausage), the food is just kinda decent, though plentiful. ˜The basic pancakes are just ok, folks, don't get so excited--I've got some diners in NJ for you if you need an education in the genre. ˜I haven't tried the fancy pancakes with random cheeses in them, to be fair. And the service/atmosphere...it is a beehive, exactly as another reviewer said, and the tables are practically on top of each other. ˜Moreover, the last time I went, we (two ppl) were asked to move from one four-top to another four-top (fine, whatever), but then the hostess kept coming to take chairs from the table we moved to, asking us to get up each time, without any sort of apology. ˜The check gets unceremoniously thrust at you mid-way through the meal. ˜It's already harried enough in there, no need to make it worse."
9413,28,3,1,7/15/2013,"Solid food, nice ambiance (I sat ""outside""). ˜Classic diner food, pretty fast service. ˜I had the Danish Pancakes and would definitely recommend them to others! ˜(Lemon Ricotta & Blueberries = delicious.)"
9414,28,3,1,7/13/2013,"This place has definitely changed since the last time I was here in 2003. It was busy then, but it is a circus now. Imagine eating inside a beehive. All of the workers are doing what they need to do, and are amazing. They should get medals. I hope when they go home they have sensory deprivation chambers waiting for them. Because I'm stressed out just sitting here, trying to eat breakfast. Inside a beehive."
9415,28,3,1,7/10/2013,"Well, at least it wasn't expensive. The service is a bit rushed and non attentive. The pancakes were just ok, but god what was really bad was the maple syrup! i know they give you the bottle so you can drown your pancakes in that, but its awful! it tastes like oil with sugar...not good."
7004,28,5,1,7/10/2013,"This incredible diner dates back to the 1930's which the decor makes abundantly clear. It is also one of the most respected and acknowledged breakfast places in Brooklyn for people that know about it. I took a friend there for the first time a few weeks ago who saw the line outside and looked at me like, 'do we really need to wait 30 minutes for this?' Within 15 minutes they had brought out free sausage, then free coffee. She said with a smile, ""Ok, I get it."" The pancakes and milkshakes are outstanding, and in general all of the food is just really good in this quaint little diner. Tom's is awesome and I never want it to change. If I could only assign 5 stars to one review on Yelp this would be it."
9416,28,4,1,7/8/2013,"Perhaps it's the ""Brooklyn Boy"" in me. ˜Perhaps I've seen one too many movies. ˜I'm not sure what it is, but if you're a diner with old fashioned decor, older tables/booths, wood walls and floors and a counter to boot, you've already won half my heart. ˜Throw in good food, and I'm pretty much in love. ˜And so now you know the source of my love for Tom's. Located on a corner of an area that wasn't always so welcoming, gentrification is slowly creeping into this sector of Brooklyn, making this a destination spot for students and locals alike. ˜The outside looks like an old store with a white background and dark lettering. ˜Tons of plants surround the outside and a chalk board lists an impressive number of dishes that are part of the menu. ˜When you walk in there's a counter to the left along with the cashier. ˜Based on previous reviews, I had expected a long wait but nope, my girlfriend and I were seated almost immediately at lunch time to boot! Our waiter came over quick and in no time we had water and coffee on the table. ˜Once we ordered, our food came within 10 minutes, nice and quick! ˜This gave me time to look over the place with its charming yet offbeat decor that included Christmas lights, various framed photographs and awards. ˜In some places this would be a mess, here it somehow works - even the stained glass windows (seriously!). My girlfriend and I had both heard the pancakes were awesome so we had to order them. ˜She got the mango pancakes which actually had bits of mango in them. ˜I liked it more than she did. ˜I ordered the sweet potato pancakes which, shockingly, tasted very much like sweet potato! ˜Add on their cinnamon butter and syrup and it was like a perfect combination. I also had two eggs sunny side up with crab cakes. ˜The eggs were perfectly done with the runny yolk that I love. ˜The crab cakes were cooked perfectly. ˜Cripsy on the outside with wonderful crabby goodness inside. My only complaint is the service. ˜My empty coffee cup went unfilled for the entire meal (a first for me at any diner) and the same can be said for our water. ˜Basically until we were done eating no one checked on us. ˜Still, for the price you're paying and frankly given how the place looks and its rather...rustic nature, none of this comes as a shock. Overall I loved my experience at Tom's and would go back in a heartbeat!"
7636,28,4,1,7/8/2013,"So before Five Leaves, there were lemon ricotta pancakes ;-) I got the corned beef hash, cherry lime rickey and lemon ricotta pancakes. The corned beef hash tasted like something out the can (which is something I actually like) The cherry lime rickey is just another way of saying shirley temple. The lemon ricotta pancakes were good bordering on alright, I just wish they came with fruit by default (like Five Leaves). I'd def come back to try the other breakfast varieties they have simply because I just like the place and service. We were in and out faster than a usual Five Leaves visit since we're served by dudes trying to get people in and out where as with Five Leaves, you're served by hipsters where customer service is, ""we'll get to you when we get to you"". NOTE: the place is CASH ONLY, but they do have an ATM Machine inside."
9417,28,4,1,7/7/2013,"First off, the only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because it's cash-only. It's 2013, this is ridiculous. Kudos to Carnegie Deli for finally arriving in this century for allowing customers to pay with credit cards. A place as popular in the neighborhood as Tom's should get on that train ASAP. Having said that, this place is great. The service is quick, the place is always crowded but not enough that my girlfriend and I couldn't get a table right away on the patio. I had the chocolate chip pancakes and they were fantastic. They really hit the spot. At $8, it was a great bargain compared to all the brunch places in Manhattan that would charge twice as much for the same food at half the quality. I definitely recommend this place if your group is 3 people or less because otherwise you'll likely have to wait a while, though if you're not in a rush, the food is definitely worth it."
9418,28,5,1,7/6/2013,Best Banana Walnut Pancakes ever. No hyperbole.
9419,28,1,1,6/29/2013,"WOW! ok so this morning my lovely neighbor tells me of this great diner.... TOMS DINER! she tells me how great the pancakes and the corn beef hash! she sells the food to me so well, i start to salivate! iSaw, iCalled, and iOrdered! (danish pancakes, corn beef has, bacon, over easy eggs and a side of sausage - milk & oj!) 20 mins later the food is at my door, oh my im excited! $33.00 yes! JESUS must have made my f-ing food! $33.00 plus a $5 tip to the nice delivery guy.... iPrepare to eat my LAST SUPPER! and then it happens! the sausages are so over cooked they taste like POWDER, my over easy eggs look like that they've been frying all morning! ˜""egg over hard?"" didnt even know they made eggs this way... pancakes r DRY.. i called to ask y my eggs were so hard and she told me i asked for eggs over HARD! lmao i died laughing (in my head) she offered to send new eggs out, and told me it would take 15mins .... i passed! waste of money! could have gotten better food for $5 ANYWHERE! dont waste your money! on the bright side, some places are ""DINE IN ONLY"" clearly this was one of them!"
9420,28,4,1,6/25/2013,"Great classic breakfast food in a small restaurant. ˜The pancakes are really fantastic and I believe worth the trip. ˜I'm a big fan of the mango walnut. ˜The line on weekend mornings can get quite long, but actually moves pretty quickly. ˜To make the wait a little easier, they hand out cookies, bits of sausage and orange slices. ˜Be aware that it is cash only! ˜When it gets crowded, service can be a little inattentive. ˜But they are always nice and responsive to any requests."
9421,28,4,1,6/22/2013,"Great dinner, Great price, Great Service. The Moussaka was amazing, the portion was perfect, and it came with a side salad. The service was unexpectedly friendly for new york."
9422,28,3,1,6/21/2013,"I have to admit, I was a little let down based on all the hype surrounding this place, so maybe my review is a little dampened by my high expectations. The outside of Tom's looks like an abandoned greenhouse, with plants and bric-a-brac piled everywhere and growing wildly. You can tell at first glance this place is an institution, one of those old joints that has hunkered down and insisted on staying exactly the same as it was 30 years ago. The inside is a touch more modern diner than the outside suggests, and is bright and open. The bric-a-brack continues inside, lining the walls and shelves of both dining rooms ˜with memorabilia and traditional diner accoutrement. The main room has more of a retro feeling, while the small back room is reminiscent of the sun room off your grandmother's living room. I went to the back, as some of my dear Yelper's suggested, for the window view. Given all the foliage, however, you really can't do too much gazing outdoors while you eat. I'd also encourage you to be bold and open the windows, which makes all the difference in the world as the back room was stuffy and overwhelminlyg smelled like lemon cleanser when we sat down. Okay so enough of my story telling, what was the food like you want to know? My expectations were also high here as the Yelp app told me this place was ""loved among vegetarians"". Okay well, maybe not so healthy vegetarians ,and definitely not vegans. I think what Yelp meant by that statement was ""they have a lot of pancakes"". I made the mistake of ordering something too fancy and was really let down. The eggs florentine were over-cooked, the spinach was almost certainly from a can or frozen, and the hollandaise tasted more like melted cheese. My boyfriend got the Dutch pancakes (ricotta, lemon, blueberries), where were nice, but nothing special. The staff was lovely. Overall I think this is someplace you go mostly for the kitsch, to have something simple with friends, and have a good time. Don't go there expecting culinary wizardry and you'll be okay, also if you're a vegetarian who actually wants to eat fresh vegetables, maybe someplace else."
9423,28,4,1,6/20/2013,This is what I think of when I do think of Brooklyn. ˜The decor and food were classic. The ambiance was cool and chaotic at the same time. There are two sections and we were seated in the extension which was fine because it provided more elbow room to dig in those cakes (pancakes that is). The apple pancakes & eggs challenged my taste buds in a good way and I think I'm in luv ... And try the iced tea!
9424,28,3,1,6/18/2013,"Typical diner food. not sure why it's rated so high when there's so many other brunch places around. I came here twice and got pancakes, which were good, but nothing special. The line is long, but moves fast. They also give you free samples while you wait in line. Also, if you choose to sit at the bar, you can get seated much faster."
9425,28,5,1,6/18/2013,AMAZING!!! 100% worth the wait! pancakes are delicious
9426,28,3,1,6/17/2013,"We were in search for a neighborhood breakfast one Sunday morning and wandered to this place. It appeared to be a bodega but much more lay hidden inside the strange windows. A long line to get a table but it seemed to move quickly. We were in a bit of a time crunch so we opted for the breakfast counter. Same food there, afterall. Very tempting pancake options, beware if you're carb concious--you'll be forced to try mango peach walnut variations. That's what we did. Turkey bacon too. I love turkey bacon. Big portions aren't our thing so we got an entree with some sides and were satisfied. Think I'm going back today!"
9427,28,5,1,6/16/2013,"My girlfriend and I managed to go to this place on a Friday morning when there was no line outside the door. She had waffles and I had French toast. Now I see what the big crave is, the food is amazing for a diner. Her waffles were so fluffy, my eggs and home fries were to die for. ˜Toms is definitely a neighborhood gem."
9428,28,5,1,6/14/2013,"Oh, Tom's! Get in my mouth!!! I brought a boy here early one morning, and his immediate reaction upon walking in was, ""YES."" I couldn't agree more. The decor is kitschy and charming, and apparently pleasing to even the most curmudgeonly of male companions. The food is good, solid diner food, which is basically all I want in life. Breakfast, and lots of it. I've never tried their famous pancakes, but I hear they're to die for. You can tell they take care and pride in their food preparation. The staff is super sweet and quick to force delightful little samples on you if you happen to wait more than five minutes for anything, which is rare. (I hear it gets pretty packed for weekend brunch, though, but trust me, it's worth it.) Great for groups and families, too!"
9429,28,4,1,6/12/2013,"My husband and I had our last breakfast at Tom's before we had to head back to California. ˜I love breakfast! Tom's was just a short walk from our rental place in Brooklyn. ˜It's a cute little cafe/diner at the corner of Washington Ave. ˜You are greeted by this little old women handling the cashier. ˜tip: CASH ONLY. We had to use the ATM inside the diner. ˜I knew what I wanted and that was the RICOTTA ˜LEMON PANCAKES! I was a little hesitant because cheese in pancakes? But boy was it good. It melted in your mouth! They had many different flavored butters that were all delightful. ˜The waiters were awesome. Overall, it was a great great experience!"
9430,28,4,1,6/10/2013,"I've been to this place a few different times and every single time is excellent. The most recent time I had the Supreme Pancakes (Pancakes with blueberries, mango and walnuts) and it was fantastic. I've also had the plain pancakes before and enjoyed those. I've only gone to this place at breakfast/brunch times, so if we don't get there early enough, there is a bit of a wait. But unlike most places, they feed you while you're waiting in line. The last time I was there, a person who works there comes around with a plate of cinnamon toast, then a bowl of orange slices, then a plate of fries. If you're looking for good food without pretension, Tom's is the place to go."
9431,28,4,1,6/10/2013,"Awesome little ˜breakfast and brunch spot. ˜I prefer this place in the winter when there is a line stacked up outside the door around the corner. ˜The workers come out and ask if you would like hot coffee, they bring out a cup of coffee while you wait in the line outside. ˜All the while others are bringing out samples of their foods outside such as pancaked, fries, etc. Most of their foods (omelets, pancakes, french toast) are great, not the best in the city but very satisfying. ˜I'm the type of guy that is mainly worried about the quality of my food but the atmosphere here and it being nearby prospect park in the winter made me really enjoy it. ˜I enjoyed going here eating and then walking down to the park and walking around a lot. Yes, the food isn't the best, but once in awhile you just have to award a 3-star quality place 4 based solely on the atmosphere it offers."
9432,28,3,1,6/9/2013,"Unique place and the main owners are really nice, but this restaurant is just too damn packed and the food isn't that good. Try somewhere else for brunch, like The Spot or Miriam's."
9433,28,5,1,6/7/2013,"I am blessed to live right around the corner from Tom's. Super friendly and attentive staff, delicious food, and very reasonable prices. Try the western omelet with grits and wheat toast. I'm from North Carolina, and the omelet and grits at Tom's are some of the best I've found anywhere. Also, a tip: Try the bran muffin. Get it toasted. Grape jelly. Delicious. Finally: Tom's is now open for dinner on weekends! I think they stay open until 9PM on Saturday and Sunday."
9434,28,2,1,6/1/2013,"I like the historic old diner ambience. As far as food goes, it is extremely average that I would not go back. I could never tell Ricotta Lemon pancakes had any ricotta or lemon. I have made the pancakes before so I expected certain texture and flavor. Tom's ricotta lemon pancakes tasted like a ˜average diner pancake I would not order. Their Mexican omelet was overcooked so it was rubbery. When we went to Dutch Eating place in Reading Market Terminal, We had amazing, feather-like texture pancake and omelet with bacon on the side. With the 2 coffee, the bill was only $16. At Tom's we spent more than double for almost the same thing. Well I would not go back to Tom's just for the food for sure."
9435,28,3,1,5/27/2013,"Finally braved the super long line. It seems like parties of 2 have all the luck because we ended up skipping at least 40 people who were in line with parties of 3 or more. They are supposed to be the best place for pancakes ever but maybe the place has been too overhyped? I have had better pancakes and there isn't much of a selection if you don't want them. (Typical diner food) Overall, it was decent diner food but there are plenty of places in the neighborhood with more unique, fresh and healthier options."
9436,28,4,1,5/26/2013,The food was ok but it was too cramped/crowded for me.
9437,28,4,1,5/22/2013,An old fashion diner that's apparently been around for ages. ˜I just learned of this place several months ago and I've spent my entire life in Brooklyn. ˜Go figure !!! ˜Very unassuming on the outside but your traditional diner on the inside. ˜The food was hot when it arrived to our table and it was tasty. ˜It's not often that I'm in the mood for diner food but the next time the craving comes along I'll be going back to Tom's.
9438,28,5,1,5/18/2013,"I've been to good ol' Tom's 4 to 5 times, and every time it never disappoints. Sure, there's a long line at the door, but they serve you coffee, oranges, and french fries with a delectable spicy sauce while you wait. Sure it's a bit crowded and a bit cramped, but the atmosphere and the staff are undeniably charming. Sure it's cash only, but the prices are fantastic!!! I used to work in the area, and the boyfriend and I always look forward to making the trek out here from the uws. He prefers omelets, especially the chili one. I prefer the pancakes, and a spinach omelet from time to time."
9439,28,5,1,5/17/2013,Do not mind the crazy line out the door; just ignore it and eat here!! They feed you while you wait!!! Every single thing I've had here is delicious and the staff is extremely friendly. The last time I came here I had just match to a residency program and they brought me a free slice of cake and sang to me! Lol (super embarrassing but extremely cute) I love this place and wish I weren't moving so far from it! I would definitely come here if you're looking for some deliciously filling food and a reasonable check to go with it!
9440,28,1,1,5/14/2013,"Sorry, do not understand the hype. The coffee tasted like bile; the lemon ricotta pancakes tasted like regular pancakes with Pledge mixed in. I love good ole greasy spoon diner food as much as the next person but this was a letdown."
9441,28,4,1,5/13/2013,"Tom's is a definite must visit in Brooklyn. The service is top notch, everyone is attentive and treats you like family. ˜We've been twice, once on a Friday afternoon (crowded but no wait) and Saturday morning (empty @ 7am but the crowd comes by 8am). Whether empty or full you still get the same great service. ˜The pancakes are a must try - the banana walnut are my personal favorite - they are light, fluffy, and bigger than IHOPs. ˜Additionally the flavored butters are an unexpected sweet treat as well. ˜Once you go to Tom's once you just know that you'll be back again!"
9442,28,5,1,5/11/2013,"can't think of one negative thing to say abut this place. ˜You just feel warm and tingly inside every time you walk in, and if there is ever a wait, they will pass out cookies!! ˜This is a place everyone should go to at least once!"
9443,28,5,1,5/11/2013,"My favorite brunch place in NYC. There's always a line out the door, but it moves fast and waiters bring snacks and coffee to you while you wait. The pancakes are fluffy and have great flavored butters, and they have an epic variety (apple walnut, ricotta and lemon, sweet potato, pumpkin, etc). And the huevos rancheros are INCREDIBLE. Ample serving sizes. And that's just the tip of the iceberg (the menu is huge). Definitely a must-have experience for any New Yorker or visitor looking for an authentic experience."
9444,28,2,1,5/8/2013,"it's aight, typical diner food. ˜the cherry drink is good"
9445,28,5,1,5/6/2013,The fries are very crispy w/ spicy chipotle sauce. Crab cake florentine was tasty w/ extra holidaise sauce. Food is very comforting. Breakfast is great. good servings.
9446,28,4,1,5/6/2013,"service is friendly and fast good people-watching good wall-pics creative breakfast options delicious speciality butters served with pancakes (pumpkin, cinnamon, and strawberry) nice over-easies good salty sausage AND good prices"
9447,28,5,1,5/5/2013,"This place is crazy in a strange and good way. First off, I can't believe there was a queue at 2:30pm in the afternoon, well I guess it's sunday and this place serves breakfast ALL DAY long. I must admit, this place has got to be the BEST customer service I've ever had in Brooklyn. They constantly bring out little snacks for you while you are waiting in line. If I were a homeless person, I'd just stick around and keep moving to the back of the line. First it was oranges, then french toast pieces, then coffee, more oranges, and then cookies. I was in the mood for a serious burger, and their burgers are very tasty. I wish the bun would cover all the meat but just shows you how colossal their burger patties truly are. I thought I'd be able to have my burger and have enough room for waffles, but my eyes are always bigger than my stomach. A burger runs you about $5 and the deluxe is $10. If there is a long line, do yourself a favor and check if the counter seats are available. Services is fast here, but be weary that passer byers may bump into you if busy. I will definitely be back. The crab cake florentine looked sooo good."
9448,28,5,1,5/5/2013,"This place is diner food done right. ˜I am not someone who seeks out diners when I go out, but this place is definitely worth a stop. ˜Put the diet on hold for a moment and live. ˜3 kinds of rather tasty homemade butters came to try with our pancakes, which were some of the best I have had. ˜All of the food we had was excellent and it was very reasonably priced. ˜ What makes this place so special, though, is the hospitality of the owner, who goes out of his way to make sure you have an amazing experience. ˜He greeted us with coffee while we waited in line and later brought out some pancakes for us to try. ˜I felt like I walked into a big family party. ˜That man is larger than life and we could all learn from him about how to live and how to run a restaurant. Don't worry if there is a line! ˜It moves fast and they bring out complementary coffee and snacks (pancakes, fries, turkey bacon, etc) to make sure you are comfortable!"
9449,28,5,1,5/4/2013,"It speaks to the value of an establishment when a patron battles the inconsistency of the G train just for a spot in a cracked vinyl booth. Double that esteem when your visiting mother from Wisconsin gets excited about the prospect of stopping by. My first time at Tom's was the happiest of accidents, my mother and I traipsing down Washing Avenue for a quick bite. I thought the hedge-lined exterior was intriguing, so we stepped inside and sat at the counter. Egg salad -- swell (but can you really screw that up?). Vinegar French fries -- yes, please. Egg cream -- how could you not? The gentleman behind the counter was exceptionally friendly and even passed a vanilla shake our way, just because. Every subsequent visit to Tom's has meant a wait in line, but it's worth the pretty brief wait. Besides, there's typically someone walking up and down the line with coffee, orange wedges, and even a plate of those lovely vinegar French fries to tide guests over until they can grab a spot inside. The fare is all typical diner grub, but there's something so charming about this neighborhood institution. I just ... I just always want to go to there."
9450,28,5,1,5/4/2013,"This place is amazing -- like stepping back to a time where hospitality mattered, food quality was great, prices were reasonable, and butter was used in everything. The lemon ricotta pancakes are unbelievable. Don't let the line outside discourage you. It moves fast and they bring you complimentary coffee and snacks (pancakes, french toast, fries, etc) while you wait -- who does that anymore?! Definitely check this place out!"
9451,28,4,1,4/30/2013,"After reading the reviews, I decided to try this place out and was highly impressed. As noted this place is cash only and very reasonable. The service was great and so was the food. I ordered the 2 for 2 - (2) Eggs, (2) Pancakes, (2) Pork Sausages and a side of Bacon. I finished everything!!! and did not require seconds. Also the staff came around and offered fresh oranges. I enjoyed myself as so did my girlfriend, we definitely would return again."
9452,28,3,1,4/29/2013,"I come here quite often for brunch Sundays. ˜They are often packed so be prepared to wait. ˜My usual is the pancakes, sausage and eggs meal and I love it. ˜The street parking on a Sunday isn't bad either."
9453,28,5,1,4/29/2013,"Delicious!!! Luckily we came on a Friday early morning, so we didn't have to wait on a line because we were one of only about 5 other tables at that time. ˜Pancakes delicious! ˜Service so friendly. ˜And they brought us out cinnamon toast with honey, compliments of the house! ˜So good. Wish I lived a closer - maybe up the block! - so that I could come here every day! ˜Ha!"
9454,28,3,1,4/22/2013,Food was delicious but I felt rushed out and the food was brought lukewarm.
9455,28,5,1,4/18/2013,While the wait can be long on Sunday for brunch the food and excellent service more than make up for the wait. I highly recommend the pancakes and homemade flavored butter.
9456,28,4,1,4/15/2013,Best brunch spot around. Be prepared to wait if you go on peak hangover recovery time as the place gets super crowded. Once you get in you will see why they love it. Go here it's worth it.
9457,28,5,1,4/15/2013,"Tom's ˜Restaurant IS the Best Diner In Brooklyn! If you are near Prospect Heights make the trip; It is well worth it. Breakfast is their specialty with great flavored pancakes and waffles along with your basic eggs and bacon. No hash browns though. Home fries toast and grits are their sides. Ask for cheese on their grits and get two slices of American just like mom used to do! Read all the pictures and framed newspaper clippings on the walls and get a history lesson of the neighborhood. Get there early on the weekends if you don't want to wait in line. But if you are waiting in line they usually bring appeteasers out for the starving masses waiting. But don't fret, the line moves fast. Enjoy your meal!!!"
9458,28,1,1,4/13/2013,"Had been meaning to go for some time!? However, most of the dishes were really very unexceptional. My poor daughters burger should have been sent back but we were afraid to do so. The service was friendly and attentive at all times. We sat at the very first table so of course were being watch by what I can only image is the grandmother owner. My pancakes were the only dish I would recommend and it came with favored butters as well. I ended up sharing with no problem my pancakes with my poor (sans burger) daughter. ˜ I have no real proof for what I am about to report so draw your own conclusions. Four of us got sick within less than 12 ours of eating. I was bedridden unable to look at food. Unfortunately, this place has the strength of being a diner but along with this all the negatives of a diner as well. Example: when using the washroom I noticed that when I entered the room my hands felt wet. After completing my assignment I realized the connection. There were no hand towels and the only way to dry was a slight breeze coming out from what I would have a hard time to call a hand dryer. I have always had problems with food places that do not have hot water or proper ways to dry your hands. I really don't want to shake hands with people with wet hands when I am eating out. So buyer beware. I hope Tom's that truly is a neighborhood favorite reads this and reacts to right an easy to fix wrong. It's a fun place but we certainly will never return after this experience. Sorry"
9459,28,4,1,4/9/2013,"Who doesn't love Tom's Diner? Morons. That's who. Apparently this place has been here forever and I've overheard the manager/owner/stern-looking-Italian-dude tell someone that this place has been owned and ran by the same family for 3 generations. I always get the Corn Beef Hash and Eggs, side of French Fries, Rye Toast and a side of Bacon. Sometimes I get a Pastrami or Brisket Sandwich to go. Someone wrote on here that the Corn Beef Hash is out of a can. If it is, I want to know where to get that can so I ""can"" ˜(derp!) have this stuff at home EVERY DAY! The Bacon can be a bit crunchier, but I don't mind a bit of chew on my bacon so it's fine. Sometimes it's too crunchy but, hey, stop being a shiny lil' bitch. The coffee can be a bit stronger but I don't need too much of a wake-up-coffee on weekends when I'm willing to stand in line for one of the only decent afternoon breakfasts in Brooklyn. On the contrary, after eating my meal here I'm usually ready to go back to sleep. Their French Fries are of the battered variety - which in my opinion is the only french fries that should be allowed at restaurants. They're awesome when you dip it into their Chapotle Sauce - which is actually good on everything! There is the most sweet woman (that I guess is called a greeter?) assigning seats and otherwise making sure that everyone is comfortable, at ease, and getting what they want in a timely manner. The somewhat indimidating Italian-looking owner, as others have mentioned, does go from table to table to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves and their food - in this context, you may wonder what I mean by enjoying themselves... Don't worry, this is a family friendly place. The pastrami, corned beef, brisket and roast beef is extremely and surprisingly legit for a random diner in brooklyn - and I only go to 2nd ave deli for my meat so... The decor, as others have mentioned, is very Christmas-y and old-school. Your grandmother would k'vell - if Christmas loving gentile grandmothers could k'vell! NOW... The only real issue I have with this place - and this very important - do not negate this - is the electric hand-dryer in the bathroom. It is probably the first electric hand-dryer ever invented. I can actually dry my hands faster by blowing on them myself. By the time you're finished letting it waft a slight (bathroom-germ infested) breeze on your hands and you get even close to dry, you're ready to start your whole bathroom routine all over again because it all took so long. There are no paper-towels or anything to use instead, but you will notice that many people use the toilet paper to dry their hands. This leaves your semi-dry hands with shredded toilet paper all over it. It looks like the skin is peeling right off your hand. So, in case you were wondering, this accounts for the constant line outside the bathroom: people are just standing there mindlessly with their hands under that useless electric hand-dryer. If it dried any slower, it would actually be making your hands wetter! Come on, get the Dyson or the Excelator hand-dryers. They take 3.4 seconds flat to dry hands. This is a HUGE issue for me, so I HAVE TO take off a point. I'm so sorry. They have to get a better hand-dryer so that it actually dries. Tip: Take one of the napkins they give you - or better yet, steal a couple near the ice bucket station on your way to the bathroom. Other than that, all the staff is always kicking ass, giving me a hassle when I don't come in with a girl for them to check out, know what without me even having to order and pretty much treat me like a king. There's a depressed looking older Mexican woman that cleans tables and steals entire bills from her employer when no one is looking, but who really cares??? The old greeter-man that gives out free stuff while you wait in line (former owner?) never remembers your name or the conversation you had with him the time before, but who cares??? It makes it all the more fun and you know what he's gonna ask and what you're gonna tell him already so you get to refine the conversation every time to hilarious effect. Bottom line: don't come to this place! You're getting in my way, causing big lines, you don't like Christmas in July, you're ordering burgers at a diner like an asshole, you're not dipping in chapotle sauce, you're standing there like a dick trying to dry your hands... Forget it. Go somewhere else so I can have my afternoon breakfast in peace."
9460,28,4,1,4/8/2013,"maybe the best pancakes in brooklyn, and certainly the best budder spread around. as good as breakfast gets"
9461,28,5,1,4/8/2013,"A Brooklyn Institution the last 70 years, popular for a reason. EVERTHING I'VE EVER HAD HERE IS DELICIOUS, Sweet potato pancakes! Banana Walnut pancakes! Real maple syrup and a range of delicious homemade butters! My mouth is literally watering writing this review. MMMMM.... SO GOOD! Go Eat There!"
9462,28,4,1,4/5/2013,"I went here for brunch last Saturday. Not too familiar still with this area in Brooklyn but slowly becoming acclaimed. My friend's lady friend introduced me to this spot though and I'm so happy to have come upon it. The only down side is that the line for waiting to get in is usually LOOOOONG. Super long. We were even late going to brunch/lunch at around 1:30 or 2pm and the line was out the door and around the corner and took about 30 minutes to finally get seated. Was it worth it? Kind of. Hm, I'd say yes. I want to come back to sample more of the menu because everything sounded amazing and I opted for a sweet instead of savory dish which I don't normally do. However, Tom's has an enormous list of pancakes and I couldn't resist. I started with an Egg Cream because I've never had one and I know it's an old timey traditional New York thing. Surprisingly it's not as heavy as a milk shake and has a light carbonation and maltiness to it. I like it. I wouldn't get it again but I approve of it. My two friends both got cherry lime rickeys. Never heard of these in my life before. But they tasted like cherry seven up and were pretty good. I'd mix those babies up with some vodka and call it my bitch. But this is not that kind of restaurant. Very mom and pop with kitschy stuff all over the walls. Garden gnomes, flowers, wreathes, etc. For my meal I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which comes with a maple walnut flavored butter and maple syrup of course. Pancakes there are HUGE. Next time I come if I order pancakes again I'd have to split them with someone. You get three and they're incredibly fluffy. I managed to finish two and I was bursting. But the Lemon Ricotta was an interesting nice taste on the palate. I know they had more exotic ones as well: pumpkin, Danish, chocolate chip. . . And then there were various egg dishes that come with either potatoes or creamy grits. I freaking LOVE grits. Just like Britney Spears. I'm sorry. There's something wrong with me. But I really have this weird border-line obsession with grits. Okay, moving on, the only other thing I tried was their beef sausage. AMAZING. GET IT. I also hear their egg hash is impeccable."
6494,28,5,1,3/28/2013,"Obsessed with their huevos rancheros, I really like the food here. ˜When I came here the first time, we were not able to eat because the line was all the way outside with more than 10+ people waiting. I was not going to wait outside in the winter, but after tasting the huevos rancheros the second time I came here and actually was seated, I understand why they have such a following. ˜ Great service accompanied with great food. ˜What more can I ask?"
9463,28,1,1,3/26/2013,"I do not recommend this place... My cousin, aunt and I were patiently waiting to be seated for almost 7 minutes... There were 4 seats in the front however they were waiting to put us in the back in the booth.... So two white girls came in and sat in the booth they were cleaning for us anthe same guy that told us to wait handed these girls that just walked from the street. Needless to say they did not get our money. I will not recommend this place to anyone."
9464,28,4,1,3/26/2013,"Pancakes were fluffy and flavorful, they make their own specialty butters (pumpkin, strawberry, cinnamon :) and our omelet was perfect. ˜I will definitely be back to Tom's - just expect to wait as this place is very popular. ˜Luckily, a nice woman serves cookies and orange slices to the people waiting in line!"
9465,28,5,1,3/25/2013,"When you see a line WAY out the door and around the corner for this place, you'll wonder if it's worth it. The answer: it is. Note though- if you're more than 2 people be prepared to wait because this place is very small and while turnover is pretty fast, you'll still be waiting a while if you're a party of 6 or more. This really isn't the place for big parties. Came here for a Sunday brunch and got my place in line. Immediately there was a woman walking around handing out quarters of oranges to everyone waiting. She also later came around with a plate of fries. SO nice. Great touch. I got lucky and seats at the counter opened up if you were ok with not getting a table- which I was. So I was seated almost immediately. Win! Ordered the corned beef hash, eggs and 1 Danish pancake (lemon, ricotta and blueberries- ZOMG). Everything came out in lightening speed- maybe 5 minutes? I scarfed down my food- which was diner perfection and delicious- exactly what I was hoping for. I can't wait to come back here for lunch someday very soon and order a milkshake. Someone next to me had one and it looked epic. Prices are reasonable ($9-14 range for most menu items and will come with a ton of food) but remember to bring CASH! Tom's is cash only!"
9466,28,2,1,3/24/2013,"THIS IS AN AVERAGE DINER!!! ˜I had the ""Mexican Omelette"", with french toast.. I was not taken by it at all.. Everything i ate felt like i could of just made it at home... I don't like giving bad review but i really had too.. Some people just don't know good taste and go around giving all of these good review!! I would give this a one star, but the waiter was supper nice to me... So for all you locals Continue going here.. I'll be sticking to ""The usual"" on Vanderbilt...."
9467,28,5,1,3/22/2013,"Eggs Benedict is my favorite. The food and service is great. Just expect to be a little uncomfortable in the small chairs, but its all worth it. The food makes up for it."
9468,28,4,1,3/20/2013,"There was already a line when we got there around 10:30 Saturday morning. It was a short wait. Is really cool the owner feeds you while you're on line. Great brunch food,cool servers and coffee si served HOT in a big mug. Ask for their hot sauce, is good. BTW, 2 blocks from the brooklyn museum and botanical garden. 2/3 train to Eastern Pkwy stop."
6667,28,3,1,3/20/2013,"I came here last year so am retroactively writing this review. As with any diner type restaurants, they have a really large menu. I came here on a Friday afternoon and it was pretty empty because they were closing early, but I've seen pictures where this place will have a line out the door. The decor was retro and the restaurant wasn't real large. Probably seating for about 30-35. After opening the menu and taking a look at it I WANTED EVERYTHING!!!! It was like a glorified diner menu with more specialty items! We ended up ordering the Mexican Omelet and Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. The Omelet was pretty much what I expected and honestly I felt it tasted like any other restaurant's omelet. I was a tad disappointed with the pancakes. Supposedly they are famouse for the Lemon Ricotta pancakes, but I thought they tasted a bit plain. They didn't look all too attractive either when they came out on the plate. It just looked like a few plain pancakes on a regular plate. Nothing fancy. with so many items on the menu, I wished I got a chance to order other dishes like their daily specials. They have a big selection of specials such as the beef stew (Mondays only), Salisbury Steak, Grilled Chicken, Pot Roast (Wednesdays Only) and etc. I definitely will be coming back though because I feel I only got to sample the restaurant and from the other rave reviews I feel there is much more to offer in their other items."
9469,28,4,1,3/17/2013,"This place is truly a gem. Toms may not wow you with it's appearance, but the food and hospitality is top notch. We had to wait in the line that wrapped around the building for brunch for about 30mins. However, the wait didn't seem too bad, as snacks and fresh coffee were provided to all of us to help make the wait out in the cold more tolerable. For brunch we went with two eggs over easy, turkey ham, grits, toast and apple cinnamon pancakes. The pancakes were absolutely delicious, especially when topped with the strawberry and brown sugar butter! Yum! Tom's does not disappoint, you will be glad you waited in line."
9470,28,5,1,3/10/2013,Best. Pancakes. Ever. Try the lemon ricotta pancakes. You won't be sorry!
9471,28,4,1,3/6/2013,"Service here is spectacular. Things I love here are their french fries, hot chocolate, homemade butters, pancakes, bacon and burgers. I would not recommend ordering take out from here, I feel that by the time the food arrives it doesn't taste that great. I would also stick to their breakfast menu (which is served all day), I did not like some of their lunch dishes. I also wish they did not close so early. Other then that I love this place."
9472,28,5,1,3/6/2013,"Cookies while you wait on line , egg cream dessert and more faux flowers per square inch only add to Tom's multiple flavor pancake appeal. Debate the Suzanne Vega reference over eggs or waffles, but enjoy Brooklyn' s best diner at the orginal Washington avenue location bklynmike.com/2013/01/28?"
9473,28,5,1,2/27/2013,"Best diner ever!!!! This place beats IHOP anytime 'cause their pancakes are awesome! Everything about this place is practically awesome. From their food to how nice they were of bringing out coffee and French toast bites to the people waiting outside. When I went a few weeks ago, it was kind of chilly, but with them treating me and my bf like royalty in the cold, we waited. I got pancakes, which were superb!, and my bf got a bacon cheeseburger, which took a little while to get to our table but that's because they were making it fresh for him. The place is a cool lil mom and pops diner with an old school flair. My new favorite breakfast spot!"
9474,28,4,1,2/24/2013,"Really? ˜Must you be so amazing, Tom's? ˜ Let's start with what this place is: ˜a circa 1936 awesome old school diner with yummy food! I showed up here on a Saturday with my husband and there was a line around the corner (it was almost 10:30AM) and it was raining, AND we waited :) ˜It was a long-ish wait, but the lovely part? ˜This sweet older gentleman comes out every so often with some food or coffee...and with the warmest smile and kindness! ˜I don't remember the last time I had such stellar service! onto the food... 3 words: Lemon Ricotta Pancake. ˜TO DIE FOR! ˜Never in my life have I had a pancake that I wanted to eat without anything on top! ˜It did not need syrup or butter (even though you get flavored butters), it was THAT good! ˜ Go to Tom's, get thee some amazing pancakes, smile, kick back, and eat! ˜Go hungry!"
9475,28,5,1,2/23/2013,"I couldn't go a whole week without another Tom's fix. ˜Despite rain and a 45 minute wait, Tom's still exceeded expectations. ˜While waiting we received coffee, orange slices, turkey ham (DELICIOUS), and vinegar french fries with chipotle horseradish sauce. ˜ We're decided to become regulars."
9476,28,5,1,2/23/2013,The world's best pancakes (15 varieties). An old school diner (circa 1936) great food - 3 kinds of butter and great vinegar fries!! If you're in the Prospect Park area definitely a place to check out. A hidden gem!
9477,28,4,1,2/21/2013,"did you know that for every meal you order at toms they package and send an equivalent meal to underprivileged ki... what?... a different tom's?... so you mean they don't... ˜...oh. judging by the line that pours out of his door on a daily basis, tom doesn't need my help. in summary: tom's is an old timey diner that serves solid but standard diner fare. its good stuff and well worth a visit or two. i recommend. ........ and do you know what else i recommend? i recommend you not stand in line for an hour and a half just to get in. what i'm trying to say is that the grub at toms is good, but your time is gooder. ...yes, gooder."
9478,28,5,1,2/20/2013,"My most favorite brunch place. All of their Breakfast items are amazing. And don't lose heart if you see a big line when you get there. One, the line usually moves fast and two when you stand in the line you get treats for free from the restaurant owner, who will also stop and have a chat with you. Lovely and cozy place which has been around forever."
9479,28,2,1,2/20/2013,I really wanted to enjoy this place but I couldn't. I came here twice and although the pancakes were good they didn't live up to what everyone was raving about. The wait here can get ridiculous and if you think waiting in the winter can get you in the door faster then dream on. On average I've waited for a table with a minimum of 45 minutes and although they pass out freebie snacks and coffee the wait is just not justified. The first time I was here I got the crab cakes with eggs based on a friend's recommendation. Meh. I've experienced better. Second time I was here I got the pumpkin walnut pancakes and although they taste better than other places they were just a-okay. The first batch were a tad overcooked so the waiter was nice enough to bring out a new batch. Kudos to the nice fella. Props to the owner for sending out freebies so there you have it. The two reasons why this place is a two star.
9480,28,3,1,2/18/2013,"OMG visual over-stimulation! ˜I think one visit is required just for the decor, which engulfs almost every available wall surface. Came because the place is close to the Brooklyn Museum. ˜While we were in line, we were offered cookies (think mini chips ahoy) with cream on top. Yum. ˜Sat next to a couple who raved about the place and encouraged us to try the sausage. ˜Perhaps next time. Before our order arrived, we were offered free cinnamon toast with honey. ˜Yum again. ˜Ordered the huevos rancheros. Funnily enough, I liked the rice and refried beans the best.. ˜The eggs were lost under the salsa (which was a bit spicy for my liking) and hid a flour tortilla underneath. ˜Was also served with has browns, which were bland. Next time, I would ask the eggs to come with just cheese to keep it a bit more simple. ˜Would definitely come back to sample more from the menu. ˜ The way they serve free food, may be a good place just to order coffee and sit."
9481,28,3,1,2/17/2013,"Great Toms Diner! The food was good, the service was awesome, and the decor is so vintage and amazing. They had some really interesting and delicious flavored butters. Their pancakes were great. The presentation isn't mind-blowing, but I thought everything was pretty tasty! Majority of the people I went with thought the food was just average, but they aren't really a fan of diner food. If you like diner food, you'll love Toms! Parking was hard to find, and so was the diner at first. Seating/space is really limited; I would say, it is not a good place to bring kids who move around a lot. It's also not really a good place to go to if you have a large group... unless you don't mind being split up into different tables/sections of the diner."
9482,28,5,1,2/11/2013,"When it comes to brunch, I'm pretty much a monogamist. Once you find your neighborhood gem, why look further? It didn't take me long to find Tom's once I moved to Crown Heights, and when I did, it was Love at First Brunch. Here's why: -I actually want there to be a line outside when I get there. Why? Because Gus, the jolly and ever-smiling owner, brings you little treats to snack on while you wait. Coffee, yes, but also beef sausage with a hint of lemon juice, mini pancakes, turkey ham and more! -Pancakes! I'm generally a savory brunch kind of girl, but Tom's has turned me. Their pancakes are ridiculous good. And they do a great 2x2x2 combo that includes pancakes, scrambled eggs and your choice of breakfast meat. You can even order one pancake on the side if you're in more of an omelette mood (that's an insider tip, guys. Not on the menu.) -Hospitality. Did I mention Gus? The guy who hands you snacks in line? He's great, but so is the entire staff. They'll randomly bring you free things at your table every now and then, never leave you hanging, and always make sure your order comes out exactly right. -The decor is ridiculous, but it's so authentic and over-the-top that you can't help to feel transported to another era. ˜ This is a place with soul. And really fantastic pancakes. Tom's, I'll love you forever."
9483,28,5,1,2/8/2013,"Yes, there is a lot of hype about Tom's, but for good reason. ˜I've been coming here since I moved to Crown Heights 7 years ago, and I still get the same booth, the same server (Carlos, who like many who work there have been with Tom's for 25+ years! which says a lot about the incredibly kind owners), and the same consistently awesome breakfast and lunch items. ˜As I'm sure many have noted, whenever there is a line (just about every Sat/Sun) Gus or his son give out snacks and coffee and smiles. ˜Once you get inside, you are overwhelmed by the 1930's charm of the place, and even though the menu is standard diner fare, these guys are masters of eggs and pancakes, which are always cooked to perfection. ˜ I like going during the week when there's not a crowd. ˜Carlos lets me tweak the menu as much as I like: ""I want this, but I want less meat and a couple strawberries"" for instance. ˜Also, Gus is always giving out freebies. ˜He once overheard me say that I've never tried a cherry lime rickey and next thing I know, he delivers one to the table, free of charge! ˜He's also done that with an egg creme on another similar occasion. ˜ Order anything. ˜It will be substantial and good. ˜ And don't listen to the haters. ˜They only want to bash it because they waited 45 minutes on a Saturday for pancakes. ˜Go on a weekday, chat with the staff, claim you haven't tried a certain thing ;) and order whatever you like-- they'll make it. ˜Observe the way the place runs for a minute and you'll understand why it's the type of place you always leave happy."
9484,28,3,1,2/8/2013,"Judging by the perennial line outside, you'd think there is something otherworldly about this place, or that it's the only place to eat brunch in Prospect Heights. Unfortunately, neither are true - it's just a good ol' diner with lots of flair and smiley service. They're famous for their pancakes, which have some pretty exciting flavors (lemon ricotta anyone?) but otherwise are just GOOD. My huevos rancheros was big and hot but also nothing to write yelp about. Their signature chipotle mayo was amazing on the fries the waiter brought around to the shivering hordes outside, but maybe I was just delirious with hunger because it didn't do much to liven up my eggs, etc once inside. The walls are covered with old-timey kitsch and the servers are friendly and inquisitive *almost* to the point of being patronizing. For a quicker brunch with booze and (in my opinion) more local color, head two doors down to Shane's."
9485,28,5,1,2/4/2013,"I've heard so much about this place. From the outside you don't know what it is.. (No sign) it looks cold and vacant from the wait on line outside, but as soon as you step inside, it's such a warm and cozy feel. I liked the establishment since I was greeted by the bald dude offering me coffee.. pancakes...sausage...whatever. Never have I been treated this way waiting on line for seating. I took a young lady to Brunch.. I ordered the Mango Walnut Pancakes.. Chicken Cutlet and eggs... and Vinegar French fries... DAMN!!!! It truly hit the spot! The prices were not expensive and you got more than enough to eat, my date ordered Walnut Pancakes (She was being modest) The service and the food was absolutely wonderful, I will be returning to Tom's this is a perfect place to come and eat but not with a party more than 4. The place is very small so don't look to have a big gathering here. I was not hesitant to try different dishes, it honestly seemed as if I could order the entire menu and not have a compliant about the meal. Very good quality of food. From my wait on line outside about 50-70 feet from the entrance I waiting no more than 15 minutes max. The wait was surprisingly short. I recommend Tom's if you're in the neighborhood and you're thinking about trying it.. trust me hope on that line and experience the family style dine."
9486,28,3,1,2/1/2013,"I know that this place is a neighborhood icon since the stone age, but just cause something is old doesn't mean that it is good. Remember that if you drink old milk--it can make you sick. I know I may be a little tough on this old diner, and that they are super nice when there is a big line out the door by giving you ˜cookies and orange slices, but that doesn't justify the sloppiness of the food. I have been here 3 times and 3 times I've been disappointed with the food. The breakfast items are huge, but the scrambled eggs were burnt, bacon too overdone, and my hash browns a slightly raw. It isn't as cheap as you'd expect it to be, especially with the nostalgia they personify. I love that its a staple in the neighborhood. The people are nice and it will be around for another 50 years."
9487,28,3,1,1/31/2013,"Solid food, there on a weekday morning and it was empty. Good egg cream, had the pancakes which were ok. The decor was a bit.....outdated, but not the reason I went."
9488,28,5,1,1/25/2013,"Amazing breakfast, you have to try it atleast once, very classy old school diner. Need to go for the pancakes they have every kind of butter ! Very quick and good service!"
9489,28,5,1,1/24/2013,"I can't stop telling people about Tom's. In a land of American (new) restaurants with Edison lightbulbs and flat white plates with sauce artfully scattered over the food, Tom's is a refreshing breath of fresh diner air. Don't get me wrong, I love me some melty locally sourced pork belly as much as the next girl, but sometimes on a Sunday you just crave a giant plate of unpretentious fried eggs, homefries, and sausage. As other reviewers have said: -Long line for weekend brunch, but it moves really quickly. It looked like we'd be waiting in line for hours but we were in and seated in about 25 minutes. -They fed us delicious bites while we were in line- cookies, coffee/tea, orange slices (what is this, soccer practice circa 1995? I love it.), silver dollar pancakes, etc -The food is priced right! Some of my personal favorite things: -The coffee and tea are served in BIG mugs! -The turkey sausage is juicy and delicious -The kitschy decor is awesome and cluttered (in a great way) and there are a zillion silly pictures/newspaper clippings, etc, to look at while you wait -The service is SO friendly, totally efficient Only one complaint- the homefries were pretty dry. This was easily solved by the addition of a lot of ketchup and runny egg yolk, but I wish they'd been a little more oily."
9490,28,5,1,1/22/2013,"When it comes to breakfast the place can't be beat. ˜You may have a long wait to get in but you will be supplied with treats and coffee! ˜The breakfast from eggs, sausage, pancakes to waffles is all top notch. ˜I have eaten here several times and can't say a bad thing about it."
9491,28,5,1,1/16/2013,"Look beyond the close quarters and strange art adorning the walls, and you will see that Tom's Restaurant has some of the happiest-faced customers you have ever seen -- for good reason. From families of all ages to pockets of twenty-somethings doing battle with their hangovers, patrons are enjoying Brooklyn's best breakfast. The perfect weekend meal spot, Tom's boasts a classic diner menu, along with some unique and tasty brunch items like Danish pancakes with blueberries, ricotta and parmesan. Sammies are simple and delicious, and fun beverage options like milkshakes or a Cherry-Lime Ricky completes the experience. I don't personally come here for the entr?e items, but hey that's not what a diner is for, right? Service is fast and friendly in general, prices are more than reasonable, and the ambiance is...interesting. There is ALWAYS a line outside on Saturdays and Sundays, but it moves quickly and they treat you to orange slices and french fries with spicy mayo while you wait. When I first moved to Prospect Heights, I ate here three times in eight days. 'Nuff said."
7314,28,3,1,1/15/2013,"Breakfast review only -- Came here early around 8am and it was empty. My boyfriend and I had a choice of sitting anywhere. The waiter was quick and friendly, got our water and coffee in no time. I had the Eggs Florentine while he had the Special 2 by 2 by 2 Combo. Our orders came in about 5-10 minutes and the portions were huge. Before getting to the dishes, they brought over a plate of condiments from syrup, plain butter and flavored butter. The best part is the flavored butter, 3 different flavors, this really set Tom's aside from other regular diners. My Eggs Florentine was delicious, they gave a lot of spinach which I like and the eggs were perfection. The boyfriend's dish was massive, it includes 2 eggs, 2 pancakes and bacon (they gave about 5 strips, if you were to order links, then you would get 2). the pancakes took up the entire plate and these were the oval plates not your average found plates. The pancakes were fluffy and weren't dry at all. Great diner and I love the decorations they had inside and outside. Still Christmas-y here."
9492,28,4,1,1/14/2013,"Awesome diner that has been around since 1936. The owner walks around with orange peels and purell. Eclectic wall hangings, friendly service, and possibly the best french fries i have ever eaten. I like them really crispy, but not just crispy in the sense that they are brown. These were still mushy and potato-ey while the outside was crunchy. Seriously so good. And the lemon ricotta pancake with blueberry rivals the best pancake i ever ate in costa rica. The only thing it lacked was the crispy outside. But the syrup was real thick maple syrup and they give you three different types of butters. Strawberry, cinnamon and pumpkin. The pancake was just our ""side order"" because we wanted omelets as well. They were good too but not as good as the pancake. I wouldn't come here for omelets specifically. Yummy hot chocolate and old diner style glasses to drink out of. Everything is super cheap too. This is definitely a diner worth trying at least once."
9493,28,4,1,1/14/2013,"It's my favorite Brooklyn diner. ˜Yes it get's crowded but I usually plan around the swarm. ˜I usually go with an omelette, but all of their food is prepared well and it's high quality, not just feed slapped on a plate that you get at so many other diners. ˜This place has character and history, which is reflected a bit in their prices. ˜Not unreasonable though."
9494,28,5,1,1/6/2013,"I rarely do reviews but this place is really that good. Has a very classic feel, the food came quickly, tasted amazing and the service was great. Really nice touch bringing food out to those of waiting outside to get in. This is my new favorite brunch spot in Brooklyn."
9495,28,3,1,1/3/2013,"Great breakfast, they actually still make cherry lime Ricky's"
9496,28,4,1,12/29/2012,"We went to Tom's a while back and tonight I realized that I never wrote my review! We went during the week and avoided the lines. The first two impressions I had were ""what a classic, yet unique funky diner"" and ""what a friendly place."" It was unique because of all the things decorating the place make you feel a part of their history and in addition to the waitstaff being friendly, they gave us free samples of cookies. We had an omelet and the French toast. Both were very good and we left satisfied. We'd come back more often if it were a bit closer to where we live."
9497,28,5,1,12/22/2012,"This is exactly what a diner should be. ˜ Don't be scared off by the line out the door (or do, then I'll get in faster). It moves quickly and the staff will bring out free samples for you to snack on while waiting. Their 2x2x2 breakfast is the best! Affordable price for 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage/bacon. Perfect combination of sweet and salty without having to order two giant meals. Plus, milkshakes! Also, they make their own flavored butters and will bring them out to you in individual plastic containers if you order pancakes (which you should). I've seen cinnamon, strawberry, and pumpkin flavored butters but I'm sure there's more. The waitress will give you a little bag to take the butters home with you if you ask. (why not!) This is a breakfast & lunch place. They close early. They don't serve brunch. Nothing is over-priced or pretentious. Just delicious food, great staff, and a solid breakfast."
9498,28,4,1,12/21/2012,Large menu and portions. No reservations or alcohol. Good times and food.
9499,28,5,1,12/16/2012,"A Brooklyn staple- the perfect place to take friends/family from out of town to give them a taste of ""real"" New York. The prices are great (less than $10 for many main dishes) although you'll need to bring cash or use their in-house ATM. Don't get turned off by the long lines, either --- unlike most Brooklyn brunch places, Tom's cares about you while you're waiting around to be seated. They bring you lots of food and drinks while you're in line, all free of charge -- coffee in the winter time, ice water in the summer, and always plenty of bite sized french toast and sausage."
9500,28,3,1,12/11/2012,"Came here for breakfast on a Saturday morning at around 10am and the wait was pretty short - only 10 minutes or so, but got long quickly behind me. The owner (?) takes your orders for coffee/tea/juice while you wait on line, PLUS he comes by to give out samples of free fried turkey ham, french fries, and other little dishes. The line extends far into the restaurant itself, FYI, so don't think you'll get seated just because you're in the door. I got two eggs over easy, over meatloaf and gravy with homefries ($11-$12) which was good but did not make up for the homefries being disappointing and bland. No crispy texture or added peppers, onions, nothing. I should've gotten the french fries as my side instead. I hear they have a tasty dipping sauce for it. My friend got an order of fluffy pancakes ($5.50), which came with some nice compound butters/toppings, like cinnamon/apple butter and strawberry. This was pretty tasty. ˜ This place seems super popular with families so be aware of lots of babies, toddlers, and strollers in the aisles. It's much quieter in the outside seating area, and plus there isn't a line of people next to you watching you eat."
9501,28,4,1,12/7/2012,"It's hard not to love Tom's. It's one of those diners that you could find anywhere in America, and I mean that in the best way. This down-home, friendly joint could remind anyone at all of that diner they used to go when they were a kid. And if you were a kid in Brooklyn, this is that exact place. Let me say that again: Tom's is a diner. There's nothing gourmet going on, and you know exactly what you're going to get...that's part of the charm. It's nostalgia personified with its plastic tablecloths, reliable breakfast platters, mediocre burgers and fries, egg creams, milkshakes and more. You need to temper your expectations, because it's not going to blow your mind. That said, in my experience, they do two things exceptionally: 1. Pancakes. They are fluffy and amazing and I will always order them. I am partial to the lemon ricotta myself, but I don't think you can really go wrong. What really puts them over the top is the multiple flavored butters they provide. Slather those on and indulge. 2. Service. The folks at Tom's truly care. That's why they head out along the ridiculous brunch line and offer up coffee, cookies, and other little bites of goodwill. They appreciate your business, and they might just be a bit psychic. They see your hanger* and they come up with that cinnamon/butter/honey toast that will save your relationship with your girlfriend because she had just about had it with you. ___________ *Hunger/anger."
9502,28,5,1,12/4/2012,"Tom's is ah-mazing. First of all, they accommodated my obnoxiously huge party, even going so far as to reserve a table for us when we called on a Sunday morning during their busiest time! Two of our party had suitcases with them, since they were catching buses out of town immediately after brunch, and it didn't phase the staff at all. They simply stashed the bags where they could, while the restaurant was packed FULL. Amazing. Onto the food. Between the 10 of us, we ordered just about everything on the menu. The coffee and teas were served in really cute (and huge) mugs that mismatched, which I loved so much. All of the food was glorious. I had cinnamon banana pancakes, which were amazing, and picked off of several friends plates as well, sampling the dutch, ricotta, and pumpkin pancakes plus a bite of french toast, and a bite of my husbands omelet. All painfully awesome. The compound butters were ridiculously delicious. I didn't try the syrup, but I'm told it was amazing. One friend had the garden cheeseburger, and was in vegetarian lunch heaven. I stole fries from her plate and it was so worth it. It was super inexpensive, which we all loved. Split 10 ways our bill was $14 a person. There is absolutely NOTHING BETTER THAN THAT. I am in love. We live in the neighborhood, but rarely go out to eat around our home - we've been stupid. We know much better now."
9503,28,5,1,11/29/2012,"What can be said about Tom's that has not already been said. I've gone there and had so many different experiences and loved each one. I've gone there at the crack of dawn. I've gone there for lunch. I've been there with a large group of people. I've pulled a Susan Vega and been there alone. Regardless of the scenario Tom's never disappoints. I promise if you go early on a weekend (7-9) you won't be waiting long, if at all. On a weekday you can go even later without a wait, I'd say up till 11. You might have to wait on line at other times but that is part of the Tom's experience. What will you be served as you wait? Hot Cocoa? Coffee? Maybe burning hot french fries with a zesty/spicy dip? Whatever it is, it's fucking free. Grab a stool if you're by yourself (and pray Susan Vega comes by to sit next to you) or wait to be seated. You can sit in the main room which has two parts. The front could be tight but cozy. The back has booths and famous mementos of the diner on the walls. I personally like the second room with a view of the outside. You get to laugh at those suckers who are waiting outside in the cold. Get their attention and eat slowly in front of them, taunting them with the smile that only a meal from Tom's can provide. Now for the food. Milk shakes amazing. Pancakes best EVER. Pumpkin Walnut. Banana chocolate chip (not on the menu but they will make it for you if you ask). They're all great and they come with amazing spreads of jams and butters. You'll be in heaven. Crab cakes with my eggs? Yes please. Meatloaf sandwich, where have you been my whole life? Disco fries, the way disco fries were intended to be made. With cheese covering every fucking fry. Along with a cup of gravy which can be used to dip everything in the world. Cornbeef hash, sides of bacon, more crab cakes all wrapped up and dipped into my gravy!!!! I may gain five pounds and lose a year off my life every time but I don't give a fuck. This place is a classic that's actually worth the damn wait!"
9504,28,4,1,11/26/2012,Not too much more to add other than the fact that they give you coffee and snacks in line makes the wait immensely more enjoyable!
9505,28,4,1,11/21/2012,"Went to Tom's today after 16 years as a Brooklynite and all the reviews are dead on. ˜Great atmosphere, incredible eggs / bacon / pancakes. ˜I got the silver dollar because I wanted to see how good they were with out all the accoutrements. The only reason it's not getting a 5 star rating is because of the crowds (at 11 am on Wed!) are a bit daunting and seating is crowded with little room to stretch out which I like in a diner and no fountain soda. ˜ Definitely a great place for breakfast, simple menu, friendly staff and no one rushing you too leave."
9506,28,5,1,11/19/2012,"You're going to want to get the pancakes, said the woman in front of us in line, baby strapped to her chest. ""Also, the line looks long, but they usually come out and bring you coffee and snacks while you wait, so it's not too bad."" Such was my introduction to Tom's, which is quickly becoming my Favorite. Brunch. Place. In. Brooklyn. ˜(Yeah, I said it.) No, this isn't drunch, with unlimited mimosas. It's not locally-sourced-fair-trade-organic, nor is is the hippest spot 'round the park. But Tom's knows exactly what is is - a locally owned, down-home, 1930s era diner - and it isn't afraid to show it. The menu is expansive - a slightly gourmet twist on standard diner fair (think ˜fluffy lemon-ricotta pancakes, chipotle egg scrambles, and to-die-for turkey sausage)- but NOT expensive. My plate of Danish pancakes was $8. Sure enough, a friendly bow-tied older man came out the front door half a dozen times while we waited in line. Bearing a silver tray filled with tea and coffee (with sugar and cream if you please!), or a plate of the aforementioned ˜turkey sausage cut up into bites for hungry customers, he made his way down the line, joking and chatting with everyone as if he knew them. Which, well - he probably did. Tom's is a neighborhood spot. (He also brought out cinnamon toast slathered in honey - messy but SO good). I just felt HAPPY eating at Tom's, and judging by everyone's expressions, that's a common response to the friendly staff, tiny crowded table, and delicious food. Don't wait - you want to go to Tom's ASAP."
9507,28,4,1,11/12/2012,"I came here for brunch and while the line was long, it moved quickly, so quickly in fact, I was at the head of the line before my brunch companion made it to the restaurant. Also received water and a cookie while waiting on line. The restaurant is famous for its breakfast and we were not disappointed. We received large portions of pancakes and french toast which were tasty. The service was fine, and we were not rushed to complete our meals - all of this at a decent price which is a suprise in this ever expanding neighborhood. A good overall experience and I would definitely come back again for some good comfort food."
9508,28,5,1,11/11/2012,"I should've made this review 2 years ago when Tom's got me hooked for the 1st time. I rave about this place to any and every brooklynite I know, new and old residents. Diner Breakfast just doesn't get any better than Tom's. Serving cookies, beef sausage, and coffee to the anxious people waiting in line? Lemon Ricotta Pancakes? Assorted flavored butters for your pancakes? Jesus Christ how much more close to perfect can you get?? I love Tom's. Everything I've eaten there has been delicious - so I can't recommend one thing in particular. If they ever close (God Forbid) I will begin the memorial vigil. Its that good..Honestly."
9509,28,4,1,10/31/2012,"I love a good omelet, but I hate that gross-greasy feeling you get after eating one too many eggs. Funnily enough, I didn't get that at Tom's despite eating my entire spinach and cheese omelet and plate of home fries. Basically, Tom's is good diner food done right, and with a charm and warmth (Really, what's more welcoming than someone bringing over a plate of whipped cream and cookies and forcing them on you?) that you'd be hard pressed to find anywhere else."
9510,28,5,1,10/29/2012,"This place is really hospitable. We had to wait in line for a table, which wasn't too bad because during the wait, they came by twice, once with cookies to snack on, and once with orange slices. They also gave everyone a glass of water. I got the steak and eggs. The ribeye was GREAT and cooked exactly like I ordered it, medium. The eggs were good. I also made the mistake of ordering a side of bacon. I say mistake because I thought it would have two or three pieces of bacon, not the 6-8 they brought out. While we were eating they came by with orange slices again. I also got a chocolate egg cream soda, which was really good. My food was really good, definitely worth 5 stars. My wife got the chicken chipotle omelette which is what I would get next time, simply because it is something I can't get anywhere else. My wife loved it, but couldn't finish it because of the large portion. I saw at another table someone got eggs florentine which I almost got because it looked so good. The waiter also gave us a cherry limeade on the house, which was also worth ordering. The service was great, my coffee cup was always full. We can't wait to come here again."
9511,28,5,1,10/24/2012,"That is right new york style diner . They serve ˜Best in the area pancakes .. Nice one for breakfast , so if you are fan of american food ˜this is right place )))))))))))"
9512,28,5,1,10/23/2012,"My go-to neighborhood brunch place! This is where I go for amazing pancakes, where I take almost all my out of town guests, and what I crave on a warm sunny day. Some of my favorite menu items are - walnut mango pancakes, corned beef hash, their home made flavored butters, crab cakes, and sweet potato pancakes. These are the only pancakes I've ever had where I don't have to add a single drop of syrup when I eat them! Be prepared for really long lines - this is a popular place. However, while you wait, you will be served orange slices, cookies, slices of ham, and other goodies - Tom's know how to take care of you!"
9513,28,4,1,10/23/2012,Love...Love...Love having Breakfast Here.
9514,28,5,1,10/18/2012,"Decent coffee, pancakes I want to sleep inside of & wake up to eat my way out, perfect homefries, fast service. The place still stands with charm, you can tell it's been around for years serving delicious, fair-priced breakfast to early-morning neighborhood workers and cops."
9515,28,5,1,10/16/2012,"Great service, healthy portions and authentic american breakfast and lunch. Go for the mexican omelette or pancakes, and remember to linger over a cup of coffee in a place where people have taken a break from life for almost a century."
9516,28,4,1,10/14/2012,"as advertised, we went here after a 10k run and it was easy to find, easy to find parking, this place is really small, does not seat many people and there was a line going around the store, its on a corner and we came for brunch, while we were standing outside, we were served FREE oranges, cinnamon pancakes, french fries (which were amazing), honey on bread and coffee (had to pay for coffee), i mean food for standing in line, that's awesome, the wait can be around a half hour if you arrive around 10:30ish, the later you arrive, the longer the wait, when we went in, i had the fish cake and eggs which come with choice of home fries or french fries, my friends had the eggs florentine, eggs with turkey ham and the sausage with eggs, best of all i made their day by bringing them to this place"
9517,28,5,1,10/5/2012,"This review has little to do with the food. It has everything to do with Tom's being a neighborhood institution in a city where that phrase is pretty much dead. I'm not sure why dozens of people line up for hours outside of Tom's each weekend morning. Is it as penance for killing off dozens of similar places in search of the perfect herbed Bellini? Are they curious to know what grocery store whole wheat toast tastes like? Whatever the reason, Tom's is still here as one of the last of its breed. That's a good reward for a business that committed to its neighborhood through a couple of decades when ""enlightened"" people felt a frisson of giddy horror when they rode the 2/3 past Borough Hall. Keep your order simple. Have some pancakes. And grow up (seriously, grow up) if you're bummed out that Tom's coffee isn't like Stumptown's. These places are good for the social fabric of neighborhoods. The vapid consumerism that turns NYC neighborhoods into retail turnstiles isn't."
9518,28,2,1,10/2/2012,"We read the reviews and we thought....this would be a great place for breakfast. ˜ My BF got the Cranberry pancakes....very thick, almost undercooked in the center...lots of food. ˜ I got a burger with fries and it was OK, nothing to write home about..."
9519,28,3,1,10/1/2012,"My friend likes to claim that Tom's is ""the #1 breakfast spot."" Hm. There are plenty of cute and casual diners to be had in New York, and Tom's is just one done right. To speak of diners, yes, this one has everything you love about diners. I definitely had a moment with the generous shrubbery crowding the outisde and the kitschy chaos inside. You have to squeeze along a counter of heavy-handled mugs, heaping plates of eggs, mini tubs of peach/strawberry/cinnamon butter, stacks of pancakes at various states of stuffed and whip-cream-ed in order to get to your vinyl seat and table. The coffee is solid, the portions are generous and the food is exactly what you'd expect. No complaints here, just a good go-to for weekend mornings. My only thing is that my personal love of diners is the 24-hour-factor, and Tom's is open from 8am-4pm. I know I'd like the lemon ricotta pancakes even more at 3am after a night on Franklin."
9520,28,4,1,9/27/2012,"I'm not sure why they call it Tom's - it feel more like going to Grandma's house! From the moment you get in line by the plastic lawn chairs, to when you get seated, Tom's friendly employees are bringing you nibbles, with big happy smiles, and cheering you on as you move up the line past the potted plants. You're constantly having food offered to you, (and since you're in line waiting for a table, Tom's knows how to keep you sated enough to stay in line.) The restaurant is also very kitchy, cozy (read, crowded), and neighborhood friendly. What's not to like? After about 20 minutes in line (and one cookie, two kielbasa, and one orange slice later) we finally made it to a table. My group ordered: - pumpkin walnut pancakes - the 2x2x2 eggs pancakes sausage - turkey melt with fries After about 15 minutes, we received our respective, very large dishes. Everything was tasty. The pancakes were fluffy and came with three kinds of compound butter (cinnamon, strawberry, and marmalade butters). The 2x2x2 was inhaled faster than I thought was possible. And the turkey melt came with stuffing in the sandwich, which was a great add in. The pancakes could have been more pumpkiny and the sandwich a little more moist and well built, but overall the meal was really good, and I'm just nitpicking the details. Service is smiley, but can be brisque, especially if you're sitting in an area out of view. We got everything in time and in order, but I wouldn't recommend Tom's if you're in a rush. And on top of it, the value is fantastic. I would totally make this my neighborhood haunt."
9521,28,5,1,9/25/2012,"This restaurant absolutely lived up to the hype. ˜While the wait can be quite long, they provide you with cookies, water, orange slices and fries. ˜They have anything you want to order and as my dad said he ""hasn't seen a ham steak like that since Wyoming"". ˜Worth the wait and they are accommodating to larger groups. ˜Best part is, you can also order delivery from them! ˜Our food cam pretty fast and hot and the bag was filled with about 12 lollipops. ˜So that was fun."
9522,28,4,1,9/17/2012,This place means business and they are doing a very good job of it. This is one of those places that make you glad you moved to a new neighborhood. Classic diner experience. Good staff and food. Will be back many times. It can get loud. Your sitting pretty tightly but you know that doesn't matter at all when the food comes out.
9523,28,4,1,9/16/2012,"pretty good diner food. ˜simple, straightforward. ˜in and out quick. ˜the line keeps moving. ˜however, completely overrated. ˜people take cabs from manhattan to eat here. ˜it's ridiculous. ˜wait for an overcast day when everyone's assuming it's going to rain and enjoy the food for what it is. ˜love that they'll bring you coffee and bacon as you're waiting in line."
9524,28,5,1,9/13/2012,"I love this place and I can't believe it took moving out of the nabe to finally check it out. With my best friend and her sister in town I wanted to bring to a Brooklyn locale versus the latest foodie write up. There was a line but moved steady and it's true they dole out snacks while you wait. First orange slices, then sausage and lastly fries. When we were seated orders were taken promptly with a smile. I was already settled with the meatloaf and eggs when I saw it on the menu outside. One of my friends got the same and the other the last order of corned beef hash. We got an order of lemon ricotta pancakes for good measure too. I have no complaints just love for tom's. Yes the corned beef hash is canned and the coffe ain't stumptown but the charm of this longtime nabe spot deserves it's 5 stars."
9525,28,5,1,9/13/2012,Tom's. Great dinner food. Can't be beat. My boyfriend and I used to come here all the time when he lived in the neighborhood. Bit of a wait but they provide coffees and things for the people waiting outside. I love their Mexican omelette and pancakes. It's a friendly and unassuming place to eat with your loved ones. I wish they would expand their space so there would be less of a wait.
9526,28,2,1,9/11/2012,"Short & sweet: I had the pancakes with fresh strawberries, bacon, & eggs over easy. They overcooked my eggs. The pancakes were good but $3 for strawberries was a bit much. The space is too small. I chose to sit at the counter as opposed to waiting for a table. That was a big mistake. People kept walking by me bumping into me. Even the waitresses were bumping me. It was extremely annoying. The snacks on the line were tasty though but not enough for me to go back. Nah, i'll pass."
9527,28,3,1,9/6/2012,I wish i could give half stars because I would give a 3.5. Good place for a cheap yet tasty breakfast. The food was well made but some of it just seemed too pre-prepared...but again it was cheap. I got the spinach and feta omelet and that was pretty good. I wouldn't say this place is AMAZING like other people rave about. I dont live in NYC so I am sure if i had some more time to sample the rest of the food I would like it more. My meal was just pretty basic though. They need to clean up a bit too but I understand some people love that old diner ambiance.
9528,28,5,1,9/4/2012,"One of my favorite breakfast spots. The staff is great and friendly, the pancakes are absolutely delicious, and they have great butters to go with them. I never use syrup because they are so flavorful and amazing. ˜There is a reason this restaurant has been around for so long and why the lines are out the door even in the winter. ˜Definitely lives up to the hype!"
9529,28,5,1,9/1/2012,"NOTHING BEATS TOMS! Its not that I live 5 min away or that the diner across the street from my apt. simply STINKS, ( NEPTUNE), ˜its because everything is delicious! This is not an exaggeration! I've been coming to Toms for over a year & I've yet to be disappointed & that's saying a lot! The costumer service is out of this world! ˜ Of course they're not perfect, you may encounter long wait periods & CASH ONLY. There is a ATM in the restaurant! ˜ ˜ Outside of that it's Brunch Heaven!"
9530,28,5,1,8/26/2012,"I just moved to crown heights and have tried almost everything yelp worthy in the neighborhood. The fact is this place is hangover heaven, a god send, you get food while you wait to be seated, the portions are huge, endless coffee, and they have their own hot sauce!!! A good family owned local place--thanks TOMS"
9531,28,5,1,8/20/2012,"This place is STUPID GOOD. ˜If you haven't been here before, I won't completely ruin the surprise, I will say- They give you SNACKS while you wait!!!!!!!!!!! Like, coffee, cookies, orange slices, pieces of sausage or bacon, water, juice. ˜Its a beautiful thing. The wait is usually not bad here, but brunch during rush hour can be sometimes a 45 minute wait. ˜But oh, the snacks. ˜Everything in this place is a pleasure to have and behold, even the waiting. ˜Its also very very old-timey inside. ˜For real, not installed last year. ˜The place is run by the family that has always owned it, since way back in the day and it shows. ˜LOVE IT. GO HERE. Oh and the food is good and very filling and affordable. And everyone that works there is reallllllly nice. They give you lollipops when you leave- WHAT???? DO IT."
9532,28,4,1,8/15/2012,"Driving by on a weekday I saw no line and one lady exiting the diner. ˜Excited I was so I parked on the street and headed in. ˜There was no wait and I got a seat. ˜Normally when eating by myself I had some sort of reading material to keep my eyes occupied. ˜Not needed here, I enjoyed the view the whole time! ˜So cool, the walls ceilings, etc. ˜I felt like I stepped into another time zone and definitely not BROOKLYN New York. ˜Midwest somewhere yes, urban area no! ˜Love this place! The food did not disappoint as well. ˜Bacon, blueberry pancakes and scrambled eggs with a side of homefries is what I had, and it was great! I like this place with the nostalgic, crowded, tie dyed, anything goes type of decorating. ˜There was no wait and everyone inside was so helpful and generally nice. ˜No sour faces or excessive rushing by the waitress which was A+++! I will definitely be back as this diner rightly deserves return visits! -_-!"
9533,28,4,1,8/13/2012,Loved the waiting snaks... Though I did not have any. We loved all that we ordered and got great service. I just wish they fixed things up a bit and cleaned up a bit more.
9534,28,5,1,8/8/2012,"As a newbie to D.C., all I do is brunch and happy hour. So on a weekend trip to BK I was expecting something similar to DC brunch: overpriced, mediocre food with terrible service. I have never been so wrong about anything in my life. I had about a 20 min wait, in which I was given a fresh orange and ice water, cinnamon raisin pancakes, and vinegar fries with horseradish to taste while in line. That, is true customer service. By the time I was seated I had 3 pancakes, and they were the best of my life. Lemon zest and butter. Mind blown. Then I ordered my entr?e - Mexican omelet with a side of bacon. My friends and I sat in silence after the first bites because our lives had been changed. Fresh, hot, home cooking - something you can't find anywhere but at your mom's kitchen, or in this case, Tom's. As if the food wasn't enough, fresh cookies with whipped cream greeted us on our way out. If I ever move to BK - Tom's is going to be my neighbor."
9535,28,4,1,8/8/2012,"The reviews were right, there's definitely going to be a wait to cram you somewhere in the room, but once you're in it feels like you're part of a big family that is ready for some breakfast. Came here with some friends on a Sunday for brunch and we all ordered egg dishes which were humongous. Was there anything crazy special about the eggs? Not really, but you could tell that it was made right there and that it was fresh. Would definitely come back!"
9536,28,5,1,8/5/2012,Cheap and tasty!
9537,28,4,1,7/29/2012,"I'm kind of torn about this place. ˜From a food and service standpoint, this place is great. ˜The girl I was dating at the time broke up with me shortly thereafter eating here with her so I associate Tom's as ""the Last Supper""... oh well. ˜Life goes on."
9538,28,4,1,7/28/2012,"Never fails to please and run by very nice and generous people. While you are waiting for a table during the brunch rush they serve free coffee,lemon/lime ice water, french fries,etc. Excellent breakfast/brunch fare at very fair prices. Love this place!"
9539,28,4,1,7/17/2012,"There are a lot of positives and a share of negs to share about Tom's, but let's start out on a good note. ˜Now I've driven past on multiple Saturdays and seen that scary line waiting outside so I'm glad my only experience has been on a Wednesday for brunch. ˜I did indeed order the recommended staples which include the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Cherry Lime Ricky, as I've never had either anywhere. Now I'm a sucker for lemon flavored anything and these wonderful pancakes did not disappoint. ˜So good! ˜I didn't even use much syrup and the flavored butters they provide make things fun as well. A+ chefery Tom's! ˜The Rickey was rather tasty too, I can just imagine having one with actual alcohol. ˜ Also had a side of eggs which were decent - actually better than at some other diners. ˜ So what went wrong? Well, it was the atmosphere. I expected some kitch, but geez. ˜Still, that was kinda classic. The cheapo tables (this was in the side room since some tourists beat us to a table in the main space - told my gf to stop walking so slow!) kinda bummed me out, especially since we sat at one where a big ol' clock looking thing stuck right out at me. ˜Eh. What wasn't their fault was a family of six, four of those being young children, who were yelling in my ear for 3/4 of my dining experience. ˜I know I'm not a parent, but please don't feed your kids sweets at 11am - they just won't know how to act. ˜I guess for negatives those aren't the worst. All in all, the food is good/decent and very affordable. ˜It's always been n in a good spot, gentrification or not, and I'd be willing to go back there - which means a lot. I was ready to give only 3 stars but then remembered how good the wait staff and owners treated us, so as I tipped them nicely I'll also rate them the same."
9540,28,5,1,7/14/2012,"Constantine is THE MAN. Waited ten minutes in line around 2pm on a Saturday - in those ten minutes, we were fed (free) strawberries, cookies w/ real cream, oranges and coffee. Promptly seated, promptly served. Chocolate chip pancakes and vinegar fries = awesome. And then Constantine sent over a free milkshake for me and my lady to share. You win Tom's. You win."
9541,28,2,1,7/13/2012,I honestly hate this place and hate that it gets such raving reviews. There are sooo many better places to have breakfast and lunch in BK. Now if you're into the whole diner scene then this place works out perfectly for you.
9542,28,4,1,7/13/2012,"Went early on the 4th of July. ˜Waited in a looong, but quickly moving line. ˜While in line, we were offered fresh sliced oranges, ice water, mini pancakes, and turkey ""ham"" by an older gentleman ˜who made us feel very welcomed. ˜Tables are small and nothing is fancy, but the food was good and mostly of the greasy spoon variety. ˜Mexican omlet was delicious and enormous."
9543,28,3,1,7/12/2012,Sweet potato pancakes were great . ˜Wife had corned beef hash. Unfortunately it was out of the can so same taste you get at Toms you can get anywhere. ˜Overall a very good diner with something for everyone. I take off a star cause it is a cash only joint. How do those still exist.
9544,28,3,1,7/8/2012,It was good but not sure if I would come back? the experience is nice but the food so so I had the eggs bennie and my husband the huevos rancheros the plate was huge but wasn't the best brunch i ever had for sure.
9545,28,4,1,6/30/2012,"Mmmmmm. I really like this place. Luckily, I am a teacher and have the entire summer off to go to Tom's and eat pancakes and not have to wait in line during the week. I love the prices here, I love the service, I love the ambience. I had the supreme pancakes with mango, blueberries, and walnuts, but the bite I stole of my friend's sweet potato pancakes was better. Getting that one next time for sure."
9546,28,4,1,6/20/2012,An experience. Crowded at 10 on a Saturday. Had a good time.
9547,28,4,1,6/17/2012,"Went here for the first time yesterday, the food and service was great. ˜The eggs were coated with pancake or waffle batter, the fish cakes came with spicy dipping sauce and the waffles came with flavored strawberry butter & Cinnamon butter the food was Deli-sh!! I'll be back to try more on the menu but don't get the lemonade!! yuck its sugar water but the food is A OK!"
9548,28,4,1,6/16/2012,"Here's a potpourri of Tom's-inspired thoughts. Brunch + Brooklyn Museum = one merry summer afternoon. Crab cakes over spinach and cheese make me very giddy. I wish I enjoyed pancakes because there are so many choices. Lemonade comes in pink. Apparently, ""original"" brooklynites know that an egg cream contains neither egg nor cream, which is why I was so confused. A diner is a diner is a diner, but this one has history and smiles. Thank goodness I have the day off (a Thursday) so I could avoid the line for brunch. Never mind, there is a still a line. Although they do turn the tables over quickly. A parade of various faces that call this neighborhood home."
9549,28,3,1,6/14/2012,"charm, reputation, charisma. despite the buzz, the food and service operates with limited appeal, similarly to any nyc diner, non-organic, small portions, bland coffee, corn syrup, tasteless eggs, overpriced and and only moderately worth the wait... only because it's still a diner... and you're pretty hungry."
9550,28,5,1,6/12/2012,"A legend. The lines move quickly, and you'll be well treated with goodies while you wait. These folks really know how to treat their clientele, even though they don't really have to, given their reputation."
9551,28,5,1,6/4/2012,"Tom's diner was my best dining experience in New York bar none! When visiting New York from Vancouver last summer our local BK friend told us we absolutely had to try Tom's Diner. She's never been more right! Wow, we positively loved it here, the food, the ambiance, the crowed and the history of the venue make it an absolutely necessary stop if you're ever in Brooklyn. Maybe not the best place to count calories but definitely the best spot to go if you're looking for stick to the ribs amazing breakfast or lunch. The Eggs Benedict, the Pancakes, I don't even know where to start - all were absolutely amazing. I especially loved all the different sauces and butters as well, there was a caramel one that went so perfectly with the pancakes yummmmm! The Black & White milkshake really topped off my meal. I don't know how but I finished my entire plate and then tackled some of my girl's. Seriously, if you are ever in the neighborhood and hungry, do yourself a favor and head to Tom's."
9552,28,4,1,6/4/2012,"Fluffy and moist pancakes but the lemon ricotta one is just not my cup of tea. Sorry I have to disagree with other Yelpers on this one. And this isn't just me--Joey didn't fancy it much either. The overwhelming lemon flavor went unappreciated after a few bites. But if you're truly curious about it, then by all means get it but it might be prudent to get one order to share with the entire table. I'd love to go back to try other dishes but I won't be ordering that again. I am so impressed by how this place is run! Customer service here is a model for everyone. I didn't get to see Tom but I heard he likes to go table to table asking how everything is. CASH ONLY but there's an ATM machine right inside the entrance."
9553,28,4,1,6/3/2012,Delicious!! like literally everything was delicious ... may come back tomorrow! One star off for only accepting cash.
7279,28,4,1,5/30/2012,"Tom has one of the most homey brunch! From their outer appearance to their interior design, everything reminds you of home, especially their food! There is always a long line, but it is totally worth it! Try their home-made lemonade, DELICIOUS! I got the crab cakes with 2 sunny side up eggs and home fries. The crabs cakes were so yummy, with big lumps of meat. The eggs are all organic. I am not very into homes fries, so to me they seem to be regular. My friend got Eggs Benedict poached eggs on english muffin with ham and hollandaise sauce and home fries. I tried some of the hollandaise sauce and it was so yummy! He finished the rest of the dish s couldn't try any even if I wanted to! I think for food, you really have to read through yelpers to see what you should order. It's always a hit or miss with breakfast food."
9554,28,2,1,5/27/2012,Maybe I'm a food snob but after Clinton Street's pancakes Toms pancakes were not delicious like so many of you claimed. I don't know I guess I expected better.
9555,28,3,1,5/27/2012,"Toms is ok food but priced very well. I would never wait in line,MIT amazes me every weekend when I pass all the people, but they always seem to be happy and having fun with each other. Inside is cute old style diner. Staff are fast not overly friendly, but they get the job done. It's very kid friendly and if you have people that like eggs and other that like sweet, you have a lot to choose for both. I wouldn't get the extra fruit if you get pancakes or waffles got frozen strawberries once, hmmm yum :-/ Worth trying, but not the best around"
9556,28,4,1,5/25/2012,"Pros: the pancakes and flavored butters are excellent and the vibe is awesome! Cons: everything else. Long waits on Saturday and Sunday to get a table, and let's face it, this is just diner food people."
9557,28,1,1,5/21/2012,"I'm beginning to lose trust in the taste buds of my fellow Brooklyn Yelpers... This place was SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT! The bf and I decided to go to Tom's for brunch yesterday. The food was TERRIBLE! This is how it went down: Let's begin with the syrup...the moment I began pouring I noticed the thick glue like consistency and it immediately grossed me out, I couldn't believe one can gag with syrup, well I did...oh and it was also tasteless. The french toasts looked like they had been pressed by an iron --I have no idea why. I took my first bite and that was the last, the french toasts were extremely hard and tasted old, just like the bacon and the syrup. The bacon was far from crunchy, instead it was hard and even difficult to chew. The scramble eggs were burnt and DRY! The cinnamon and banana pancakes were too doughy and only had 2 slices of bananas per pancake. The guy who took our order and never came back to our table, oh yea, I think you call those waiters, did not wait on us at all, we had to ask someone else for our bill. Total bad experience, $25 down Tom's diners drain. We will never bother to come back. Oh and that ""only cash"" deal is just inconvenient, stop being cheap and take credit cards, it's 2012!!!"
9558,28,5,1,5/19/2012,"These were, the most, amazing PANCAKES OF MY LIFE! ˜I dreamt of them every single day we were in New York. I will savor my picture of them forever. Lemon ricotta all the way!"
9559,28,2,1,5/18/2012,"I totally do not understand the reviews. ˜Granted, it's cool that they give you coffee and snacks while you wait in line - I hate waiting for breakfast - but that doesn't make up for the terrible, overpriced food and forgettable atmosphere. ˜I've given Tom's a few tries but I won't be back."
9560,28,5,1,5/18/2012,This place is special. There aren't many breakfast places that have food that matches the awesomeness of it's eclectic decor. This is one of the rare winners. I got the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes...they were fluffy and the the hint of lemon made them different from just a good pancake. Great. I also loved that the coffee cup they gave me was a huge mug. I hate the little cups that some of these run of the mill joints give you. Great coffee too. The decor was a mashup of hilarious failed actors head shots and weird paintings. Absolutely loved it. Don't think it's on purpose but I bet every Brooklyn hipster loves that stuff and thinks that it is on purpose. It was worth the hour and a half train ride. And that says a freaking lot.
9561,28,1,1,5/17/2012,"Why in the world does this place have such great reviews? I came here today based solely on the reviews and am NEVER going back. don't get me wrong service was great, I was alone and didn't feel rushed although they were busy, everyone was attentive. But the food... oh god the food, can you even really call it that? I don't know if the chef was hungover and pregnant but it tasted horrible. I ordered the cinnamon pancakes and they were as heavy as the weights I use at the gym, not fluffy at all contrary to the reviews below. French fries were greasy. just no, and worst of all I ordered lemonade and they came back with this pink concoction that tasted like pink flavored sugar water, there was no hint of lemon acidity in my mouth people! Never again. ever...."
9562,28,4,1,5/15/2012,"I've been going to Tom's since I was a child. ˜I used to always look forward to those cookies they would serve while you're waiting for your food...I digress... ˜I think Toms is a good neighborhood breakfast spot. ˜I can't speak for anything else other than their breakfast menu items. ˜It's not the best but it's certainly not the worst. ˜The omelettes are always good and the pancakes are pretty good as well. The one thing that would keep me coming back it's that cinnamon butter..delicious! It does get crowded but they seem to move things along pretty well so you never feel like you've waited forever. ˜If you need a good pick-me up well-priced breakfast, Tom's will not dissapont."
9563,28,5,1,5/15/2012,"Decided to try this place as I was craving a hamburger ( well veggie burger), and followed others reviews and went to Tom's. ˜ Great lively atmosphere, and everybody was friendly and very inviting. ˜Even though I placed a to-go order ( it was a great day out side and went to the park) the customer service is amazing. The food was great! I need to come back and try the breakfast menu next time."
9564,28,5,1,5/6/2012,This was the best place i think i have ever eaten at...i loved it so much and i loved the location because i lived in prospect heights for years..everyone is very nice and the food is great...i love you guys!
9565,28,5,1,5/4/2012,"Did someone say Breakfast? ˜Anyone? ˜Somebody please? OK, if you have read my reviews (if not start) I'm not one for eating breakfast on vacation. ˜Why? you may ask. ˜Because if I'm up early enough to eat breakfast I didn't drink enough the night before. ˜So understand how good Tom's is. ˜I eat breakfast here every morning when I'm in New York. Ive been coming here for years and there somethings that are consistent. ˜The wait, the crowd and the food. ˜Also, the inappropriate conversations we partake in at the breakfast table. I always come inhere wanting to experience some new food and I seem to always get drawn by some sort of all-inclusive combo. ˜I'm a sucker for a combo. ˜But they have a crab cake benedict that is too die for. ˜And they always bring oranges and cookies. ˜I love it here, Tom you are my friend. I HEART TOM (Tom, can I get something free next time?)"
9566,28,4,1,4/24/2012,"Thankfully no wait when my husband and I got there. ˜Came here to try the infamous lemon ricotta pancakes, but after seeing the pastrami and eggs at the nearby table, I changed my mind. ˜Pastrami was so flavorful and tender, nicely paired with over-easy eggs and home fries. ˜Husband got the eggs florentine (as also spotted at the nearby table), perfectly smothered in eggs and cheese grits. ˜Also delicious! Service was quick and warm, nice homey environment. Definitely a place to bring visiting friends! And don't forget... CASH ONLY, so plan ahead :)"
9567,28,4,1,4/24/2012,Tasted pretty good on the first try my girlfriend wasn't satisfied with the steak because it tasted of too much charcoal. The flavor of the meat was overpowered by the taste of the grill. My meal on the other hand was great. Will try again.
9568,28,4,1,4/21/2012,"I went early Saturday morning and it was full inside, but we were seated right away. ˜I ordered pancakes and my bf ordered omelet, hashbrowns and toast. ˜The fluffy pancakes were delicious!! I was expecting the worse. ˜I couldn't finish all but we definitely agreed were going back for breakfast again."
9569,28,4,1,4/19/2012,"The appeal of this restaurant is equal parts old school and very satisfying meals. My friends and I went one morning with some brutal hangovers and the food there did just the trick. As people who love to share our meals, I tried three different dishes, all of which were very good. I had the corned beef hash with home fries. It was ginormous and corned beef hash was excellent. One friend got the crab cakes with an AMAZING hot sauce. If you order this dish, make sure you get that on the side! Another friend got the huevos rancheros, which were pretty standard. Of course, they were not as good as the ones I get on vacation in NM and AZ, but for east coast huevos, they cut the mustard. The service here is great! Very quick and not overly attendant. Water and coffee never went empty."
9570,28,2,1,4/17/2012,"In a word, overrated."
9571,28,2,1,4/5/2012,"With the constant lines out the door as well as amazing reviews my expectations were pretty high. I think that's the problem is the Internet these days. If I was passing by, or was in the area and went in without any expectations I would maybe give it three stars. My experience was that of any old run of the mill diner. I didn't taste anything extra ordinary, it was a basic pretty decent breakfast. I think the hype is involved with the quirkiness of the place. I mean for one there's not a lot of places around that area to get a good breakfast and secondly it still has that old school rustic neighborhood diner feel to it, which is why I think it's rating is so high. It reminds you of 'old school Brooklyn'. Being a brooklynite my whole life I can tell you , it's worth trying so you can scratch it off your bucket list but I didn't think it was 5 star worthy. The waitstaff was very quick and helpful. Go on a weekday when there isn't a line, I would feel bad if you had to wait on a long line for that."
9572,28,4,1,4/2/2012,"my outlook on breakfast has once again been changed in bk. i seriously blacked out while eating the pastrami and eggs. behind the shirt rib hash at stone park cafe (not too far behind), it is the 2nd best breakfast I've had. the pastrami had the perfect crispy-juicy-salty-tender ratio. the portion was humongous but I couldn't let a scrap go to waste. the lemon pancakes are a good deal too. the restaurant itself is very homey. feels like your eating in grandmas kitchen or porch depending on where you end up sitting. this place lost a star because of the cash only policy and weird seating arrangements. also the waiter forgot a few things, so i had to keep asking for stuff. besides that, I had no complaints, especially regarding the food."
9573,28,3,1,4/2/2012,"for me, my breakfast was ok and i think its a little overrated. i had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which are good but i am not one to ever think pancakes will ever be life changing. hash browns were so dry. and the sausage was just ok - a little dry too. i did like the flavored butter that came with the pancakes. my bf had the pastrami and egg whites which were amazing. the pastrami was crispy and juicy and the eggs were the perfect compliment. the seating it very tight - but i was seated under a picture frame where i kept hitting my head on it. they shouldnt have a table there since i am very short and still kept hitting my head on it. i probably will stay in park slope if i want a good breakfast."
5433,28,3,1,3/31/2012,"..Tom's is a Prospect Heights diner classic..the interior is fun, playful..an assortment of randomness collected over time with character..its cheap with great brunch options and several different kinds of pancakes to choose from..if you're in the neighborhood stop in..but if its a weekend, swing by after 1:30 or so..they stay packed."
9574,28,5,1,3/31/2012,"One of the best breakfast spots in the city. Wide variety, daily specials and generous portions. Always prompt and friendly service, and it's a great location. Unfortunately since they've achieved a Zagat rating some years ago it's gotten ridiculously popular, so it can get really crowded, especially on the weekend. However, these guys are really fast and efficient, so even when it is crowded the wait doesn't tend to be long. Been coming here for a long time, and I'm still a fan."
9575,28,3,1,3/29/2012,"If it wasn't for their exceptional pancakes I would have given Tom's a 2 star review. The place is nice and cosy. After my boyfriend and I read all these great reviews, we decided to give it a try as we live close. The decor is quite nice and to our surprise my boyfriend also spotted a picture on the wall that his dad took back in the 60's. Alright, so when we received our menus, it was sort of hard to make a decision but we went for the famous lemon ricotta pancakes that everyone is raving about. These were AWESOME. They were sooooo fluffy.. However, my bacon cheeseburger was bland plus my bacon came on a plate instead of on my burger. The bacon was dry. I didn't eat it. Big disappointment. I am a bacon whore. I also had mac&cheese which they only serve on Fridays so my expectations were high. Again, a disappointment. It was plain old Kraft Mac&Cheese deluxe. I have no idea idea why they only serve this on Fridays. The boyfriend ordered onion rings (which were gigiantic) and steak and eggs. I am not going to comment on that as I didnt taste his food. He liked it. He's not a foodie though lol. My pineapple juice tasted bad. I expected freshly squeezed juice which I did not get. To conclude: I will return, but for pancakes only. I can do a better job at making my own bacon cheeseburger and mac & cheese."
9576,28,3,1,3/20/2012,"2.5 stars but rounded up. It's very cheap. And if your priority is saving money then I'd come here and feel good about it. It's a notch above a bad diner but a notch below a good one. The butter, the syrup, the fruit, none of it is high quality. It's all off the sisco truck. The eggs are fine. The fries are delicious. The waffles, the pancakes all of it are fine. Not worth any kind of wait. The decor is fun, but only out of context. This diner is the restaurant version of a hipster. Turning a lack of funds into a really cool thing and making people think its all a choice. I think this was at one time genuine, but now is played up for the hispterati that come here instead of a fancier brunch option, because you know, it's by choice. But really, the quality is not there. I would return, on a weekday, if I was in the mood for a greasy spoon and was in the area. Waiting hours is just nuts. I'm sorry Tom's. I think you mean well."
9577,28,5,1,3/18/2012,"I love Tom's! ˜Their pumpkin pancakes are to-die-for and service is super fast and friendly. ˜They are always jam-packed but they never hover or make you feel like you need to leave. I always order the chili omelette with grits - their grits are fantastic! ˜Their coffee is very strong, great for a hangover, which is honestly when I usually go to Tom's. The pricing is reasonable and it's a great place to take visitors out if you don't mind waiting. ˜But even being in line at Tom's is a pleasure since they bring orange slices, strawberries, cookies and sausage bites to the people waiting in line!"
9578,28,5,1,3/15/2012,Oh Tom's! You were one of the highlights of NY! :) Your breakfast hit the spot in many ways! The decor was interesting but totally cute in many ways! Your service was spectacular and the wait was no wait at all! You make breakfast time super cozy and enjoyable! I took a trip to NY with a couple of girls and one of our stops was Brooklyn. We had a day to wonder around and enjoy the town. It was great! But boy we were hungry! We yelped places to eat at and this was one that looked pretty tasty! We were RIGHT! Tom's! Your breakfast was soo tasty! Eggs Benedict with fluffy potatoes! A side of cornbeef hash to wash it down! It was worth the crazy walk through the cold! Great service! Friendly to all our request! I remember the bathroom was a bit small! But hey! Still.. you were good! :)
9579,28,3,1,3/11/2012,"I mean it's a diner, right, so you can't really say anything bad. ˜Still, I would have liked my coffee refilled faster and the Splenda on the table before or at the same time the coffee is poured. ˜Otherwise, always delicious and fast even on a crowded Saturday when ALL the HIPSTERS invade this place for their fill of pancakes and eggs. ˜I wish the SMOKERS were more considerate and moved their pow wow around the corner away from the restaurant door."
9580,28,5,1,3/8/2012,"Onion rings, walnut pancakes, and a chocolate shake accompanied by genuinely friendly wait staff and truly strange decor couldn't make me happier on a Sunday morning when I'm on the hunt for a decidedly unpretentious, Brooklyn brunch. Thank you, Tom's. I am still full."
9581,28,4,1,3/4/2012,"Don't let the line deter you from Tom's. ˜It's well worth the wait, especially since it moves pretty quickly. ˜For two people, we only waited about 10 minutes. ˜ Tom's was exactly what I was hoping for- just a simple diner with good breakfast and lunch options. ˜Their breakfast items sounded good, and they have a ton of omlettes, but I was looking for a sandwich. ˜Tried the brisket with gravy on the side. ˜My friend had the turkey club with french fries and we got a side of cole slaw. ˜The cole slaw was refreshing and really good- not too mayo-ey. ˜The brisket is lean so a bit on the dry side. ˜Spooning some gravy on it moistened it up nicely. ˜The turkey club was your average good turkey club. ˜Their fries are good, especially when you dip them in their special chipotle tasting like spicy mayo sauce! ˜ If I could give an extra half star for service, I would. ˜They are SO sweet there. ˜Fast, efficient, but NICE. ˜I asked the waiter what this Cherry Lime Ricky was that everyone raves about, and he described it as Sprite with Shirley Temple syrup, which did not sound appetizing to me, so I declined. ˜But he was nice enough to bring both of us a glass of it to try on the house, and it tasted much better than I thought it would! ˜ Overall, solid place to go for a cheap, filling, friendly diner."
9582,28,4,1,3/3/2012,Food is great here. Me and my girlfriend love this place...they have wide variety of pancakes...service is fast...the only problem is the lines at this place on the weekend but they at least they make an effort to make your comfortable while you wait...it is also a bit small in there (hence the 4 stars) but I would recommend this place to anybody who loves a traditional American breakfast
9583,28,3,1,2/25/2012,The brunch was good. I liked the different flavors of butter you can get with pancakes. My favorite was the cinnamon flavored butter. The spicy mayo was also tasty with the fries. Just didn't like that the line is so long to wait to get seated and the place is kind of cramped. It was nice of them to feed you while you are waiting. Makes the time go by a bit faster. More places should do that! :)
9584,28,4,1,2/18/2012,"My finance and I went here for brunch today, and we loved it! It was decorated like a typical diner. Very cute with interesting things on the wall. Okay so the service was GREAT! While we waited in line to be seated the staff came through the line several times with different samples for everyone waiting to taste. We were offered sausage (it was yum), coffee, oranges, cookies, and french fries with a chipotle dipping sauce. Yes all those hot samples offered within our 15-20 minute wait! How nice is that! So once we were seated we were given water immediately and our menus were on the table waiting for us. The menu is huge and they have a variety of pancakes! It's like a pancake lovers dream world!!!! They had cranberry pancakes, cinnamon pancakes, banana walnut pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes. I had sweet potato pancakes and they were really good! My bacon was mediocre. They also have a variety of butters, including caramel, cinnamon, and strawberry! AWESOME! My Fiance had a Belgian waffle and spread the cinnamon butter on it. She enjoyed it. Our waiter was so funny and gave us great service! My fiance and I went back and forth about order the famous ""Cherry Lime Ricky"" and ended up getting coke. Our waiter tried to convince us that it was good but we were too concerned. So when he delivered our cokes he surprised us with a Cherry Lime Ricky on the house! So nice of him and the cherry lime Ricky was very good! My fiance's words, ""it taste like summer."" While we were eating the manager came around and asked guest how their meals were. You don't get that service everyday in nyc. This place was great. The food is good, the service is awesome, and it's cheap! You get the bang for your buck!!! I will be back many times! :-) We ˜were so pleased we left a 25% tip. p.s. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because it had a ""B"" grade for health inspection. I have no idea what a ""B"" means so I was reluctant to give 5 stars. But as you can see that didn't stop me from having a great experience."
9585,28,5,1,2/11/2012,this breakfast is banging.
9586,28,5,1,2/2/2012,"Headed here after a race in Prospect Park, so we were there on the early side and got a table within five minutes...which might be a shame because I hear they bring you pancakes while you wait in line. Anyway, we had a ""big group"" (what they kept referring to us as...) of five people, and we all enjoyed our meals. ˜The banana walnut pancakes were definitely my favorite, and they give ˜you three different butters to smother on your pancakes and toast. If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd probably be back more often, but definitely a good excuse to find more races in Prospect Park!"
9587,28,4,1,1/31/2012,"love it here!!!!!! love everything about it! sometimes I think the prices are a little high considering its just basic diner food, but i think they can get away with it because people love the place so much. I know I do! it's a special breakfast treat to come here :) all the butters are fantastic and I love the lollipops."
9588,28,2,1,1/27/2012,One word: overrated.
9589,28,4,1,1/23/2012,"The food is absolutely delicious! The faves are banana pancakes, Rueben sandwiches, crab cakes and egg cream. And you definitely should try their signature Cherry Lime Rickey. Food, host, and service are amazing. The only thing stopping me from giving it a perfect score is the tightness of the space. Enjoy the autographed celebrity photos."
9590,28,4,1,1/15/2012,"I hit this spot up every Saturday for breakfast. Best item on the menu is the crabcakes florentine, but they go a bit too heavy on the hollondaise, so I order it on the side. Throw in a beef sausage with a slice of lemon and a chocolate egg cream and it's heaven. Great wait staff. Love it."
9591,28,5,1,1/14/2012,"I'm adding to the noise here by saying that EVERYTHING is good. We always recommend to our guests to make the half mile walk here. No one has ever been disappointed. It is just so, so good. I can't get enough. We did have one waitress a couple of weeks ago who kept coming back to ask if we were finished... while we still had 1/3 of a plate left. She seemed a little bit perturbed that we wanted all of the food and she couldn't take the plates. Doesn't bother me though... she has probably worked there for 20 years and this isn't some pretentious hipster place. It is a DINER and I like it that way :) Try the Danish Pancakes. Or the omelets. Or the Challah French Toast (COME ON!) Cash only. ATM on site. Don't be dismayed by the long lines-- They bring you FOOD! And WATER! They take care of you to lighten the burden of waiting 30 minutes. Think of it this way: empty restaurants normally mean the customers don't keep coming back. What does it say about this place. I shouldn't have written this review. I'm going to have to go tomorrow now :("
9592,28,3,1,1/8/2012,"I love classic diners so when I was doing research on what was near the Brooklyn Museum of Art and this came up I figured we should definitely try it. Luckily we beat a long wait (and probably missed one) and got seated right a way. The danish pancakes were just like normal pancakes but with lemon zest and blueberries. Fluffy and lemony, pretty good. All the butter options were nice. Glad I tried it but won't be running back."
9593,28,4,1,1/5/2012,"The food is not anything to flip over backwards for but the service you receive here is. I ordered 2 cinnamon pancakes and 1 chocolate chip pancake to be honest I think iHop pancakes are better. I also ordered a turkey sausage and was said when the waiter showed up with my food and there was only one sausage which cost an extra $2.50. But I finished my food before everyone at my table. My waiter was sitting at a table not to far from me eating his lunch and heard me say this and looked dead at me. I thought he was going to ask if there was anything else I'd like to order but he didn't. He kept looking at me so I told him not to worry and finish his lunch but he jumped up and said, ""If your still hungry I'll fix that"". He bought me out a Belgium waffle and said it was on the house. ˜I thought that was so sweet. Of course I could only eat one of the four sections but it was the thought that counts. Solely because of the great customer service I rate thus place a four. The food is average."
9594,28,1,1,1/3/2012,"Awful. I can't even believe some of these ratings. Thought this would be good based on reviews but it wasn't even good for a diner. Dont waste your time its not worth the wait or the hype. And you may be thinking something like ""how can they screw up diner food""...well that's exactly what me and my friend thought but they managed to do so. Take it from a girl who loves Waho...this is WORSE. My friend got an omelet...an omelet and she didn't finish it! Cannot stress this enough!"
9595,28,5,1,12/31/2011,"Just moved to Prospect Heights, and to our delight, Tom's is one block from our place. The wait on the weekend at noon was long. But they ply you with cookies, bacon, coffee, sausages, and more, and provide seats and music. I must have done something right in a past life because divine providence prompted me to order the lemon ricotta pancakes with fresh strawberries on top, and a side of the smoked sausage. Outlandishly good. We barely spoke during the meal. Also highly recommend the cherry lime rickey."
9596,28,5,1,12/30/2011,"My friend was visiting and declared she wanted pancakes, good American pancakes. ˜A quick search of the neighbourhood turned up Tom's. And for once Jet lag was a good thing as we got there with only a queue of 4 people ahead of us and were seated in 10mins. And yep - the reviews are correct. I'm not a huge fan of American pancakes but the Danish Blueberry, Lemon and Ricotta are light fluffy and moreish, especially with the caramel butter (who dreamt up that sin?!). And as others have said, as a diner experience it can't be beaten. I'll be back for more."

9598,28,5,1,12/26/2011,"Sometimes the best surprises can be right around the corner! Saturday morning on my last trip to NYC, my friend had to work. I took this alone time as an opportunity to explore her neighborhood alone. Two blocks from her apartment is Tom's. The diner itself has very little seating, so be prepared for a long wait on weekend mornings. I only had about an hours worth of time, so I opted for take out and ate my breakfast at Prospect Park. I had the pastrami with eggs, home fries, and toast. Man, was this good. The lunch box was filled to the brim and I've never seen such generous helpings of pastrami. ˜All this for $8.50 is a steal. The pastrami was packing so much flavor and the potatoes were seasoned well. The best part about Tom's is that it's a local's joint and they treat their costumers well. You might have to wait 30 min to an hour in line, but they'll bring you snacks and coffee while you wait."
9599,28,5,1,12/26/2011,"Classic diner. Food, service and atmosphere is consistent. The best of the best when it comes to Brooklyn diners. Don't expect a culinary masterpiece. Because it's a diner. Expect excellence in the context of diners and you will leave with a big fat smile on your face! If you don't want to wait in a long line, Don't go on the weekend. If you want a fancy brunch, Go somewhere else. If you want a bacon egg and cheese on a sesame bagel, Look no further."
9600,28,4,1,12/18/2011,"We popped by before a taking a leisurely relaxing walk through the Brooklyn Botanical Garden. Waiting in line for 40 minutes was nirvana, since they served us fresh bacon and other goodies while we patiently stood in line! This is the part you must read, and (*this is important!*) you must take action. Come here, and try the lemon ricotta pancakes. Just do it. They blew me away! My wife, who ordered another tasty item was quite jealous as I tried so hard to avoid scarfing the entire dish down myself. Sorry dear! Consumer warning: walking for miles through a botanical garden on a warm day, with a stomach full of ricotta pancakes, turns out to be quite challenging. Damn, that was a lot of food! ""You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough."" (Mae West)"
9601,28,4,1,12/11/2011,"For Mimsye Belle and me, it was $35 for breakfast on our first visit. Maybe it was because I mentioned we were newbies, or Mimsye's got more charm than a football stadium full of cheerleaders; either way, we had fantastic service. Mimsye had the mango and walnut pancakes with a side of pork sausage. I had Harvest Pancakes - sweet corn and cranberries - with eggs over easy. These were excellent pancakes. The specialty butters, strawberry, caramel, and cinnamon, was a nice touch. We ordered maple syrup. The sausages were much better than most and nicely prepared because they were split and grilled on the open side, giving them a little crunch on the finish. The setting is charming. Props to the three servers that paid attention to us, and Gus for assuring everything was excellent and giving us valuable advice about another local business."
9602,28,5,1,12/9/2011,my favorite breakfast place. The line out the door is worth it especially because they serve you snacks while you wait. The whipped iced coffee is fantastic as well as there never ending selection of pancakes. The best thing on the menu though is the beef sausage with lemon on it. Just go and try it already.
9603,28,5,1,12/7/2011,"The Platonic ideal of a diner, and classic Brooklyn to boot. Let me be more specific, because I'm seeing some disappointed reviews on Yelp: Tom's is not a stylish, gourmet resto. TOM'S IS A DINER. You are going to be eating meatloaf on a formica table with crumbs from the previous diners, and if you don't put in your order within the first three seconds of the waiter showing up at your table, the waiter's walking away. If you're looking for fresh flowers, sweet-faced waitresses, and bulgur wheat waffles with locally-sourced honey, go to Vanderbilt Avenue or something. Tom's is for reals. I'm always in the mood for something different when I eat at Tom's, so I don't have specific dishes to recommend. However, I always augment my order with fries and a cherry lime rickey. I don't know if you've ever had the latter, but at Tom's, it's a refreshing, not-too-sweet, fizzy way to cut the (yummy) diner grease. It's also great for a hangover. Just sayin'. As for the fries, every time I bring a newcomer here, I warn 'em: the aioli for the fries is very spicy. Scoffs abound, but after dipping about three fries into the fiery orange sauce, the amateur has tears in his or her eyes. I warned you."
9604,28,3,1,12/3/2011,"Decent breakfast all day place. ˜Feels old school and you can tell there are a lot of regulars. ˜This place came recommended and it was pretty good breakfast food, but I don't see making a special trip. ˜They make a lot of staples that are hard to eff up so if we lived around the corner, I can see us there all the time, but nothing to write home about."
9605,28,3,1,12/3/2011,Great looking old school diner with soda fountain from the 30's. They still have lime rickeys and egg creams. Get there around 9AM before the monster line forms to gets in. The crab cake florentine is terrific but the egg specials are just standard and the home fries are better at most places. It's still worth it for the unique atmosphere and reasonable prices.
9606,28,3,1,11/26/2011,"Oy! ˜I kinda feel like a traitor for not raving about this place, but I'm letting my belly do the reviewing. ˜I certainly get the lure of this place; It's been around forevs and survived gentrification which is a huge feat. ˜The staff though quite rushed are still very friendly, and of course the kitschy decorations are seriously charming. But the food. ˜The food. Is just ok. The prices are great but I just don't think the food is that remarkable. My sister and I both had the pancakes and our cousin had the omelette and we all felt that the food was good but not great. ˜Sorry. ˜I'm gonna have to get all Benedict Arnold with these Eggs Benedict."
9607,28,3,1,11/26/2011,"My boyfriend insisted we try the place with 'the long ass line where the staff gives you cookies and oranges' so I had to do my part and give in. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with bacon and it was delicious. He ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and a mexican omelete that looked scrumptious. He did not complain. ˜ The service; though friendly, felt rushed. Overall, ˜I will return, but I'm not sure if it worth the hassle of the long line in a cramped space."
9608,28,4,1,11/23/2011,good food. really good coffee. had the spinach and cheese omelet. my friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes. my only ding is that they brought my friend's food out like 10 minutes after mine! yeah i'd probably go back.
9609,28,3,1,11/15/2011,"I went there just because one of my friends said their world's famous pancake are the best in Brooklyn. ˜That's true, it is the best in BROOKLYN. ˜We also order omlete and French Toast. ˜They are only ""OKAY"". ˜Will I come back? ˜Hum.... If I need to drive all the way to there, the answer probably is ""NO"". ˜But for those who live near by, should definitely give it a try. ˜The famous Lemonade just taste like my cold medicine. Coffee are taste like water."
9610,28,3,1,11/14/2011,"had the lemon ricotta pancakes and I was excited!! But I didn't love it. ˜It was alright. However there was a very long line to get in and I've never seen people be as nice as them! ˜They brought out coffee, toast, cookies to people in line. ˜That just doesn't happen so I was impressed. ˜The food looked good, restaurant was typical diner, very nice staff.... food definitely wasn't bad, but not great either."
9611,28,3,1,11/13/2011,"Environment and look and feel are great. ˜Food nothing really special, which is a huge disappointment. ˜Service was also not so great."
9612,28,4,1,11/1/2011,"What a fun place; prices are good, food is tasty, and the space is comfortable. The wait is usually long on the weekends, but don't worry because those folks will march up and down the line with orange slices, bread, and sausage to soothe waiting patrons' hunger pangs. Worth a trip from Harlem."
9613,28,5,1,10/30/2011,"Mango pancakes, Cherry-Lime Ricky, eggs over medium, beef sausage, toast, grits and oh steak lol! ˜Can you tell this is my favorite breakfast spot in all of New York despite the long line? ˜When my family comes to visit, we go two days in a row!"
9614,28,3,1,10/29/2011,"I don't feel guilty giving Tom's 3 stars because it's not like they're a struggling business; they do really, really well for the crowd that they're catering to. I came here when I realized, to my devastation, that The Islands were closed, and desperately looked on Yelp for a decent place to take my boyfriend who was visiting for a few days. Yelp didn't fail me - it certainly was charming and adorable (there's a LOT of attention given to the d?cor and ambiance), but I definitely think it was overpriced. The things that I was excited for - the free cookie & orange slices and homemade butters - were simply mediocre; they generically distributed the cookies and orange slices and it didn't make me feel special or anything. It just felt weird. The homemade butters were not very spectacular. They were alright, but they were just ... butters. I couldn't really taste what they were (except for the cinnamon). We got the pumpkin walnut waffle, which was admittedly pretty decent. We shared it and were both pretty full, so I guess it wasn't too terribly expensive, but I really did not see what the hype was about."
9615,28,5,1,10/20/2011,"Toms is one of a kind. My favorite thing about this place is standing outside online waiting to go in. By the time you get seated you've had a cup of coffee, a cookie, some orange slices...yes, the staff bring these out to you while you're waiting on line. Cash only, but it's worth the non use of the swiping your card convenience. The food and atmosphere just make you feel like home. Breakfast anytime of day, already a plus and you get a definite bang for your buck. You leave Tom's satisfied with enough change to catch an afternoon movie or museum (Brooklyn Museum is right up Washington Avenue) stroll. This is a great first date or getting to know each other place. The use of cell phones is discouraged and you have plenty of time to talk while waiting on line or enjoying your meal."
9616,28,3,1,10/19/2011,"What the hell is this line? About 20 deep in the store and no one is complaining? ˜How can this be? Bribery, that's how. While you wait in line, they ply you with fruit, cookies, meats, gold, diamonds... Ok. ˜Maybe not the last two. ˜ By the time we were seated, I was nearly full. ˜But that didn't stop me from having an entire plate of cheese fries washed down with a root beer float. ˜Yes, these are not what Tom's is known for but it was what I was craving. ˜Unfortunately, I found my order to be only borderline satisfactory. ˜The cheese was kind of cold and congealed and the fries appeared to come from a brown bag that can be found in freezers across American diners. ˜But fries covered in cheese is never a bad thing unless your a cardiologist. ˜ What I should have gotten was the pancakes with lemon ricotta. ˜That sounds like it would make you wanna slap yo' mama. ˜ What you should not get is the fishcake. ˜They are strange in texture and resemble neither fish nor cake. ˜The sauce they came with was pretty decent. ˜I enjoyed dipping my fries in it. I think the food was 2-star worthy but the service really bumps this place up to the 3rd star. ˜Even after we were seated and eating, the friendly people of Tom's would not stop shoving free samples in my face. ˜And I love free anything! ˜Spicy cucumbers, orange slices, more chocolate chip cookies! Oh my! Maybe I'm just not all that impressed by diner food in general (except when I'm really drunk/hungover) but I still think Tom's is a really unique experience that leaves you with a smile. Cheeeeeese. (but hopefully not the congealed kind.)"
9617,28,5,1,10/18/2011,"For my birthday brunch a friend of mine says 'Let's check out Toms Restaurant. It has pretty good Yelp reviews and it's easy to get to (it was Sunday - we all know how the MTA runs on Sunday)... the only downside is that there is usually a line' Since I wasn't in a rush and almost always eager to try something new we took a shot... O-M-G... I'm in love. Yes there was a line. No we did NOT: A. have to pay for the coffee we got while waiting in said line, or for the cookies, French Fries, Oranges, or Turkey Ham (with Lemon which was delicious and I would have never thought of trying it if it hadn't been free) B. wait that long, maybe a half hour -- PLUS they gave everyone in line hand sanitizer so that while you handled your cookie, orange, etc your paws weren't all grubby. The staff was amazing. We met the GM, Billy (I think that's his name) while we were waiting in line and he casually asked us what we did for a living... he then introduced us to another employee who had some connections in our industry... wow most NYC restaurant GMs don't take the time to say Hello and here they are giving away coffee and networking. The food is inexpensive and very tasty. I say give them a go - but if sleek decor and fancy food is what your heart desires than this is not your kind of place."
9618,28,4,1,10/13/2011,"My friends and I went here for brunch. ˜The place is very small so you may have to wait in line for awhile. ˜I wouldn't recommend a bigger group than 3 which we had because the booths are back when and they're tiny! I ordered pumpkin walnut Belgian waffles, my friends ordered it in the pancake and we had an omelette with home fries. The waffle was good, I just wish I would taste a little bit more pumpkin. ˜But nonetheless it was good. ˜But oh my, the fries! ˜It's so yummy! ˜It's freaking addicting! ˜It reminds me of the Denny's fries but more home made and bigger. Overall, a legit, diner in Brooklyn :) ˜Definitely a place for brunch time with friends because you know, we never wake up in time for breakfast! OH YEAH! ˜CASH ONLY!"
9619,28,5,1,10/11/2011,"Thumbs way up! Kitschy atmosphere, delicious menu, old school prices. Definitely a neighborhood favorite. My best advice is to come in a group of 2 (4 MAX) and arrive early i.e. before 11am on the weekends. It's very small inside, so the line can get up to 30 deep, butttt they do come around with samples to keep the line-standers happy :) I ordered the eggs florentine, but next time I want to try the pancakes with homemade compound butter. The sweet potato and lemon ricotta pancakes look especially good :)"
9620,28,4,1,10/10/2011,I loved this place! So olden timey and fun! Sure you have to wait on line outside in the freezing cold but they bring you coffee and their sausage (amazing) which makes the wait well worth it. get a milkshake!
9621,28,5,1,10/10/2011,"Tom's is amazing. ˜You walk into the old-timey restaurant and the staff greet you with orange slices and water, like soccer moms. ˜Food is amazing. ˜I just had meatloaf and eggs, a new combination for me, and they were delicious. ˜Comes with home fries and toast, for $11 it is huge! ˜Pumpkin walnut waffles and pancakes are delicious. ˜Egg cream, amazing. ˜I have been here three times and I love it every time. ˜When people come visit, I always bring them to Tom's and the charm of the place makes everyone feel welcome"
9622,28,4,1,10/9/2011,"Alright. I had to eat here. I didn't want to, because every damn Saturday and Sunday morning there is a GIANT MOTHER-HUMPIN LINE to get into this place, and that line is made up of fixie-ridin, jort enthusiasts who only listen to bands I probably haven't heard of. Buuuuuut, the food here is perfect diner fair. They do everything right, and you can get the classics that seem to be harder and harder to find (egg creams, ugh). It's a bit touristy, being that it's right by the art museum, botanical gardens, zoo and park, but I live 2 blocks away - I couldn't avoid it much longer. However, if you find yourself here, and you don't to wait the 3 hours to get in, Teddy's up Washington is a fantastic alternative, with food that's just as good. Both places are worth seeing (tasting?), though! I know I keep complaining about the wait time, but I did also come here around 2pm on a weekday and it was quiet with no wait, soooo heads up to that. Bumtown, USA: closes by dinner. Can't go here after I've had too much a Franklin Park. But maybe that's for the best."
9623,28,4,1,10/3/2011,"I guess I should pronounce outright that you can't expect too much from Tom's. ˜I mean we are a breed of 21st century, time wasting snobs that share in common an uncanny level of excitement for eating and truly thinking about what we're eating, but you have to draw the line somewhere... somewhere... somewhere out there over the 20-something air waves Tom's got the knock for being a hipster diner. ˜Well at least that's how it was revealed to me. Screw that...it's just old and popular. ˜You get breakfast and lunch food that shouldn't inspire even the most contemptuous NY food snob to think too deeply. Tom's is a lot of fun...like Ryan Gosling's recent movie Drive (a Hipster Fairy Tale!), Tom's is like stepping back in time in a cramped space without ADA consideration (Something I've always liked to a great extent...slightly damp, concrete spaces with layers upon layers of decorative choices made more and more convoluted with each decade of business survival). We finally went after several subconscious, non-verbalized occasions where Tom's lost out to lesser, more obnoxious options, and I'd say all in all that the 30 minutes we sat at the bar and ate... -Danish Pancakes -Veggie Omelette -English Breakfast Tea -Tomato Juice ...were a good 30 minutes of my life. ˜The Veggie Omelette was cooked to the point the eggs resembled the dry skin that accumulates when you rub your hand over it, but it was packed with veggies and quite tasty, but... it's their pancakes that really seal (well ya never gonna survive...unless) the deal. ˜The Danish Pancakes are: ricotta, lemon zest, parmesan and blueberries. ˜They, in contrast to the eggs, were cooked to perfection...fluffy and light. ˜Not like the vast majority of the malicious world of pancakes that causes shit sweats 4 bites in. Tom's has character, zero space and food that isn't very special, but I guess it's appeal is that it still exists in the same way it probably always has without making big claims or bold statements, the only difference being that Mexicans run it...and that's a welcome change for me instead of a capitalizing old scab, or an old scab who could give a shit. Tom's doesn't need to be make you think, it just needs to be there like a ""coat stand that sits in the hall""..."
9624,28,5,1,10/1/2011,"A friend from out of town and I were looking for somewhere to have breakfast this morning, so we turned to our trusty friend Yelp to find this place. As we drove past, looking for the address, we both were hoping that ""the place with the long ass line"" was not it. Low and behold, our hopes and dreams were shattered as we walked up and realized that indeed the long ass line wrapped around the corner, with a woman passing snacks out to people in the line (an indication that the wait would be long) was Tom's. After asking a group of friends standing in line if the line was for take-out or to dine-in, we were relieved to find out that it was only for dining in. So, we walked in, past the folks waiting in line (that seemed to be moving pretty fast), ordered our food and waited all of 7 minutes for it to be ready. I ordered the banana walnut pancakes, home fries and some wheat toast. The pancakes are DIVINE. I haven't had pancakes in over a year and I'm glad they were the first to bless my taste buds after so long. It comes with three pretty large pancakes that I could finish in one sitting. They had just the right amount of banana and walnut and were thick yet fluffy. Just right. Wasn't a fan of the syrup they gave us so used some maple agave syrup blend from home (Trader Joe's). Soooo good!!! The home fries were disappointing, as they didn't have any flavor. Probably will pass on those next time. ˜ My friend ordered the special which included (I believe) 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 pieces of bacon, toast and home fries. Judging by the frequent grunts and eye-rolling after every bite and his ""we HAVE to go back there next time I'm here"" remark, I think it's safe to assume that he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. I HIGHLY recommend this place and will for sure be coming back!"
9625,28,5,1,9/30/2011,MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST IN ALL OF BROOKLYN. You cannot beat the ten differents kinds of HUGE pancakes for $7.
9626,28,4,1,9/27/2011,"Well, I don't feel like I really need to say I had to wait, because I'm sure that's obvious by previous reviews. So the question becomes was it worth the wait? Yes, it was. First, I appreciate the fact they have someone handing out cookies, orange slices & French fries (still debating my opinion on the accompanying sauce) while you wait in line. Very nice, but I would recommend passing because actually it only makes you hungrier- good gimmick to assure you order more I'm sure. Once you get in, the place is quaint & eclectic with a ton of Tom's press on the walls- they've noticeably had a ton of articles written about them. I sat down at a small, 2-seat table by the mirror near the front. After reading the reviews I was really wanting the pancakes with the cinnamon butter, so I order the pancakes, 2 eggs over easy & turkey bacon. In my mind I imagined much less than what was served to me. The pancakes were big & delicious...the cinnamon butter was a nice touch and great added flavoring. The eggs were good & not too runny & the bacon was the typical turkey bacon (although I like it I won't argue that it's not the same as real bacon & you do give up some tasty goodness in eating it instead). After I started eating & got pass the fact that it was really good, I just kept thinking about if I was going to take it home because there was no way i'd be able to find it & physically walk out of there on my own. The service was typical diner style- not bad but not a fully attentive wait staff."
9627,28,3,1,9/24/2011,"Lemon ricotta pancakes. YES! huge! Pancakes are more burnt than at other places that prefer fluffy pancakes. They have home fries, but not the style that I'm used. The pumpkin pancakes were unworthy of a second visit because we could not really taste the pumpkin. If it was near me, I would come back because of the fair prices."
9628,28,5,1,9/21/2011,"I love Tom's, but I hate crowds so I would never go on weekends. The restaurant is decorated in an interesting old fashion way and the service is great. The staff is friendly and the food is prepared fast. It is also very delicious. ˜I've tried the lemon ricotta pancakes, the sweet potato pancakes, and the pumpkin walnut pancakes and I was not disappointed. They were fantastic! I don't think I can eat at IHOP after having Tom's pancakes. Also the cherry lime rickey is delicious. Highly recommended!"
9629,28,4,1,9/19/2011,"The staff is nice, the food is cheap, and the decor is rad. The food is consistently good, although not mind-blowing, but I'll keep coming back because this place always transports me out of NY for a (much needed) moment. Two eggs/homefries/toast = 5 bucks"
9630,28,4,1,9/18/2011,"Get the 2-2-2: 2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 bacon. ˜BANGING! ˜Delicious! ˜But with Tom's, either you get it or you don't. ˜If you don't, that's your fault and nobody else's"
9631,28,5,1,9/3/2011,Tom has never fed me anything not good here. -1 star for the wait time but +1 star for their samples during the wait.
9632,28,5,1,9/1/2011,Best pancakes. Eggs are average. Specialty drinks are exceptional. No longer live in the neighborhood but will make the train ride back without food(!!!) just to get breakfast.
9633,28,4,1,8/31/2011,"My friend took me here when I was visiting NYC. It was a clustered looking place -- small, lots of people, not enough elbow room. Lots of things hung on the walls and the lights were dim. I sat down, looked around, and grew rather attached to the space. It felt welcoming. The food was tasty. I got lemon ricotta pancakes -- wonderfully fluffy and HUGE. It was enough for breakfast and lunch! My friend got something with sausages. I took a bite of greasy fatty salty goodness. It helped my already full stomach welcome more food. :D All in all, I would whole heartedly recommend this place!"
9634,28,4,1,8/27/2011,"The biggest challenge in going to Tom's is not to stuff yourself. The food is good in that, ""Let's go out and really treat ourselves to something tasty"" kinda way. And when you get there during weekend brunch hours, it becomes apparent that a lot of others had the same idea. They've had so many lines that they've put chairs outdoors for people to sit in while they wait. And they have given out cocoa and cookies to anxious potential diners. Yeah. You come here and you feel ""taken care of"". It's the Kings County version of southern hospitality. Goooooooood food and the atmosphere is an awesome cacophony of pictures and knick knackery. The place manages to be full of sunshine even with the few windows to be had. In a phrase, this is not just the love of food, but also the love of serving food."
9635,28,4,1,8/24/2011,"Breakfast dishes themselves are ok. I think food could be better somewhere else. But they serve you cookies, coffee, and other small breakfast items that makes waiting less boring. The decor inside is pretty wild also. It could be fun, but I wouldn't go out of my way to try it out again."
9636,28,5,1,8/21/2011,The 5 stars are for the only reason that they have home cooking casual food with large portions and great flavors. The place is a but small but you can take out food. Their humus has an awesome twist to it and do try their cornbread it is out of this world.
9637,28,3,1,8/15/2011,Good food but personally you can find it at a diner too and not have to wait 30min. The mexican omlett is good and the pancakes. Its nice to go a few times but I got bored with it after that
9638,28,5,1,8/9/2011,"Went here from the Yelp reviews. ˜Amazing little coffee shop. ˜I don't know how they do so much business working out of such a small kitchen. ˜At any rate, total NY experience. ˜Everything we ordered was excellent. ˜Next time we visit, we are definitely going to hit this place again."
9639,28,3,1,8/8/2011,"Got the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were dark brown on the outside. ˜The flavor was okay, but I'm not sure it's worth the trek out there."
9640,28,3,1,8/6/2011,"I have been to Tom's probably 8 times in a 3 year span. Most of my experiences here were good; the pancakes were good, homefries were bomb and good customer service. The last time I went was the worst display of customer service ever! It took 15 minutes to get our water. Then another 15 minutes to order. When our food finally came they got my friend's order wrong. This was particularly embarrassing since we were singing their praises! She asked two waiters THREE different times to please fix her order, she never lost her patience. About 30-45 minutes later they finally brought her the correct order. Before that I would have gave Tom's a 5 but this experience lowered my score."
9641,28,5,1,8/3/2011,"Whaaaaaat?!?!? This place only has an average of 4 stars! How can that be? You people are nuts! So the line on the weekend is outta control. What can you do? But it's worth every second. Hell, its worth even more. I would walk a thousand miles for Tom's. Do you hear that Tom? I loooove you!!! The crab cakes are to die for! So is every funky variety of pancakes I've tasted. Coffee is so good! You know what? Just ignore this review, I wouldn't want you all making the line even longer...."
9642,28,3,1,8/3/2011,"It was ok. I should have gotten the lemon ricotta pancakes like people suggested. I got the pumpkin walnut Belgian waffle and, while it tasted good, was rather dry. I was a bit disappointed with my ice coffee. They served it in a fountain glass (like you get shakes in) and there was a tiny bit of ice (I assume it melted) and they filled it to the brim so I had no room to add my cream. ˜It ended up spilling all over before I could sip some out. Oh well."
9643,28,4,1,8/2/2011,"The pumpkin walnut belgian waffle was panty dropping good, be sure to smear it w/ the cinnamon butter and syrup...ugh...so good! It was my first time here, but everytime I pass by here on the weekends, there's a line wrapped around the block, so it's gotta be good right? RIGHT! I was not disappointed by the food here! I also had the chicken parm. which was also good. Not great, i've had better, but not terrible. But it seems this place is known for their breakfast fare and they did not disappoint. I will definitely be back and devour more belgian waffles, pancakes, french toast... does anyone know a good cardiologist???"
9644,28,4,1,8/1/2011,"the crab cakes florentine knocked me off my seat. the cakes were crispy but not too heavy. the spinach was filled with yummy feta, and it was all served on a toasted buttery english muffin. the harvest pancakes were something a little different. corn and cranberries gave the dish a kind of savory and sweet combo that was perfect. not to mention tom's has somehow created the perfect pancake batter. you could put dandelions in their pancakes and it would be lovely. the biggest drawback, was of course, the wait to sit down. we arrived at 11am on a saturday and were seated within about 20 minutes. in that time we were given chocolate chip cookies, orange slices, water, and french fries. not bad. please, jesus, let other restaurants start serving their queuing customers snacks!"
9645,28,5,1,7/27/2011,FYI the Cherry Lime Rickeys get one free refill per glass.....and they taste great.
9646,28,4,1,7/26/2011,"Stumbled in for a meal while waiting on my car repair. Great old school diner atmosphere. Got my usual cheese omelet and homefries - hard to mess up, but few impress. Food was great. Will definitely be back."
9647,28,4,1,7/23/2011,Orgasmic breakfast. Crab cakes and cinnamon and banana pancakes...yum.
9648,28,5,1,7/19/2011,"Wow. ˜Tom's is a GREAT restaurant with top quality food, fair prices, excellent service. ˜Nothing ""foodie"" about it -- no coulis or reduction to be seen, thank the lord. ˜Just yummy, yummy food. ˜Try the mango-blueberry-walnut pancakes."
9649,28,4,1,7/17/2011,"Well, everyone was right. The lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious. As was the cherry lime ricky. Everything was decently priced and the service was friendly. Gotta love classic New York diners!"
9650,28,2,1,7/5/2011,"Was very underwhelmed with this place as popular as it seemed to be with the line out the door and all. The food was nothing worth putting any time into writing about, so in short unless you are severely lacking in options I wouldn't be bothered."
9651,28,4,1,7/5/2011,"Ended up dropping by here with a group of 4 on a Sunday morning around 1pm or so. It was a long party night and we were all pretty slow to get up, but we knew that we wanted some good, no frills breakfast food. Got to Tom's and saw some people waiting outside, uh oh...Turns out they were just waiting on some take-out and once we got in it was a quick 5 minute wait until we were seated. Service was very friendly and attentive, keeping our water and coffee full at all times. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes with a side of turkey sausage. The pancakes were fluffy and melted in my mouth. Turkey sausage was alright, I preferred my gf's pork sausage. Everyone else was very happy with their food (one ordered french toast, another cinnamon pancakes and my girlfriend had an omelet.) Great food, wonderful service and we even had a nice conversation with Jim (?) one of the managers. Definitely a go-to if in the area."
9652,28,4,1,7/3/2011,"Since this is quite a popular spot for brunch on the weekend, you'll have to wait in a long self-monitored line. ˜Someone will come out every time there is a free table to ask for the next party of two, three, four, etc... Although the line is annoying, the staff makes it better by bringing you samples of food and glasses of water. This alone is a nice gesture. As for the food, it's worth the wait. Those that enjoy the savory might enjoy the Eggs Florentine or even a side of corn beef hash or sausages. ˜Anyone that likes a sweet breakfast may feast on their pumpkin walnut waffles (slightly crispy on the outside and soft and cake-like on the inside) or the lemon ricotta pancakes (they're awesome and that's all you need to know). One time I found a piece of mesh wire (from a mesh wire sponge) on my plate. ˜They were so nice and offered me food to take home and a free breakfast. ˜It wasn't a big deal, but they were so nice about it that I can't complain. ˜ Bottom line: The food is tasty, the prices are cheap, the portions are decent. ˜Yes, it's crowded- but most good places in NYC are always crowded."
9653,28,2,1,6/30/2011,"Alright, so I know that everyone just loves Tom's. The decor is consistent with an old school NYC diner, but that's about the only truly memorable part of the restaurant. The service is shoddy, the food is mediocre and the lines on the weekend are just plain ridiculous Specifics, pros: 1. Decor - it's fun! 2. Pancakes - the pancakes are pretty friggin' good. If you are a pancake kind of person than you might as well try them out. Cons: 1. Lines on Saturdays (they're closed on Sunday, wtf?). ˜This line is one of the longest I've seen even for hip clubs and bars in Manhattan. I don't get it. 2. Eggs. What is breakfast without eggs? Tom's is a breakfast spot that frequently botches the eggs. I've had them undercooked, overcooked and everything in between. I go for the over-easy eggs which are usually overcooked. My girlfriend goes for the scrambleds which are rubbery and flavorless. 3. Service. It's kind of endearing the first time, but after a while being served by a staff of completely inexperienced servers gets a little annoying. Once you are sat down it is not uncommon to be asked more than twice if you've been helped, the food rarely comes out at the same time, and the check will probably arrive before you are done eating. In the end I would say that Tom's is worth a visit at least once. However, don't expect the novelty to remain on the third visit. Oh yea, those crab cakes are pretty gross actually. Clearly frozen and thrown in the frier."
9654,28,5,1,6/26/2011,Holy crap. Amazing food and very reasonably priced. I got the crabcake florentine with a side of beef sausage. It was incredible. I will absolutely be going back!
9655,28,4,1,6/23/2011,"The other reviews are true, this place is as good as they say. Come a bit early, 8-9 and beat a long wait. When we walked out at 11-ish the line was out the door. Service is friendly, but fast, typrical diner. Lemon Ricotta pancakes and flavored butter was awesome!"
9656,28,5,1,6/22/2011,"Get the Crab Cakes Florentine. ˜Oh my GOD the sauce that comes with them. ˜The creeping kind of delicious spicy that doesn't start out too hot, but by the time you're done eating it's intense! Nowhere else in this neighborhood are you going to find an authentic Egg Cream or Cherry Lime Rickey. ˜While we're on beverages, ˜the shakes are thick and wonderful. ˜They don't skimp. The Sweet Potato pancakes are fantastic. ˜Fluffy, hearty and wonderful. ˜They come with a sampler of different home made butters - Apricot, Cinnamon and Strawberry. ˜Even if you don't like one of the flavors... there's three! On weekends, there's a line 30 people long at least, but get this. ˜They treat you well on line! ˜Every 10-15 minutes, one of the staff comes by with complimentary orange slices or fresh baked cookies. ˜They want you to *enjoy* standing on line. ˜This is unique to New York. ˜Even if they're busy, they're good to you! Go. ˜They deserve your business. ˜Cash only, but they have a reasonably priced ATM on the premises."
9657,28,5,1,6/21/2011,This is probably my favorite breakfast place. When there's a line they hook you up with plenty of snacks during the wait. Make you feel like a king. Then once you get your table - the service is solid and the food is amazing.
9658,28,5,1,6/18/2011,"My friends and I were at the Botanical Gardens and got hungry, so we searched Yelp and found Tom's. I would come here a million times. I got the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were DIVINE! The variety of pancakes they offer at Tom's is awesome (sweet potato, danish, mango blueberry, pumpkin, etc.) They also have good butters that come with the pancakes (strawberry, cinnamon, banana/mango). The prices are right, too. Everyone I was with left Tom's happy. I would definitely go back."
9659,28,4,1,6/18/2011,"This is a great diner type establishment, nothing gourmet or truly unexpected, plain food well done. I'm a fan of breakfast here, the banana walnut pancakes are WIN, service is great and the decor is both over the top and yet cozy. All in all a great place to nurse a hangover, or take the hookup who's name you're still trying to remember.... lol"
9660,28,4,1,6/14/2011,"On our way to the UES to see an exhibit, we stopped for weekday brunch at Tom's. I'd seen it from the outside in Winter but never been eaten in, so I was pretty excited. I received a HUGE plate of banana walnut pancakes and 3 kinds of butter. They were really awesome pancakes, fluffy but not too heavy. I could still only eat 1 and a bit. I also had a few bites of the potato hash - om nom!! The food was great, service was good, I felt comfortable and the experience was really satisfying. I only wish there were a few more non-egg vegetarian options on the menu."
9661,28,4,1,5/30/2011,"When I was offered sausage, fries, orange slices, cookie bites, and ice water while waiting in line, I knew I already liked the place. ˜This diner has that random out of date holiday decor going on for itself. ˜Cherry Lime Rickeys seem to be a tradition here, it was tasty but just a cherry seltzer drink. ˜I had the meatloaf and eggs over easy. ˜DELICIOUS. ˜My friend had the crabcake florentine. ˜DELICIOUS. ˜The french fries we had while waiting were awesome and had a kick, but I mistakenly ordered the homefries thinking I was going to get those same fries. ˜Our table shared the lemon ricotta pancakes and the sweet potato pancakes. ˜They were fluffy, but the flavors were more subtle than I was expecting - couldn't identify any presence of ricotta, but they were tasty still. ˜They had ˜(what I think is homemade) cinnamon butter, strawberry butter, and peach butter in addition to the normal butter packets. ˜If you're in New York and need a reason to go to Brooklyn, you've just found one."
9662,28,4,1,5/16/2011,"Four stars is pretty accurate. There are parts of their menu that are five stars, I'm thinking what may possibly be the best french fries in the city, as well as the sort of spicy mayo sauce that goes with them. But then there are parts that may be good, aren't truly top notch. ˜I liked my pancakes but they were really thick and cake-y, instead of being a bit lighter and fluffy. Cool place though, and I'll definitely be back to explore the menu more fully."
9663,28,5,1,5/13/2011,"The food at Tom's is basic diner food, maybe nothing to write home about. But when you're looking for diner food, that's what you want. A classic meal where you know what you're getting. What sets Tom's apart is the service. Gus, the former owner, should write a book on how to make customers feel important and satisfied with their experience, plenty of places could learn a lot from him. Come before noon on a weekend to miss the worst of the lines, and have a complicmentary cookie and coffee while you wait."
9664,28,3,1,5/4/2011,Breakfast here on 04 May. ˜Lemon Ricotta pancakes were very good but the service was a bit disorganized. ˜We had an extra guest and had to move tables and staff handled this well. ˜The owner was a really nice fellow. ˜Talked about the Gowanus Canal.
9665,28,5,1,5/3/2011,"this one lives up. best breakfast in new york, hands down."
9666,28,4,1,4/26/2011,"If you live in the neighborhood and haven't been here for brunch, you are doing something wrong. Tom's is like this place in Columbus that I love to this day called the Blue Danube, or the Dube, to locals. It is a diner. It has diner-y food. You'll probably eat something relatively unhealthy, or at least try to - I had a veggie omelet and french fries. Way to break even! But it has so many delicious options, and the staff are wonderful. It looks crazy inside, as there are a million autographed photos (i see you marlo stanfield) and signs and features from the paper about the place gracing the walls. Honestly, I wouldn't care if the walls were covered with kids drawings or old timey photos or police blotters. It just doesn't matter. There can be a line, but if so, they bring around coffee, and sausage, and french fries with their extremely strong horseradish sauce, so by the time you're seated, you've probably eaten half of a meal anyway. Service is fast and they'll give you a million diet cokes if you need them. Which I do."
9667,28,4,1,4/23/2011,"A classic! Service is excellent, food is great -- makes the long lines worth the wait (it's very cool that the staff will pass out coffee, cookies, even pieces of sausage to folks in line). Lemon ricotta pancakes are divine, and you can't go wrong with any of the egg dishes. Price is always right. Only bummer - delivery is so-so. I wish that they were open later. One time, I ordered lunch and my burger arrived soggy."
9668,28,4,1,4/22/2011,"Classy!.... for a diner that is. Heck the food is way better than some other places that pass for high-end and the portions are generous. I found the best pancakes in the city here, and I'm a serious pancake critic. The staff are on it and the atmosphere is welcoming. ˜Yum!"
9669,28,4,1,4/11/2011,"Okay... Here's my deal with Tom's. PRO - The environment outside and inside is so welcoming. Just by looking at the inside and outside, you know your meal is gonna be good. CON - Long Line PRO - The line moves relatively quickly cause they turn tables faster than any restaurant I've seen AND you get little snacks while you wait (Cookies, little ham steaks) CON - Floor's are pretty dirty - I know they're extremely busy from the moment those doors open till the moment they close, btu someone could go through that dining area with a swiffer at some point. PRO - The Staff is so nice. Our waiter, the manager the people just handing out the cookies in line. Always with a smile. I watched some girl get called over by a table to get them water... in most NYC restaurants you'd visibly see that employee roll their eyes with a ""That's not my job"" attitude, but this girl was super friendly about it. CON - only two flavors of milk shake (chocolate and vanilla) PRO - So many options for breakfast lunch and dinner. Great menu. OVERALL: Food - 4 out of 5 Drink - 4 out of 5 Environment - 4 out of 5 Staff - 5 out of 5 Price - 3 out of 5 (I always want everything to be cheaper though. That's the JEW in me) Overall Score: 4 out of 5"
9670,28,4,1,4/10/2011,"We were looking for pancakes in all the wrong places until we found Tom's!! Be prepared to wait in line but they are awesome at their speedy turnover; being efficient in the kitchen and service. We ordered banana walnut pancakes and the Mexican omelet, omelet wasn't that great best to stick with the pancakes here. ˜Their flavored butters were awesome, strawberry wasn't that rockin' but hey can't get everything right, right?! This is also true for their coffee..... Funky quaint atmosphere, a must do if staying in and around Brooklyn for breakfast!"
9671,28,5,1,4/9/2011,"I'm never disappointed--it's a fast-paced Prospect Heights neighborhood staple with great, attentive service. ˜I always enjoy my breakfast--whatever the time of the day. ˜And depending on what time you arrive, you may be in for a surprise--yup, a long line. ˜But, it moves quickly and they definitely make it up with staff smiles, on-the-house orange slices and cookies (take your pick or both if you like), and quick service. ˜I'm an omelet and coffee girl--the cherry-lime Ricky is great too. And once you're done eating, why not walk it off by making a trip to the Botanic Gardens and/or the Brooklyn Museum. ˜I missed First Saturdays at the Brooklyn Museum last weekend though (frowning)."
9672,28,2,1,4/4/2011,"yes, its notorious for the best brunch in Brooklyn, and yes, I buy into it and wait in line on a Sunday morning when I have someone from out of town visiting, and yes, they always enjoy it, BUT honestly I'm not a big fan. Its great they give you stuff while waiting in line (cookies, oranges, sausage), and its got the cute old diner atmosphere but my main issue is with the eggs. As a vegetarian, I try and ignore the fact that all of the eggs are cooked on a griddle covered with meat fat (its pretty standard, but waiting in line looking at it grosses me out a bit) ˜I just wish the end product was worth it. I get that they make things insanely fast, but I still think the omelets are half-assed. Don't expect fluffy eggs with your fillings inside- its all mixed together, sometimes with cheese in the center. The flavored butters and fancy pancakes are nice, but I'm never really impressed. Meat-eaters and first-timers always enjoy it but I'd rather take my sweet time eating, drink mimosas and have a salad with my fancy omelet-options a few blocks away at The Spot."
9673,28,1,1,4/3/2011,Huge disappointment. Pancake was like lead. Coffee bland. Line ridiculously long. (they're not handing out gold people). I could name three other diners that are better off the top of my head.
9674,28,5,1,4/2/2011,"Tom's never disappoints....EVER. ˜ I've gone more than a few times and I always leave satisfied. ˜ Pancake selection is off the hook: sweet potato, banana walnut, mango walnut, lemon ricotta, just to name a few. The pancakes also come with strawberry, cinnamon sugar and orange zest and walnut butter to go with the pancakes....craziness! Omelettes, cherry lime rickeys, belgian waffles, smoked turkey sausage, grits, big ass cups of tea, hot chocolate that looks like cappucino, funky decor,fast and efficient service, lines out the door, little bites to eat while you wait on line....that's Tom's for you."
9675,28,4,1,3/25/2011,"Fat girl grove all the way. Egg cream!! Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!! Free snacks while waiting in line!!! I shall be back...maybe I'll shoot for a weekday when there's no wait. (((one negative if you have a nut allergy, they seem to have alot of dishes that have some of nut in it))"
9676,28,5,1,3/22/2011,Classic Brooklyn. This is one of my very favorite brunch spots. Awesome pancakes and special butters. The prices are good and so are the decorations.
9677,28,4,1,3/22/2011,"I'm not 100% sure my fellow Yelpers are correct when they say Suzanne Vega wrote ""Tom's Diner"" after this place. I'm pretty sure, that song was written for the Tom's (Monks from Seinfeld) on the Upper West Side. Anyhow, enough about the music lesson, this defines what a diner should be....food, decor and of course the service. Everything from top to bottom of Tom's is very cool, comfortable and most importantly for me, clean. I'm not a Brooklynite so I don't know about the ""cult"" following for its brunch. I'm just a Bronxite passing by the area on a weekday looking for a good lunch option. I made the right decision. ""I am sitting In the morning At the diner On the corner"""
9678,28,5,1,3/21/2011,Amazing brunch
9679,28,3,1,3/16/2011,"Yelp world, here's a tip - come here on a Fri morning for brunch, no lines! All breakfast/brunch items were traditional with a slight twist. My friend got the chocolate chip pancake and drizzled it with syrup and cinnamon butter. I got the belgian waffle with blueberries We also ordered fries & 2 over easy eggs Everything was amazing down to the little lady at the cash register... But, I'm not sure if I'll be back.. I want my brunch items all sorts of twisted and fun."
9680,28,3,1,3/13/2011,"Been here a few times. Will be back. Long lines made palatable w/ servings of free bacon, juice, coffee, cantelope wedges, etc. Tom (source of corny nun jokes) is recently retired. His nephew runs the place and Its now open on Sunday's (not the case when Tom was in charge). Food is diner quality - not too good, not too bad, Atmosphere is friendly and fun (cluttered w/ misc collectibles). Prices are standard for a diner"
9681,28,2,1,3/13/2011,"I agree with Christy below- Tom's is JUST a basic DINER-with a line out the door, in a area that has FEW options so its famous! Believe me, if I opened a place across the street- I would beat them hands down, anyone could who has basic taste. The reality is, there are FEW places in Brooklyn that are similar, and NOTHING around this area. The food is BASIC Diner type-NOTHING SPECIAL. Ok, so they have SOME fresh ingredients -so does Cracker Barrel and half the city. The fact is, unless its a weekday-you have a line of people and staff pushing you OUT the door while still chewing, the plate is slammed at you to shove down, and the food is NO different than half the delis and corner diners all over the city-all this after waiting a hour like a idiot to get in. Yes its cute and cosy inside, and if it were a slow day, maybe friendlier staff, but the food is nothing to write home about, just average at best-TYPICAL average diner. I would ONLY return out of desperation on a weekday, I can make a better breakfast at home or order delivery for the SAME omelet, with buttered cheap generic toast at Purity Diner down the street a couple blocks. Cheers and have fun following the herd to Toms!"
9682,28,5,1,3/11/2011,"Other notable pancake joints have gotten praise, press and have their fun marketing ploys with monthly flavors (you know who they (and you) are)... sorry but Tom's STILL reigns supreme. Consistently good, they have their style of doing things and it works. Pancakes.. omg the freakin pancakes!"
9683,28,1,1,3/6/2011,"i don't understand the fuss. I had the veggie omelet, home fries,and ˜pork sausage. bland, bland, bland. the omelet tasted like burnt griddle ˜and the spinach in the omelet was freezer-burned. the sausage had no flavor besides that of fat and it wasn't even tasty fat. (also $4 for 2 links sliced in half is no bargain) the meal was so unsatisfying that i went home and toasted waffles. Would never wait on line to ear here and might not eat here even if there were no line."
9684,28,4,1,3/5/2011,"Fun place! Good prices and good food! I don't wait in lines though, so we went at 8:30 on a Saturday and were promptly seated and served. Great coffee! I wasn't impressed by the flavored butters, but everything served was solid. Service was efficient and prompt, not harried. Will def go there again!"
9685,28,5,1,2/28/2011,"when it comes to weekend breakfast, htis is your place.... everything about this place is perfect from the service to the food, to the decor and coziness the menu is full of choices and is really really inexpensive... there was a line down the block, that I thought was way too cold to wait in... however after my meal and when i saw they were offering coffee and light fare to those in line ...... I would agree to the wait! I had pancakes and a side of beef sausage with lemon juice squeezed on top......so delicious.... the staff was very attentive milkshakes and malts looked delicous too! it is easy to see why this place is a hit and an easy favorite!!!"
9686,28,4,1,2/27/2011,"For hooking me up with a view of flowers while I wait, I guess that's cool. For hooking me up with free food while I wait, that's definitely cool. Strawberries? Don't mind if I do, sir.. Coffee? Yes, please. This is about the only place I'll order an egg cream or a cherry lime rickey from, but I couldn't tell you why. It just feels right somehow. This place just feels right. It's like it got warped here after an episode of ""Leave it to Beaver"" or something. Sure, as other reviews have pointed out, at the end of the day it is JUST diner food. However, it's diner food done better than almost anyone else. As far as the service is concerned, while you won't get free food for waiting in the south (most times), you will get the same kind of attentive service, though it will probably be from a meth-addled old white lady at Waffle House at 3am as opposed to these guys, who will cut up with you and laugh at your ridiculous jokes. However, this is NYC, and I have yet to see anywhere else here that gives this level of service without having the decimal point shifted one place to the right by the end of the meal."
9687,28,5,1,2/23/2011,"My friend and I were looking for a brunch place near Brooklyn Museum with good prices. We found Tom's and probably enjoyed the trip there more than our trip to the museum. Yes, there was a line and an unusual bit of a wait at eleven a.m. We figured that there must be delicious foods inside. This was very true! I ordered the two eggs and two pancakes and so did my friend. The pancakes were to die for! Tom's even offered flavored butters, however the pancakes are so good you don't even need them. The eggs were cooked just right and the bacon was good too. I can't wait to go back!"
9688,28,4,1,2/21/2011,"I love Tom's. ˜My monument to Tom's is my ever-increasing waistline. ˜The Harvest pancakes, the fries, and their beef sausage are the loves of my life. ˜The friendly efficient service is tops. ˜If you can wade through the hipster beards and homely girls in plastic eye wear, you'll do okay. One star off because their delivery is not as efficient -- their usually super crisp fries were extremely soggy when they arrived. I still love you, Tom."
9689,28,5,1,2/21/2011,"after reading some reviews, we decided to try this place on sunday around brunch time. we were worried the line would be around the block based on the reviews but to our surprise the line wasnt long at all and as soon as we got there cookies were served, a few minutes later a really good ham, and then a few minutes after that, sausage. we only waited about 15-20 minutes which isnt bad at all in my book. they even had chairs lined up so you can sit and wait. service was extremely fast. the waiter came within a few minutes to get our drink and food order and within 10 min our food came. both the waiter and manager came by to make sure our food was to our liking and that the guys' steaks were cooked the way the wanted i had the sweet potato pancakes with bananas and scrambled eggs. - fluffy, flavorful and the flavored butters it came with were really good. the fruit was fresh and the eggs were cooked perfectly and the portions were huge. the guys had the special which was steak and eggs with a side of potatoes. it was cooked to how they wanted and the steak was a good size..and they loved it, cleaned their plates! they also gave peter lugers steak sauce which was a plus! overall-great food, great and friendly service and even if the line is long, its tolerable because of the service outside the restaurant. when we left we saw they were passing out hot coffee. they obviously care about their customers and we would definitely come back again"
9690,28,5,1,2/17/2011,"This place is the shiz, you get orange slices and cookies BEFORE your meal! It's a historic kind of place, don't expect fine dinning, just good honest grub"
9691,28,5,1,2/13/2011,"This place is the best! There is often a line to get a table, but the staff does everything to make your wait more tolerable. They bring out orange slices, cookies, and cinnamon toast while you wait and get you seated as quickly as possible. They have the fluffiest pancakes with fresh fruit and perfect omelets. The prices can't be beat and the service is always with a smile. ˜ One thing to note is that they are cash only."
9692,28,2,1,2/6/2011,"The extra star goes directly to the woman who passed out potatoes, coffee, orange slices, and cookies to folks waiting to get in. I admit, that was impressive, and a really brilliant idea for any wrap-around line for a restaurant. I know, the place is wacky and weird looking. The decor is creative, cluttered, and makes you feel like you're having an experience ""somewhere"", which you are. Naturally. But how much of that experience is lost in the stuff around you? For me, almost all of it. I like to eat when I go to a restaurant. Especially in the morning. And especially after waiting in line for close to an hour. My poor outlook of this place has everything to do with my taste in food. After a meal, I prefer to feel a little more alive than I did before eating, not a lot more dehydrated and disgusting and greasy. Some meals leave a feeling of not having showered for a week. Tom's was more around a month. Sorry, Susan. I'm sure the coffee was much better back then."
9693,28,4,1,2/4/2011,"Stopped by Toms in anticipation of the raved over pancakes. ˜Toms is definitely a blast from the past with a healthy dose of plastic flowers adorning the wood paneled walls accented by antiqued yellowed lighting. Aaaaah, we're not here to critique decor! Lets get to the crux of the matter here. Food!!!!!! As we sat and took in the sights waiting on our food, the waiter was kind enough to hook us up with two cherry lime rickeys on the house! Nice beverage, certainly. I ordered the 2x2x2 combo with 2 eggs, 2 pork sausages and two plain pancakes with flavored butters. My fiancee got the pumpkin walnut pancakes with cinnamon flavored butter. All in all, I loved the pancakes, fluffy, tasty and light. The different butters definitely added another dimension to them. I honestly could have passed on the eggs and sausages, neither were anything to write home to Mama about, lol. I'll definitely be back for several orders of the 'cakes. :-)"
9694,28,5,1,1/30/2011,"THE BEST DINER IN NYC PERIOD! Susan Vega knew, which is why she wrote the homage 80s hit Tom's Diner. I've been going to Tom's since I moved to the hood almost 10 yrs ago & I won't stop. Guss (the owner) greets everyone like old friends. Go once, he'll remember you forever! The variety of pancakes are out of this world and I've tried them all: ricotta, sweet potato, banana walnut, mango & berry, corn... then there's the flavored butters: cinnamon, peach... The cheese grits are yummy! The famous Cherry Lime Ricky! The damn french fries!!! Ok. I heart this place & as a person who won't wait to get into a club, I humbly stand on line for this. The only thing: I swear they sprinkle itis on their food because everyone I know is always ready for night night right after. It never fails. Thank goodness I live right around the corner. Just remember to have cash on hand. No cards."
9695,28,4,1,1/30/2011,"Tom's was alright... ˜to be honest, most of it's greatness is in it's image and atmosphere. The staff was absolutely excellent, so nice and courteous. But the food, I've had better. came out SO quick though. I had an omelet and my boyfriend had a sandwich, next time I would try the pancakes.. that seems to be it's specialty). Omelet was overcooked with no sign of cheese, toast was cold, and home fries (while seasoned nicely) were a little under-done. My boyfriends sandwich though was great. One nice perk: while you wait in line (there was at least 10-20 people in line at all times) they serve you oranges, cookies, french toast, soo nice). So I gave it four stars because overall it was a pleasant experience, but not five stars because I could make better food at home."
9696,28,5,1,1/22/2011,"unnngggh. I moan with pleasure at the thought of Tom's diner. Also a little pain. There has not been one single time that i've gone to Tom's without eating to the point of exhaustion, or nausea. Favorites: lemon ricotta pancakes, danish pancakes, french fries, eggs benedict, nice strong coffee The little assortment of flavored butter is amazing. Usually it's cinnamon, strawberry and lemon so you have a butter to complement any pancake you order. The only con is the customary wait but the line usually goes quickly plus someone comes out bearing gifts of free coffee, cookies, french fries and/or orange slices. Its probably the most charming thing about Tom's. Go there if you can, you wont regret it!"
9697,28,4,1,1/2/2011,"Great place to eat! They feed you free food while you wait on line! And they have ham/turkey bacon, yum! The service is outstanding."
9698,28,4,1,1/2/2011,"What a great place! We had the sweet potato pancakes and a reuben sandwich. The pancakes were amazing. They're served with three kinds of flavored butter. Definitely try them. The sandwich was good as well. We want to go back and try more items from the menu. The place was packed, but the service was great. It's also only a few blocks from the Brooklyn Museum."
9699,28,4,1,1/2/2011,"This place rocks. The line is always out the door, but they serve you coffee and scones while you wait in line- how nice! The only reason I can't give 5 stars is because there is ALWAYS at least a 20-30 min wait on weekends which is when I always go"
9700,28,5,1,12/30/2010,"If you are in the mood for small, quaint, inexpensive, big taste dining in the heart of Brooklyn I reccommend Tom's. I adore this place. Walked in to be greeted with some tasty treats while I waited on a long line to be seated. They have a lunch menu but serve breakfast all day. The place being packed with local families, couples, and single people reading a book and eating some breakfast made for a very welcoming atmosphere. I will def return to Tom's"
9701,28,2,1,12/28/2010,"Another overhyped eatery in NYC. This place is resting on some ill-deserved laurels. ˜Yes, while you wait in the nonsensically long line, you will be offered orange slices and cheap cookies. ˜But being given free mediocre food while waiting in line, only to make it inside and be given even more mediocre food that you then have to pay for is too much insult to bear. ˜ I came here after visiting the Brooklyn Botanic Garden with an old friend. ˜The only memorable thing about this place was the magnitude of the inverse proportion between (a) the quality of the food and (b) the popularity. ˜ ˜I remember having some lackluster grits, among other things, and my friend had some edible pancakes. ˜This was basically a meal at a Waffle House but with higher prices and more hipsters. ˜Edible, but at this point in its history, it's relying on style more than substance. The old-timey soda fountain-y drinks were intriguing, but I didn't try any. ˜Maybe worth a visit for the vintage flair. ˜ Overall, recommended only if you are insanely hungry, and cash-poor (and/or homeless), and in the neighborhood, and have few scruples--i.e., stand in line for the free snacks and then get on with your day."
9702,28,5,1,12/15/2010,"If you want comfort food that's tasty, and reason -- Tom's is the place to go! The service is AMAAAZING! They even give you slices of oranges as you are waited to be seated, in that looong line! 5 stars!"
9703,28,4,1,12/5/2010,"Blueberry,walnut,mango pancakes never stood a chance! Fantastical fruit festival in my mouth! A must for brunch!"
9704,28,4,1,12/1/2010,Classic New York diner with an excellent breakfast. ˜It was entirely packed with an early crowd. ˜Prices were very reasonable.
9705,28,4,1,11/29/2010,"This was my neighborhood diner for about 10 years and it made me not like other diners as much, as a result. The food was always fresh, fast and served with a smile. It's a little sad that Gus isn't around to great you and hassle you, but Tom's lived on. The Turkey Melt sandwich is amazing, burgers are solid and I always went for straight ahead eggs or corned beef hash for breakfast. It's worth the wait, especially since you get cookies, oranges and coffee in line. Once you get inside and get to listen to big band tunes and enjoy the decor, you'll settle down. Get an order of Silver Dollars to share with your table - you get to sample the unique butters and damn good pancakes."
9706,28,4,1,11/28/2010,"Tom's is great! The line looked extremely long, but it moved much quicker than I expected. What's even better is that while you are waiting in line they pass out samples of sausages, fruit, and water. After being seated I ordered the beef sausage which is excellent, especially with lemon squirted on it. I also had the pancakes which are AWESOME!! Best pancakes I've had in a long time. You've gotta try this diner, because you cant go wrong with this menu. They get all of the oldies but goodies right!"
9707,28,2,1,11/22/2010,"Not impressed at all. Read reviews and this was a nice walk, so went over. Omelettes were cooked til brown, ie overdone, fried potatoes were tasteless. Coffee was just ok. Setting is very nice albeit crowded. Turkey sausage was very delish - best I've had anywhere - so that was a bright spot. ;-) And service was absolutely excellent."
7616,28,4,1,11/22/2010,"I did it a couple times, survived the line for some excellent food. Yes on weekend the line is long, yes you are sometimes outside in the rain or sun. But its worth it. Yes Tom's is an original, zagat rated and famous. It is worth it. The pancakes are famous and so are waffles. Now the Huevo Ranchero are favorite. The Cherry Lime Ricky best I have ever had. So suck it up wait in line and enjoy!"
9708,28,5,1,11/22/2010,"Tom's Diner is the perfect diner. The line is long on the weekend, but to reward your patience the staff comes out with coffee, fruit, sausage, or anything to appease you appetite. I recommend everything. The scrambled eggs are just right. They have a variety of unique pancakes and butters. ˜I really like the Sweet Potato pancakes with the Cinnamon sugar butter. I always get a Black & White Shake, it is the only place in Brooklyn where you can get an old fashioned thick shake. The diner inside is bustling. The decor isn't bad, but it is definitely a no frills, traditional diner. Dare I say, I feel as if I walked into a Woody Allen movie circa 1970s NYC ... I don't even recommend just going, I recommend going frequently. Go hungover on Sunday (now open on Sundays!!), go early in the morning before work and try everything!!!!"
9709,28,5,1,11/22/2010,"Wanting some home-style breakfast fare, my friend Enrique and I walked the couple of blocks from his apartment to Tom's. ˜Already hungry enough to stop at the first hot dog stand or taco truck, I was a bit hesitant seeing a line of customers crowding the doorway. ˜""It's okay,"" Enrique promised, ""you'll get fed immediately, just wait."" ""Immediately?"" I thought to myself, lining up against the wrought iron railing separating the seated diners from the rest of us hopefuls. ˜Then the food came. ˜No really, food did come! ˜Carrying a large serving bowl, one of the employees came down the line handing out fresh slices of banana, apples, and oranges. ˜ While nibbling on the fruit I perused the menu, settling on two eggs over easy, home fries, sausage, and sourdough toast. ˜Not the most inventive ordering on my behalf, but a sure fire way to judge a restaurant's ability. ˜Tom passed the test with flying colors. ˜The yolks were perfectly runny, the potatoes crispy on the outside while remaining soft and fluffy on the inside, and the sausage a juicy mouthful of fatty deliciousness. ˜ Mopping up my plate with the sourdough, I asked the proprietor for a recommendation to take Enrique for egg creams. ˜""You've never had an egg cream?"" he asked Enrique, ""where are you from?"" ˜ ""Mexico City,"" Enrique responded proudly. ˜ ""Well, my Mexican friend,"" he said shaking Enrique's hand firmly, ""two egg creams on the house."""
9710,28,5,1,11/12/2010,"i.l.o.v.e.t.o.m.s!!! This place is the cutest thing in Prospect Heights and the staff are some of the nicest people around. I love going in the winter as when the line gets long, the waiters hand out orange quarters, coffee and pieces of sausage. How nice is that?! The menu is typical diner heaven but try and get a booth as these are the best. I love their eggs and homefries and the milkshakes are delicious too. Since I moved from the P.Heights, I really miss going here for brunch. This is one of the best things about the neighborhood."
9711,28,1,1,11/12/2010,"You are all being DUPED! ˜ I have no idea why people flock to this place, and the fact that people wait in line to get in is just plain stupid. ˜I resent having to give this place any stars, but Yelp made me give it at least 1. The food is not at all special and overpriced. ˜I am willing to admit that it is perhaps on par with any other cheap diner in Brooklyn, but the truth is that Tom's isn't really that cheap...It costs me something like 14 or 15 bucks to have lunch there. ˜Their home fries are season-less and not crispy. ˜ The coffee is amongst the worst I've ever had...it's watery and flavorless even by NYC deli standards. ˜It literally toes the line of whether or not you can call it coffee. ˜It is like drinking brown hot water. ˜It is pointless. ˜ People seem to rant and rave about the service...well, the reason I'm writing this review right now is because I just had the unfortunate experience of going to Tom's...trust me, I avoid it at all costs, but Cafe Shane is being renovated (more on that later)...anyways, I placed my breakfast order, and waited..and waited, only to find out 20 minutes later that my order had not been placed! ˜They started to ask me what my order was again, at which point I left. ˜Furthermore, passing out disgusting sugar cookies with metal tongs does not compensate for impersonal service. I know people like to cut Tom's some slack because of it's old school charm, or it decor, or atmosphere, but that is COMPLETE crap! ˜I am not charmed. ˜The decor is tacky, and I have a feeling that people in the 50's thought so as well. ˜The music is just terrible. ˜It is the soundtrack of purgatory. ˜ The craziest part of all of this is that I have walked past that long line at Tom's countless times to go to Cafe Shane's TWO DOORS DOWN, where the food is DELICIOUS, and there's usually never a wait, and the service is great and personable, and the atmosphere is awesome, usually with Soul music playing, or a DVD of James Brown or Sam Cooke being played, AND IT'S CHEAPER THEN TOM'S!!!!!! So if you enjoy waiting in line to pay too much money for sub par food, while sitting on plastic lawn furniture and listening to mind numbing music, then Tom's is your place....I'll be at Cafe Shane's."
9712,28,4,1,11/12/2010,"Mmm... Tom's, apparently, is an institution. At the very least, the long line around the block every Saturday and Sunday morning would indicate that this is indeed the case. And I must say that Tom's food deserves the long lines on bitterly cold November mornings. Simple and delicious, Tom's breakfast/brunch offerings are truly delightful. ˜For $7, one can get two pancakes, two scrambled eggs, and two pieces of bacon or sausage (I opt for the turkey bacon...which is a little more expensive) or an omelet with the GREATEST FRENCH FRIES IN THE WORLD (not an understatement) and toast that would cost at least $10 anywhere in Manhattan. The service is courteous, the interior is kitschy and warm, and the Cherry Lime Rickys are truly the bomb. Tom's...thank you for being so close to my apartment, and for keeping me pudgy through the winter."
9713,28,2,1,11/9/2010,"People rant and rave about Tom's. ˜In fact, they stand in a line wrapped around the corner! ˜It's nice that the staff hands out coffee to those waiting in the cold, but it seems like just another greasy spoon to me. ˜The food always leaves me feeling like I have a brick in my stomach. ˜The only reason I agree to meet friends here now is if I'm nursing a hangover. ˜Otherwise, there are many other brunch place is the neighborhood that don't render you couchbound for the rest of the day."
9714,28,5,1,11/8/2010,"First-- CASH ONLY!! This place is so good that I had to write my first Yelp review. And I've been to A LOT of different yummy places! My roomie Linet K. and I decided to try out this place after all of the awesome Yelp reviews. SOOOO glad we did. Where else can you get served hot coffee,cookies,apple pancakes, home fries and beef sausage by a sweet old man while waiting in line? Tried to not take to much off the yummy sampling platter as I knew I'd be too full to try all of the other things on the menu. We ended up sharing the Juevos Rancheros and Pumpkin walnut pancakes. All I need to say is that I feel sorry for the rest of the menu because I'll never get to sample anything else. I'm SOLD on the Pumpkin pancakes. Oh, and did I mention you can slather cinnamon butter on top of them? YUM!! Best I've ever had!!"
9715,28,5,1,11/7/2010,"This place was such an experience that it convinced me to join Yelp just so I can share its ""amazing-ness"" with others. Firstly, I completely agree that the line is part of the experience. While my roommate and I waited in the cold morning weather, we were served coffee along with samples of delicious sausages and pancakes. This aloud us not only to warm up, but it gave us a great idea of what we would like to order once we got inside. The people working there greeted us like family and the food was DEFINITELY worth the wait. We shared the pumpkin walnut pancakes (with the cinnamon butter... yummy) and juevos rancheros. I have to say that it was the best pumpkin pancakes I have ever had.... coming from a pumpkin lover this says alot. The juevos rancheros was equally as mouthwatering. We also ordered a side of the sausage, inspired by the taste test in the line earlier. The only downside was that our table was a little small and it is cash only, however everything else made up for those minor observations. (They do have an ATM machine inside) I have found my permanent breakfast place and HIGHLY recommend it to other as well."
9716,28,4,1,11/6/2010,"Boo Hoo, Cash Only. ˜ This place is so cute. ˜Reminiscent of an old school diner. ˜They serve you food while you're waiting to be seated. The food is what you would expect from a diner, eggs, potatoes, toast. ˜What makes this place different is the PANCAKES. ˜These were tasty and served with different flavored butters. I'm a big fan of sauces and Tom's had this spicy tartar like sauce. ˜It was delicious and masked the fake crab cake taste. ˜I didn't expect imitation crab meat in my crab cakes!!"
9717,28,2,1,10/22/2010,"Alright place, pumpkin pancakes too tangy. ˜Homefries better than most diners...don't understand the long lines. ˜The free oranges, coffee while waiting on line were a nice touch."
9718,28,5,1,10/19/2010,"The line was long and the food worth the wait. 30 fun minutes outside the place with the chef bringing cookies, fruits and coffee... Awesome!!!"
9719,28,4,1,10/19/2010,"Okay Tom's, I have to admit. It was only a first date, and I'm still on the fence as to if I should call you back or drop you a text, as I know how many other suitors you have. But damn, that Mexican omelet was delicious."
9720,28,5,1,9/24/2010,"If you like pancakes, French toast, or waffles, this is the place. ˜About a dozen different varieties, all of them yummy. ˜Also good are the fries with the spicy mayo, and of course the Cherry Lime Ricky. ˜Arrive before 10 or after 2:30 on weekends if you want to avoid a line (of course, they have chairs and free food for people waiting in line, so it's not the worst experience). ˜Probably the most diverse clientele of any place in the neighborhood--everyone eats at Toms's. Lunch there is good too, but it's not in the same league as the breakfast offerings."
9721,28,5,1,9/20/2010,"I love Tom's. It's definitely worth the wait in line. And while you're waiting, they treat you real nice :) Cookies, coffee, sausage, oranges, strawberries & cream, french fries, etc... If you've never been you probably think I'm kidding. I actually get a little disappointed if there isn't a line. One time Gus even brought us out umbrellas when it was raining! If the lemon ricotta pancakes don't hook you, the environment will. It's a very family/old school diner. It's decorated for every season all year round. They shuffle people in and out like clock work. Food comes out of the kitchen about 5 mins after you order. The menu has all your basics, but there are a few things that you can't get anywhere else. The beef sausage is incredible, my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Also I always go french fries over homefries. Why? Because of the chipotle mayo you dip them in. Nom nom nom. Tom's - 5 stars! Always."
9722,28,3,1,9/13/2010,"I'd give it 3.5 stars, but rounding down just to annoy the acolytes. ˜ I went here recently while visiting NYC. ˜I'm a NY boy who now lives in Cali, and returning to NY always makes me want to move back, but then I remember winters!! ˜ So, thankfully, we visited on a Tuesday late morning, and just strolled in...no wait at all. ˜I had the lemon-ricotta p'cakes and they were yummy-tasty. ˜Bonus points for having real maple syrup. ˜How anyone can ingest that fake sugar-maple flavor crap is beyond me. ˜ Service was friendly and efficient. ˜All in all, a fine place in my book. ˜I'd return if I was in the area, but I wouldn't make a special trip."
9723,28,4,1,9/13/2010,"The line is part of the experience, weird, but true. We waited on a 15-20 minute line, while on line we were served orange slices, coffee, and sausages ... each delicious, and comforting, and fun. If you don't want to wait in line, and don't mind sitting at the little bar (and there are seats available) I recommend this. Usually eggs at a dinner are good, but not overly flavorful, here, the eggs actually taste like something and that something is great!!!! The crab cakes, though fried, are good and the french fries are even better than they look."
9724,28,3,1,9/7/2010,"Maybe it was just the rave reviews I read before going here, but I was sadly disappointed in the quality. I thought it was good, but not worth a huge wait. And nothing close to the best I've ever had. One highly anticipated component was the pancakes. Of which I tried the lemon ricotta, pumpkin walnut, and sweet potato. They were all about average I'd say. The lemon was probably the best, which was totally unexpected. I'm not generally a big fan of lemon. I'd probably give the pancakes a 5/10. The beef sausage was pretty tasty, as was the chipotle mayo type sauce they had on the side. The home fries were a bit mushy and not that tasty, although after dousing them in salt and chipotle mayo they were significantly better.. The orange juice wasn't fresh squeezed and really wasn't even that tasty, and they served it with ice! Which makes it completely unappetizing."
9725,28,5,1,9/5/2010,"This place is exactly what I'm looking for for brunch. Great food, original pancakes/waffles, amazing flavored butters, cheap as all hell. ˜Considering the quality and the price, I'm willing to wait in line for half an hour. The wait staff are very aware of the line situation and try to turn tables very quickly, but I never feel like I'm being pushed out the door. So what if it's not pretty? I don't need ambience to go with my $10 brunch."
9726,28,4,1,9/4/2010,"I hate to do it, but I'm downgrading Tom's, even though I love them, because their delivery blows. ˜The food at Tom's is always great, fast, friendly service, but the delivery food is consistently terrible. ˜The delivery guy is nice and the speed is fine. ˜ I don't know why in the world I keep ordering delivery (actually I do. ˜answer=laziness), but over the last year I have had burnt food, uncooked pancakes to the point of them being batter-y, food that tastes spoiled, food that's cold, been delivered the wrong side more than one, etc. ˜It's so miserable. ˜I never have these problems when I go to the restaurant. ˜Ever. ˜So, if you're thinking delivery, don't. ˜Just hoof it over and wait in line if you want it that bad..."
7499,28,4,1,9/2/2010,"This place is an old school mom and pop diner, the hospitality ˜when you walk in is impressive all the way until you leave. ˜The owner makes everybody feel special and he looks like the kind that would feed a whole family for free if they had no money. ˜ The food has its days, the last time I ate there, it was so so, before that it was great!! ˜I mean when the place is busy, the food is rushed, alot of action going on, you cant take it to heart over a hamburger a little well done or something not to your satisfaction. Overall the place has great food. The place is closed on sundays though, what a bummer"
9727,28,5,1,8/30/2010,"What can I say... If I trusted this place I would be a rolling dough ball!!! I live two blocks from this place on Washington and I am literally scared to pass this place because I DO NOT want to always come here to eat!!! LOL I love the pancakes, espically the Pumpkin Walnut! The chipole dressing that they have, I have been tempted on numerous occasions to take but I want EVERYONE to enjoy it as well!!! Cannot wait to go back this weekend!! YES I am in there!!!"
9728,28,2,1,8/28/2010,"diners fall under one of only two possibilities..... old school crap ass diners with unequivocal food old school diners with heavy, homestyle cooking.. nothing too fancy (obviously as fancy is irrelevant to diners) upon entering Tom's... I quickly became judgmental. ˜definitely looked a little beaten around the path a few times. ˜should we stay or leave? ˜quickly, our attention was captured by a warm man who kindly was showing us to our seats, while offering us a sampling plate of sausages. ˜i took one bite (for taste of course)... it was the most fattening thing I'd ever tasted... all the more salty & delicious. ˜ i didn't think the food was anything special or to die for. ˜while i appreciate the little freebies of food here and there... (and also the nice antibacterial spray was a nice touch).. i wasn't wooed in the least bit. ˜my omelette was jane plain ... with an iceberg salad tossed with a few diced tomatoes. ˜simplicity goes a long mile, but without the freshness factor in the actual ingredients, it will remain a plain jane dish. ˜On the other frontier, the sweet potatoe pancakes was the true starlet. ˜So simple and yet so graciously pleasant in your mouth. ˜Had a nice sweetness and texture that was distant from its traditional smooth, fluff, buttery norm. ˜Not too sweet either.... I don't think they added any extra sugar (at least not a ton of it), so all that goodness appeared to be natural from the sweet potatoes. ˜ if there is one thing to love... it's the love that permeates in the air here. ˜Expect the family style atmosphere, as if your grandparents are taking care of you. ˜while good & gravy, this place is simply not my usual forte. ˜and that's ok. ˜i like my brunch scene with a bit more jazz and drama. ˜this place takes you back to the brady bunch days. ˜and who doesn't like that?"
9729,28,3,1,8/24/2010,"I've been to Tom's a handful of times now, most recently for Mothers day. My opinions are back and forth but hereitgoes: Tom's is basically the old school diner (some people say 50's, but this place has actually been operating since the 30s!) in an increasingly new school neighborhood; which means it is a small place with a big clientele. The food is fine, breakfast all day with some pretty cool specials (ricotta pancakes, huevos rancheros are pretty damn good), and also the regular diner food with a great soda bar offering egg creams and cherry lime rickys. You can walk out of there spending about $10, maybe less, for a good amount of food. The price would be fine if the space was a little calmer and more laid back diner-ish, but it isn't. It can often take the form of a giant feeding frenzy on the weekends. Lines can be long (15-20 minutes), the space is cramped and the service is a little rushed. One thing that exacerbates the whole stressful feel of the place is the over-kitchiness hanging all over the walls. The place is busy and rushed enough as it is without having ""a bunch of crazy crap all over walls."" The hospitality is the rock of this place. Being used to the upstate NY and small-town ideals of actually being polite and friendly to your customers, the managerial staff here, which includes the owners, makes me feel happy about being there and will interact with you as if they actually want your business (I know, a shock in Brooklyn). So yea, the short of it: good food, great owners, but rushed, packed, and a little frantic at times."
9730,28,4,1,8/23/2010,"Who doesn't love Tom's? The food is pretty good, the service is exceptional and you can't help but love the owner. The place rocks! The only down sides are the wait to get in (offset by the free coffee, orange slices and cookies), and the smell that seems to cling to you after you leave. Well worth the visit!!"
9731,28,4,1,8/15/2010,"Tom's is great for brunch. The food is tasty and the prices are good. I've been here for a burger and fries before, but I prefer the thick French toast with specialty butters and flavorful sausage any day! This spot is consistently good, and always packed but I've never had to wait long. If you haven't checked it out and you live close, definitely do so."

9733,28,4,1,8/12/2010,"Love, love, love Tom's. ˜I almost never go when everyone else typically does so I tend to avoid the long, long, long brunch line that I pass by on most Saturdays. ˜If you go during the week, you'll get in right away without dealing with the weekend brunchers. ˜Their pancakes are so good and they give you different types of butters to accompany them. ˜I like their turkey bacon because its very meaty. ˜And of course, you have to try a cherry lime rickey."
9734,28,5,1,8/12/2010,"the food is pretty good for a diner, but not good enough to warrant five stars. this place gets five stars for gus. i love gus. i only go to tom's when gus is there (he's not there on sundays as far as i know). i often go to tom's when there's a line around the corner. if free cookies, strawberries and whipped cream, sausage, french fries, coffee, tea and gus aren't enough to keep you waiting, there must be something wrong with you. i usually get the 2 x 2 x 2, which is a breakfast of two pancakes, two eggs and two pieces of ˜meat (more than two if you order bacon). they'll even add chocolate chips to your pancakes if you ask. i normally don't like flavored butter on my pancakes, but i like it here. i don't usually like chipotle sauce with my fries, but i like it here. i think it's because gus makes everything taste better."
9735,28,4,1,8/12/2010,"While not the Tom's Diner of the Suzanne Vega song (that one's on the Upper West Side and can be seen in Seinfeld, she told the Times), this Tom's is a wonderful little diner where wonderfully friendly people cook and serve wonderful diner food.

9736,28,4,1,8/11/2010,"The food is great, the service staff is friendly. ˜The only thing that prevents it from being 5-stars is the long lines it always has and I feel it's hours are inconsistent (but that may be just me). ˜If you are in the nieghborhood, go here... strongly recommended. ˜And if you are on that long line, they'll give you cookies. I understand that long lines can be a sign of quality, but after a certain point, I simply do not like waiting to be seated. ˜Tom's would benefit greatly from expanding their place... although they would probably still be a line to get in even if they doubled their capacity."
9737,28,5,1,8/11/2010,"Even if the food wasn't terrific, I'd still have to give Tom's 5 stars because the people there were so darn nice. As we stood in line, we were offered coffee, orange slices, cookies, and fries with dip. They clearly are interested in making waiting as pleasant and experience as possible and aren't worried that you'll fill up, because actually, the line moves right along. The inside is a bit cramped, but then, it's a typical diner. Diners are normally cozy. And since this one is so friendly, it added to the ""we're all one big family"" atmosphere. Everything we ordered was yummy. Sweet potato pancakes, special pancakes, broccoli and cheese omelet, crab cakes Florentine, lime rickeys, grits, home fries... and we ate all of it - big portions, but soooo good there was no way any of it was getting left on the plate. I loved the little plate that came along with lime, strawberry, and cinnamon butter. Nice touch - the cinnamon butter went great with my sweet potato pancakes. Tom's does a great brunch business and it is easy to see why. Even though it was crazy, busy, we never felt rushed. The service keeps things running smoothly, and although they are probably running their toushes off, there were always smiles all around. Don't go to Tom's if you aren't prepared to wait. But if you are, your patience will be well rewarded."
9738,28,5,1,8/9/2010,"Me and my girlfriend wanted good pancakes so i told her to google good pancakes brooklyn toms came up i lived in brooklyn almost my whole ˜life never heard of toms ... i said lets go we tried we loved it .... and by ˜far best pancakes i ever tasted fluffy and great tasteing ... they gave us differet flavored butter i had apple cinamonn awesome ,,,,, my girlfriend had eggs and fries she loved hers also ........food came out fast and fresh bill was cheap and the owner was very friendly ..... great place to eat ,,,,,,,,,thumbs up ˜ ,,,, am only disappointed about how long it took me to find this place, thanks to my girlfriends research i now know where to go to eat ggooooodddd ˜ pancakes and food :) thanks tom"
9739,28,5,1,8/3/2010,"I can't believe I've never reviewed Tom's as long as I've been yelping. Shame on me! Where to start. I've been lucky enough that every time I went, the line was small or nonexistent. Staff is so good. They serve you cookies while you wait and during your meal. I've had the pleasure of meeting Tom too. It's rare to see an owner ˜so invested in their endeavor, particularly when it's been and continues to be so successful. Decor is outdated but it completely suits this place. I've actually grown fond of the Christmas lights and star autographs. The vanilla egg cream. Oh lawd! I love it. I haven't found anywhere else that can match this. My breakfast staple usually is poached or scrambled eggs with bacon. Always done right. Always delivered under 10mns, sometimes 5mn. They must have a speedy Gonzalez working in the kitchen because meals always come out fast. S.O.'s tasted most of the pancakes and so far has not been disappointed. Despite the lines & constant traffic, they are never in a rush to kick you out. I've had one afternoon where me and the girls lingered without even knowing until the place closed."
9740,28,5,1,7/31/2010,"I think Valerie V. and other yelpers who, like her, don't love tom's are what we in this day and age refer to as ""haters"". I love ""the Usual"" as well. I live a block away from them, and go all the time. However, Tom's is one of a kind. Obviously, (this tip is for Valerie and the other slow people around these parts), don't go there if you're in a rush. Do you have a lazy sunday ever? Go then. You have a late weekday morning? Go. Wanna eat brunch late on a saturday and not wait on line? GOOOO! Just because you have to wait on line, doesn't mean the service is lacking- they even bring you food and coffe/tea as you wait. Again, contrary to what Valerie said, the food is cheap: an order of pancakes for $6.50? And, YES, they actually are amazing."
9741,28,2,1,7/29/2010,"As an update to my review of Tom's, I'd like to recommend an extra tasty alternative that sits only a few blocks away. The Usual (Yelp Link: yelp.com/biz/the-usual-b?) sits on Vanderbilt between St. Marks and Prospect Place. Family owned and super friendly service not to mention their food is more delicious than Tom's, they serve chicken nuggets (who doesn't LOVE chicken nugs?!) AND you can sit outside on their new patio! They've even installed speakers for your music lovin' ears. Now I know you can't get that at Tom's so walk on over to The Usual just a few blocks away. Your taste-buds will not be disapointed."
9742,28,3,1,7/26/2010,"A friend suggested Tom's for breakfast because it's in between our homes in Park Slope and Fort Greene. ˜Tom's has the atmosphere of a local establishment -- it's won many accolades and has been around for quite some time. ˜The staff is nice and the customers are also unassuming and a pleasant crowd -- we all joined the waiters in singing ""Happy Birthday"" to one patron. I had the walnut pumpkin waffles. ˜My friend had scrambled eggs, hash browns, and toast. ˜The Belgian waffle was good and very filling. ˜The eggs looked good. ˜A waiter came at the end to serve us complementary cookies. The place is nice, the service is good, and the food is decent. ˜Worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood."
9743,28,4,1,7/23/2010,"Yum. As a someone who lived close to Mike's in Clinton Hill for the past four years, I really needed to find some diner food in my new area. Tom's lived up to the dream. I went on a Saturday morning (oh yes, very busy) and had some special with pancakes, eggs and bacon. Oh so good! I can't wait to go back for lunch (Burger and a milkshake? Yes please!) I also want to try the Cherry Lime Ricky. It sounds delish!"
9744,28,5,1,7/21/2010,"I have been here twice at this point as Tom's is down the street from one my BFF's apts. ˜Everytime I think of it, Suzanne Vega pops into my head (right?!). First, there is usually a line. ˜However, the people at Tom's actually feed you in the line. ˜They come by with trays of coffee, juice, water, cookies, etc. ˜It is awesome. ˜In fact, the longer you're in the line, the more you get fed for free and the smaller your bill is. ˜The place inside is small, cramped, and hideously decorated, but gets away with it because it can be described as kitschy diner chic. The food is awesome, especially for a diner. ˜The menu is enormous, with everything you could ever want. ˜I have only ever eaten breakfast, so it's all I can speak to. ˜The pancakes are good (my friends are fans of the pumpkin, though we've been lustfully eyeing the lemon ricotta). ˜The challah french toast is good. ˜The waffles are huge and light, just as they should be. ˜The flavored whipped butters are delicious (strawberry being my personal fav). ˜The sausages are huge and perfectly crisp. ˜The homefries are OMG-capital-A-mazing! ˜They have scallions and bell peppers in them and are the best I have ever had in life, for realz. ˜ Even cooler, they sell old soda fountain drinks like lime rickeys, malts, and egg creams. Even better? ˜You can have a meal there for single digits. ˜Really. ˜And be soooo full. ˜It's the only thing on my to-do list when I'm in Brooklyn. ˜Go now!"
9745,28,4,1,7/12/2010,"We thought it was going to be a typical diner experience and got much more. When we arrived there was a 20 min line out the door. Waitress came through the line a couple different times offering coffee, orange slices, cookies, and French fries (careful about the jalape?o dipping sauce) - really nice touch. Hueovs rancheros and egg white omelet exceeded expectations. Huevos rancheros were spicy and thick and delicious; egg white omelet was perfectly cooked, not too heavy, and just the right size with the toast and home fries. Lots of charm, friendly fast service, would def go back again. As with most diners, coffee was weak and bland."
9746,28,5,1,7/8/2010,"Brooklyn, the more I know you, the more I'm learning to love you. My friend Brianna suggested that I check out Tom's for breakfast and I'm so glad that I did. This is the kind of place that you read about, the kind of place that all the locals know, the kind of place gives you a taste of what the neighborhood is all about. Tom's is personality refined. The decorations, the wait staff, the overcrowded eating area, the constant lines out the door; it's all here. I saw a sign with a special on it that sounded like an interesting idea: a Spicy Mexican Chicken Cheese omlette with home fries. Add some whole wheat toast great tasting coffee and you'll find how enjoyable a breakfast can be. The spice level was just right; enough to wake your brain up, but not enough to ruin your enjoyment of the dish. The coffee was mild and great, I could have continued drinking it all day, but wanted to move on and let some others enjoy Tom's. I topped my breakfast off with a Cherry-Lime ""Ricky"" to go.. a cool, refreshing fizzy drink that cooled me off as I left Tom's. Any trip to NY won't be complete with out going back to Tom's. It's a great neighborhood institution that everyone needs to try at least once."
9747,28,4,1,7/6/2010,"adorable kitschy diner with crazy signs advertising most of their stuff on their menu, ie banana walnut pancakes! ˜cherry lime rickeys! ˜everything with exclamation points! ˜the hardest part was choosing something finally. I wish i had gone with the pancakes but instead opted for a plain belgian waffle, which tasted best with the lemon flavored butter but was most highly impressed with my friend's fries. ˜AMAZING battered fries, and next time I go I will get one serving of those alone."
9748,28,5,1,7/5/2010,"Huge fan of this little gem for oh so many reasons. I'd say in short they just ""get it"". ˜ We got to Tom's amidst 98 degree heat....no exaggeration.....that was the real temp. There was a line out the door and a 15 min wait for a table. During our wait a waitress came out with free food, and cold drinks of water no less than 4 times.....you've got to be kidding me! Thats how its done and I have to believe thats how its been done at the neighborhood favorite for the last 74 yrs. I had the sweet potato pancakes with blueberries and strawberries with a side of turkey chorizo......friggin amazing! Gooey, and the perfect blend of sweet and savory. The pancake batter has a sour yummy tone to it that's perfectly balanced by the fruit and the sweet potato. My girlfriend had a cheddar spinach omelette ˜with a side of grits that was killer, too. We adorned the grits with a chipolte ˜mayonnaise like sauce that just hit the spot. To top it off we also shared a vanilla egg cream which according to google contains neither egg nor cream.....whoda thunk? So, yeah....if your looking for that wonderfully special local authentic ""find"" look no further than Tom's. Cant wait to return!"
9749,28,4,1,7/4/2010,"Legendary. And almost always as good as the hype. The Mexican omelet is my go-to. They are ultra friendly and usually fast, though service can be unfocused and inefficient at times. Bottom line: Good enough for Susanne Vega, good enough for me."
9750,28,4,1,7/2/2010,"Went here today after a 1-year hiatus of not going and I must say Tom's does have one of the best breakfast options in Brooklyn. I ordered the challah french toast with bananas, beef sausage with lemon, corned beef hash extra crispy, and a cup of joe to top it off. Service is quick, but they forgot the bananas on my french toast! =( Coming here on a slightly less busy time is perfect although we didn't get the cookies and oranges while waiting in line. I would still highly recommend Tom's!"
9751,28,4,1,6/29/2010,"What can be said that hasn't already been about this place! It's a treasure trove in Brooklyn, serving some of the best, cheapest breakfast you can get. EVERYTHING on this menu is good...and I'd know, I've had most of it already. The pancakes are great (especially with the different butters), the hash is great, the corned beef is great, the omelettes are great, the sausage is great...seriously, nothing here is bad! What's more than the food (what, more important than food!! - ok maybe not ""more"", but ""in addition"") is the spirit of the place. ˜Tom and his staff make you feel as though you were curled up in your home's breakfast nook...which is a feat considering this place is small and packed! Whether it's the bites of food and coffee served while waiting in line, the speedy service, the attention to details and wanting to ensure every customer is happy, or yes even the great food - this place is a breakfast mecca. Cash only. Deal with it :)"
9752,28,5,1,6/18/2010,"So so so so so delicious. ˜This place is amazing. ˜The third time I went here I was meeting a friend who was nearly an hour late. ˜Which sucked. ˜But the owners gave me lots of free slices of oranges (which they hand out to everyone in line), as many free coffees as I wanted while I waited at the bar area, and even came around with the most delicious lemony sausage samples I've ever had! ˜Then my yummy, cheesy, delicious omelette came to the table and the bill was only around $8 for my share! ˜Not including coffee! Tom's is the BEST."
9753,28,4,1,6/17/2010,"I had a friend visiting from out of town so I hit up yelp to find a good brunch place nearby. ˜Tom's had consistently good reviews so we went there. ˜ Probably because it was a Thursday, late-ish morning, we didn't have to wait at all. ˜ Our waiter was attentive, friendly and helpful. ˜I went with the waiters recommendation and got the crab cake breakfast and my friend got the blueberry/parmesan/something else pancakes with the butter assortment. ˜ Everything was delicious. ˜The home fries and egg were delicious. ˜The crab cakes were tasty and much better than I expected from some little breakfast joint. ˜My friend was practically orgasmic over the pancakes (she REALLY likes pancakes) and our coffee cups were never empty. Over all it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be dragging my roomie there some time in the near future."
9754,28,4,1,6/17/2010,A consistent and classic crowd-pleaser.
9755,28,4,1,6/16/2010,"Decided to stop by here before an afternoon at the Brooklyn Museum. I waited in line for about 10 minutes, then found out I could skip the line if I wanted a seat by the counter. Sounds good to me! I couldn't decide between the harvest pancakes and the sweet potato ones, but in the end opted for sweet potato with blueberries. Perfect potion, loved the flavored butters (lime, strawberry, and cinnamon when I went). I didn't really taste much sweet potatoes in my pancakes, but it was a scrumptious and a hearty brunch. I felt like a happy farmer. Plus, the servers were really helpful, and people in line kept pointing at my stack of pancakes...so I can't complain."
9756,28,5,1,6/14/2010,"Nothing beats the authenticity of this place. This place is original and unique in its own way. I have ate here countless times, mostly for breakfast and brunch. You can expect to see a line outside and around the block from this restaurant every weekend! They offer you orange slices and coffee to those waiting outside, so the wait feels like nothing. The owner frequently strolls the Diner and visits with some of the guests and is very friendly. The service is fast and the food is deliciously fresh! This place has a special homely feeling that beats all other Diners."
9757,28,3,1,6/14/2010,"The pancakes were tasty, but by no means the best I've had. I really wanted to try the pumpkin pancakes since they're kind of hard to come by, especially not in the fall. I don't like walnuts, however, and they informed me they couldn't do pumpkin pancakes without the nuts because they were already mixed together. Wasn't too happy about that, but got over it and went for the sweet potato pancakes. They were good and cooked well, but definitely didn't live up to all the hype. ˜ I'd go back to try some of the other pancakes, but don't think it'll make it ˜to the top of my list."
9758,28,5,1,6/11/2010,"My boyfriend and I looooove Toms. Their cranberry and sweet corn pancakes are great, the huevos rancheros are pretty rocking, even the chili omlet I had last week was great. The decor makes me feel like I'm at a yard sale, the service is excellent too. Any time we wait for our food more than 5 minutes the manager brings us something yummy to munch on, like cookies or cinnamonbutter toast. They ˜also make home made butters that are so yummy, and their chipolte mayo is something my boyfriend craves. Even when there is a line, the staff bring around cookies and coffee. *note* we've found going on Sunday mornings is leas crowded than Saturdays. But always worth any wait."
9759,28,5,1,6/9/2010,"Let me start off by saying I love pancakes. They are on my Top 10 list of favorite foods. ˜Between nostalgia & just pure awesome tastiness, 99.8% of the time pancakes win in my book. The minute I walked into Tom's, I fell in love. ˜It's like stepping back in time. ˜A counter with swivel stools, tiny booths, friendly faces & amazing smells. ˜It's always decorated to the nines for whatever holiday may be approaching. ˜But of course people don't come here to just sit and chat. This isn't your typical diner food, people. This is life-changing, well made, you won't need to eat for the rest of the day you are so full food. The fact that you can order breakfast here at anytime of day already gets a win in my book but OH MAN is the food good. ˜I of course had the pancakes that were out of this world - fluffy, hot & amazing. ˜They could have told me that a small child loses a finger every time they make an order of pancakes & I wouldn't have stopped eating them. ˜They have different butters & types of pancakes to choose from which makes it interesting. ˜I want to try to the lemon ricotta ones next time I go. ˜I've heard the egg creams & other drinks are amazing. I can't wait to try EVERYTHING on the menu. ˜Also, their coffee is pretty damn amazing. I live very close to this place & know that the wait, esp on the weekends for brunch can be INSANE. ˜I've been there as early as 8am on a Saturday and didn't have to wait. ˜But if you aren't a morning person or don't want to wait, I suggest going during the less busy times."
9760,28,2,1,5/22/2010,"Maybe it was an ""off day."" ˜It started so well too. ˜We were waiting in the long line that extended from inside the restaurant to the outside sidewalk and the waiter kept bringing us appetizers while we waited! Yummy! cookies, orange slices, cinnamon french toast... (!?) ˜What an incredibly awesome thing to do. ˜Shouldn't EVERY restaurant do this?? But it was down hill from there. ˜Tried an egg cream for the first time. Are they supposed to be room temperature? YECH. ˜Eggs benedict had two slices of Hormel ham. ˜One of the eggs was over cooked and hard boiled while the potatoes were undercooked. ˜The pancakes were good, and the fruit butter was tasty. But all in all - disappointing. The bill was nice though. 30 bucks."
9761,28,4,1,5/22/2010,"had the peppers and onion omelet with homefries and a side-order of turkey sausage, crisp on the outside, perfectly tender and seasoned on the inside, not your usual rubbery diner sausage went in the middle of a workday, no problem getting a seat will definitely have to try the cherry lime ricky, lemon ricotta hotcakes, and the chocolate egg cream...never had those before"
9762,28,5,1,5/22/2010,"I've always heard how amazing Tom's breakfast is. When I lived in the area I attempted to go there for brunch a couple of times but found that the wait was WAY too long for me. So I finally came here for lunch on a weekday and immediately decided I had to have the eggs florentine. Our waiter was all excited about my choice and even delivered my dish while singing a little song. So funny. And holy crap was that an excellent plate of food! Tom's definitely makes one of the best eggs florentine that I've ever tasted. The eggs were perfectly cooked - not too runny, not too hard - and there was plenty of Hollandaise sauce. I hate it when places skimp on the sauce. But the best part was the spinach: it was creamed. YUM YUM YUM. I mean...it's clearly a heart-attack-on-a-plate kind of dish, but if you're gonna go out, it may as well be eating this."
9763,28,3,1,5/19/2010,"So, it's awesome that you get fed in line at Tom's. Their turnaround rate is unbelievably fast, and before you know it, you're eating. The folks who work at Tom's are wonderful and very personable... But ultimately everyone is there to eat, and the food is just very mediocre compared to all of the excellent brunch that's 10 minutes walk away. I would like to say that I'm more into Tom's, but I'm not."
9764,28,5,1,5/19/2010,"There really isn't anything more that I can say about Tom's that hasn't already been said. ˜I turned my roommates on to the place one day, not long after we moved in, and we haven't looked back. ˜We bring visitors here (once our guests requested we go here every day of their stay and we ended up going 3/4 mornings), we bring our hungry selves here, and we recommend it to anyone who hasn't gone here before. ˜ The service is amazing - cookies, coffee, sausages, fries, and oranges served to patrons waiting in the cold during the winter, in the rain during the spring, and the heat during the summer. ˜The food is amazingly priced and also does its job of hitting the spot after a quiet night of heavy drinking. ˜ This is definitely a gem and institution in the Crown Heights/Prospect Heights neighborhood. ˜How can it not be when it serves delicious food and provides the best service in the world. ˜Let me tell you about this one time that I was about to leave and the place was so packed that I couldn't get my winter coat on. ˜On my way out next to the line of waiting patrons, the retired proprietor was shaking hands with leaving customers. ˜As I was about to give him my hand, he takes my coat from my arm, and helps me into it! ˜No other diner makes you feel more at home - not in New York, not in California."
9765,28,3,1,5/7/2010,"They are very friendly, and the place is really cute, but the food is really just mediocre... and clearly over -rushed. sure we will go again... but only because we live around the corner."
9766,28,5,1,5/3/2010,"Definitely worth the hype. We went on a Saturday and the wait was about an hour, but they bring out little goodies for you while you wait. The French toast is fantastic, and even more fantastic are all of their flavored butters. The cherry lime rickey is delicious as well. Love!"
9767,28,5,1,4/30/2010,"So tasty, so cheap, such amazing service. ˜The line gets a bit bothersome, and its definitely gotten way more yuppie and mom-ed out in the past year or two, but the food, and the amazing service are worth it. ˜The plus about the line, is that they will come around with various treats (ie. coffee, sausage, cookies) to make it worthwhile! Can't go wrong with any of their pancakes, and if you're feeling bold (or indecisive) go with the 2 by 2 by 2, and get some of everything! I love how the place is so ridiculously overstaffed that multiple waiters come by to give you whatever you need - everything from refills of water to orange slices, wet naps, and even cookies! Bottom line, if you're in the the 'hood, and craving breakfast, you can't beat Toms."
9768,28,4,1,4/28/2010,"Of course I love Tom's... It's right down the block from me. They always have the wretched line going around the corner on the weekends, hence why I tend to go during the week...same great service same great food. Try the sweet potato pancakes or the harvest pancakes. Even if you don't see something you want on the menu just ask if they have it, they are great about making your menu work for you!!"
9769,28,3,1,4/25/2010,"Went here with friends for a Sunday brunch. ˜Service (on the weekends, anyway) is harried but has good intentions. The host made a special effort to seat our party at tables next to one another, which was not only incredibly considerate but a monumental feat. ˜ Loved the coffee-while-you-wait service. ˜I ordered a bacon omelette, which, according to the signage should have knocked my socks off, but I found it extremely overcooked. ˜Too bad-- having come from NJ, I usually judge a diner on its eggs. ˜However, my friends enjoyed their food, the home fries were decent, and the place gets points for being an institution and having a broad and interesting menu. ˜I'd like to come back here some time-- say, a Tuesday mid-morning-- and see how they do their eggs when they're not getting slammed."
9770,28,5,1,4/22/2010,"Perfect for a post botanical gardens brunch! -Free cookies and coffee while waiting in the (fast-moving) line. -So many options to choose from, deliciouss food, and large portions -Complimentary cherry-lime rickey, which basically tastes like a Shirley Temple, but a little more tangy (this probably doesn't always happen) -Friendly service and fun decor What more could a girl ask for? Oh...and you should try the lemon ricotta pancakes..they're delish!"
9771,28,4,1,4/20/2010,"A bit of a goat rodeo, but the old school feel and the fast service makes it totally worth navigating the crowds. I've been here a couple of times; the food is good overall...but the pancakes are amazing. So many varieties, and the three buttery sides make every bite an adventure. When friends are in town, we hit Tom's for good food, good value, good service and great atmosphere"
9772,28,4,1,4/16/2010,"Tom's was the first place my girlfriend and I ate at when we arrived to Brooklyn, and Yelpers are correct about this place when it comes to quality of the food and service. I am a Eggs Benedict man, and although it was not the best i have ever had, it was still really good. I love the home feeling i get eating here, its so welcoming and comfortable. This is a place we will be coming back to in the future."
9773,28,5,1,4/12/2010,"tom-may! man, oh man, this place is great. ˜on saturdays when i've decided to hit up the brooklyn museum or the botanic garden, i always make sure to leave a little early so i can go to tom's for breakfast/lunch/brunch. here's what you'll get: ˜complementary snacks while waiting in the ever-present line (these include but are not limited to sausages, coffee, orange slices), service with a smile, and one of the most kitschy insane dining areas ever. ˜ ˜ ordering is hard because everything on the menu is delish. ˜i recommend going with ˜6-8 friends so you can all get something different and each off each other's plates. ˜also, yes the butter is insane. ˜i could eat the cinnamon butter on a spoon. ˜why even bother putting it on a carb? ˜ and while i'm not that partial to it, some of my friends swear by the lime rickeys. ˜you might wanna give it a try (especially if you're falling behind on your cavity quota for the year). ˜:-)"
9774,28,3,1,3/31/2010,"Food was ok. Wait staff was very nice. Decor is very old fashioned. I did enjoy this place but they dont take credit, only cash. I still recommend. Cafe orlin in east village but if u wanna stay in brooklyn this is great."
9775,28,3,1,3/30/2010,"Don't much like their fries. Their fries are sort of dirty, crunchy, and not so flavorful, the only positive thing I found was that they don't go soggy. In addition to the fries I had a BLT which was tasty, but not enough bacon. At the counter they gave me a glass of either hot chocolate, french vanilla cappuccino, or something like that, which was rather tasty. Def on the A-OK list for me."
9776,28,5,1,3/29/2010,"This is my second time to this restaurant. ˜I love their pancakes! They have different types of butter, that is so cool. ˜ This time when I went I notice their service is so cool and attentive to their customers. ˜They provided various tastes of their fries and other food. ˜The wait staff is fast and attentive to your every need."
9777,28,2,1,3/28/2010,"Great if you want sloppy New York dinner food or an egg cream, but not so much if your palate craves a nicely prepared Sunday brunch. Food is oily, ugly and nothing to savor. I ordered pancakes with a side of scrambled eggs. I can't even remember what kind of pancakes they were cause they soooo uneventful. I just ate it really quickly so I could be full and not feel like I wasted my money. The coffee was ok, but not really. Sad though, cause the customer service is GREAT! The place is cute, comfortable and kitch. I'm just not dying to go back."
9778,28,4,1,3/25/2010,"I love the cranberry waffle, the pumpkin walnut pancakes, the eggs Benedict/florentine, and the bacon omelette. You should definitely try the cherry lime rickey and the egg cream (which tastes like carbonated egg nog). I just don't like the wait in the weekends. But you can't win em all!"
9779,28,5,1,3/23/2010,"The snack guy GAVE US a plate of fries while we waited! The WHOLE THING! I was ridiculously hungover... so this was the best thing to ever happen to me, that day at least."
9780,28,4,1,3/21/2010,"This place rocks!!! Lovely selection of homemade items, charming decor and absolutely one of the friendlist staffs anywhere in AMERICA. Recommend Lime Rickey's - make you feel like a kid EGG Creams - What I imagines this drink to taste like Turkey Melt - Great Sandwich - made me sleepy afterwards Breakfast - almost anything - love the beef sausages (albeit I do not eat pork so this might be a bit biased of an opinion)"
9781,28,3,1,3/12/2010,"pros: It's good breakfast food, served incredibly fast. We came on a weekday afternoon, which means no lines, no fuss. We got down to business and ate. cons: I don't get what the one $ sign is all about, but I paid a pretty penny for my lunch. I did get a bunch of sides like mac and cheese and corned beef hash, but, still, the place is not cheap. Nor is it so amazingly good that I don't mind paying that much. overall: I'm glad I went and that I went w/o having to stand in line. However, it doesn't seem justified that others would have to just to be able to eat here."
9782,28,5,1,3/10/2010,"my boyfriend lives in brooklyn, so we eat here often. what a gem!! on weekends you may find a long line, but it is really worth it. sometimes you get offered free coffee and something to snack on while you wait. the atmosphere is unique and fun. you eat a yummy breakfast, and you get very good service. and free cookies. props to the older lady (tom's widow?) who gives you a free lollipop when you leave."
9783,28,2,1,3/7/2010,"My roommate and I have lived down the street from the famous Tom's for eight months, and, feeling obligated to try this notorious brunch spot, finally decided we'd be willing to put up with the wait this morning (they are now open on Sundays and it was beautiful out, after all). ˜ We waited in line for about 30 minutes, and were thanked for waiting when we were seated, which was nice. ˜But this was not a relaxing brunch! ˜Yes, you feel like you're in someone's living room (actually, it feels more like your grandmother's basement), but that living room is packed with people eager to take the chair you've got. ˜Our table was adjacent to the queue of brunch goers that streams all the way into the restaurant, which felt very strange. ˜Our waiter (not necessarily the same one every time) came exactly three times--once to pour our coffee, once to take our order, and once to bring our food--and the owner/manager-seeming guy, while moving people in and out, kept his eye on our plates to put the check down on our table as soon as that last bit of toast had been swallowed. ˜ The food was good but not remarkable, in my opinion (I had a veggie omelet and home fries; my roommate had french toast), and it was all just too rushed. ˜I'd much rather brunch somewhere quieter, with more room, where I can sit and have that second (or third) cup of coffee before I leave. Basically, glad to have tried it but won't go back."
9784,28,5,1,3/5/2010,"Good food, good service! ˜Everything was prompt and delicious."
9785,28,4,1,3/3/2010,"This place is great, and if it weren't overcrowded, would be a top choice. It's a basic diner that does the little things right - like adding beef and turkey sausage to the menu. And serving cool versions of pancakes. They even have crab and fish cakes, to go with the eggs - which come with a great spicy sauce. Nothing is mind blowing - but everything is above par. Which, in the world of overpriced NY restaurant disappointments, makes Tom's a find. Step inside, you'll know this is the real deal: No designer, no executive chef or fancy menu-writer. Nothing's dusted, crusted, topped or sprinkled. But the place has character, earned over time, and everything is cooked just fine. I love this place. (That being said, though, I wouldn't wait in line around any block for any pancakes, anywhere.)"
9786,28,2,1,2/21/2010,"Haiku Review: Yeah, cool atmosphere. But lame waiter and dull eggs make for a whack brunch. PS I only went here once and to be fair, the coffee was pretty good. The waiter was so lame though! Dude answered his cell phone mid-order, walked away to continue conversation, and then went to a different table."
9787,28,5,1,2/16/2010,This has to be one of the best restaurants that I have ever been to. Tom's prides itself on customer service and boy does it deliver. As I waited on line the staff would serve you food and coffee free of charge. Now how many place can claim to do that. The food was great and served fast. All through the meal the staff would check up on me to see how my experience was. This please is totally worth the trip to Brooklyn
9788,28,3,1,2/14/2010,"The old owners were really nice and everything, and the place has definite, definite appeal because of it's old fashioned homey-ness, and the menu is kind if fun in it's lengthy pancakeness and all, but the food just isn't that good. ˜It's decent diner food, mabye even good, but not VERY good. ˜The pancakes taste like they are made with generic Bisquick or bleached white flour, but the multiple butters makes up for it. ˜The chili omelet is good, in a canned chili kind of way. ˜So if you're looking for a particular charm, okay. ˜Excellent food, no."
9789,28,5,1,2/6/2010,"This little diner gets 5 stars for atmosphere alone. From the inviting workers to the warm, homey ambience, you feel as if you walked into someone's dining room. Tom's offers basic diner fare but boy, they sure know what they're doing! Choosing from the three delicious butters they give you to put on your waffles, pancakes, or whatever blows my mind! So I put on all three of course. The lemon-ricotta pancakes were delectable and were perfect paired with their world famous cherry-lime ricky. You could definately bet on me coming back."
9790,28,4,1,2/6/2010,"Toms gives you a warm feeling as soon as you walk in. ˜The friendly service, christmas lights, and tiny booths remind you of a simpler time. ˜It makes us want to write a poem.... Toms we love you so, we even come during the snow. We like to eat so many things- pancakes, eggs, and onion rings Your delicious beverages quench our thirst and that is why your thought of first Whether its a hangover cure or brunch date we choose you...its always worth the wait. ˜ We enjoy your little sausage treats - because you have a nice selection of meats Corned beef hash, burgers, or pork with your hands or a fork! The bottom line is...""your food is yummy"" so thank you Toms from my tummy!!! xoxo"
9791,28,3,1,2/4/2010,"Don't get it. ˜Shane's is so much better and serves the same kind of food. Okay, the atmosphere is kitschy fun, and I like the egg cream sodas. The food is just all right though. ˜ There is nothing wrong with this place--although i did see a cockroach on the bar/counter once many, many years ago. Why anyone would want to eat the icky industrial cookies they give away sometimes is beyond me but its sweet that they offer them. Burgers are better at Shanes, at Zaytoons, were better at Homage even. Eggs better next door at Shanes too. What's to like then? ˜Its a great place to take guests who want to have a traditional diner experience a sort of Americana moment. ˜The service is beyond attentive, and you get the warm fuzzy feeling of eating in a place that has been there forever."
9792,28,4,1,2/2/2010,"After reading the mostly glowing reviews of Tom's by fellow Yelpers, I was definitely looking forward to a mid-afternoon post-Brooklyn Museum meal here with my boyfriend on Saturday. Let it be known: Tom's delivered! After a short walk from the musuem, we saw a line outside a fairly non-descript store-front. I knew it had to be Tom's and despite the below-freezing temp, I was actually excited--if there's a line outside a diner, it has to be good (in my experience). I told my boyfriend we could go somewhere else if he didn't want to wait, but after reading the specials on the whiteboard outside, he assured me could withstand the cold. After less than ten minutes we were ushered inside where a nice busboy served everyone complimentary coffee. I kept watching all of the food being served and got really excited. We were seated (total wait time: 15 minutes) but only after a nice chat with the owner/manager (?) about what he recommended. Me: Chocolate Chip-Banana/Walnut pancakes (3) with three kinds of butter--cinamon, strawberry and peach (I think). The pancakes were perfect--fluffy yet dense and filling--and the combo of the chocolate, bananas and walnuts was delish. BF: Western omelette w/french fries and toast--he loved it and unfortunately only shared a few of his fries with me. I would have tried the omelette but I'm a vegetarian so no luck there with the ham. The service was quick and efficient and friendly--no frills. And our meal was cheap! $16.90 total. If I lived in Brooklyn I would be a regualr at Tom's--will definitely make the trip from the FiDi again soon though!"
9793,28,5,1,1/31/2010,"Best diner ever. Seriously. The owner is the nicest guy I've ever met in the restaurant business. They served us sausages, coffee, and cookies while we stood in line outside! Such great service, and their food is outstanding. This place truly makes you feel welcome. Screw the other restaurants that try to make you think that... ""When you're here, you're family!""... F*** you, Olive Garden!!! I love Tom's!!!! There is nothing ""mediocre"" about this place. Might I add, great prices as well! I wish I could come here again..."
9794,28,5,1,1/31/2010,"I recently moved to brooklyn and have been looking for my easy-going, good food, cheap and friendly sunday brunch place since I got here. Tom's is def it! The coolest thing about this place is they feed you while waiting in line!!!!!! and it's gooooood!!! The staff is friendly and its a small homey place with good food. Try the turkey sausage, the fries and staple chipotle sauce are out of this world. It's also really easy to get to, less than a 5 minute walk from the 2,3. Try it, you'll def want to go back again."
9795,28,5,1,1/23/2010,"Pancakes. ˜Piping hot. ˜Flavors galore. ˜Fluffy yet filling. ˜While Tom's is for the most part an old-fashioned greasy spoon, their pancakes are simply delicious. ˜Lemon Ricotta is my absolute fave. ˜If you can brave the line on a cold winter's day, they're sure to fill you with warm goodness."
9796,28,3,1,1/18/2010,A nice local diner that's obviously got some history that extends well before my arrival in the hood but I couldn't get excited about the place. I stood in the rain for 15 minutes and really didn't get anything special. I support other old-school local joints so I don't think I'm being a new yuppie insert. It's a friendly diner with diner food but not worth lining up for especially in the cold or rain.
9797,28,5,1,1/15/2010,"Like previous poster said, this place doesn't really need anymore reviews, but I just wanted to add that I went to Tom's for the first time last week and it definitely lives up to it's name. Too bad it's always so packed. The staff is really friendly though, and they gave us cookies while we waited for our table to be cleared. So sweet."
9798,28,3,1,1/10/2010,"This place doesn't really need any more reviews, but I tend to think it's a bit overrated. If the standard wait were 15-20 minutes on weekends, it would get an extra half star. But we waited about 30 minutes - short compared to the who knows how long of a wait on non-20 degree days when people are wrapped around the block - which is the absolute wait time cutoff that still justifies the food quality. Yes, they have an extensive and interesting menu. Overall, tasty food. But here's why they get 3 stars, on top of the silly wait time: * I'm pretty sure their crabcakes go from the freezer to the toaster oven to your plate. They're pretty mediocre. Considering how much they advertise their crabcake dishes, I'd expect something closer to homemade. * Everything is drowning in grease. Especially the delicious fries (didn't try the home fries). * Service is competent but some of the wait staff make no attempt to hide the fact that they don't want to be there passing out sausage and cookie samples to people in line. Does someone have a gun to your head? Leave the damn attitude at home. * Was not impressed with the pork sausage. It was just meh. If you're just looking for brunch in the neighborhood, head to Teddy's a couple blocks down. Their food is less greasy, their service is better, and you won't have to wait long, if at all. If you're looking for the novelty dishes that Tom's is known for - egg cremes, lemon rickeys, pancakes with the flavored butters, bring something to do while standing in line."
9799,28,4,1,1/9/2010,"I'm new to the neighborhood and Tom's has already become a go-to breakfast/brunch place. I generally go earlier on weekend mornings (around 9am), so I've never had to wait. How do they get their pancakes to be so fluffy and moist, yet not too dense?! I love, love, love their lemon ricotta pancakes, but I also have love for their sweet potato pancakes. Have them with a side of pork sausage. Juicy but not too greasy or salty, and it's oh so good together. I wasn't crazy about their crab cake benedict. The crab cakes were way too bready, but I guess I should've expected that."
9800,28,5,1,1/2/2010,"I love this restaurant! ˜Great food, wonderful staff, fabulous atmosphere, inexpensive. ˜Only it's not open Sundays which is my favorite day for brunch."
9801,28,4,1,1/1/2010,"Best diner I've been to in a while! Banana walnut pancakes were off the hook! Recommend to go early. After 12 pm, line out the door!"
5674,28,4,1,12/23/2009,I can't wait to go back for the lemon ricotta pancakes. DAMN they are good! So fluffy and tasty.
9802,28,4,1,12/22/2009,"Love the pancake selections! ˜Cranberry, Apple walnut, Pumpkin walnut, supreme (mango/bbery/someotherberry), etc etc. ˜Extensive selection for the belgian waffles as well. ˜The waffles were HUGE btw. ˜But I went for the pancake. Seating/space is a bit tight, but real estate can be hard to come by in NY, I suppose. ˜Servers seemed friendly. ˜Very reasonable prices. I doubt I would ever trek out all the way to Brooklyn for a diner, but if I'm in the area around brunch time, fo'sho to Tom's I will go."
9803,28,4,1,12/21/2009,"Its Tuesday and you want breakfast, where do you go? Toms. Tom's stands out above the rest because the staff is so friendly. Once I walked in early morning after a run and they said ""congratulations, you're the first customer today!"" and handed me a complimentary snack as you debated what to eat. Selection-wise... its really just a regular diner. But the food they make is so good. The Mexican omelet and the pancakes are my favorite. If you -have- to go on the weekend there will always be a long line. Don't worry! About every 2 minutes someone comes out with oranges, sausage bits, french fries, cups of coffee, etc. to ease your hunger and warm up your appetite. All in all I'm glad I live a block away from this BK institution. ....doo doo doo doo doo doooooo"
9804,28,2,1,12/15/2009,"The Yelp description for 2 stars is ""Meh. I've experienced better."" ˜That pretty much sums up my review of this place. ˜The the staff are fantastic and the owner, who is the original Tom's son, is great (and I wish I could give them a better review). ˜The decor is kitsch to the max, which is fits perfectly and adds to the experience. ˜They also give you orange slices and other treats as you wait in line. However, each time I've been( and I really want to like this place, but after the fourth trip I can't do it anymore... ) I've been underwhelmed by the quality of the food. ˜The brunch menu contains pretty simple fare, so I'm not expecting the world, just a nice country-style brunch properly executed. ˜The eggs, though, are rubbery and overcooked and the homefries are, frankly, terrible. ˜They're just chunks of potato (cut too big so that they don't cook all the way through) and fried in a skillet until brownish and soggy. ˜They're neither crisp nor flavorful, and sort of mealy. ˜I've also had the corned beef hash, which is also (noticing a theme?) flavorless and undercooked. To be fair, I'm not big on sugary brunch food like waffles and pancakes, which other yelpers seem to love at Tom's but I haven't tried, so if that's your thing, give it a try I guess. ˜However, if you like a heartier brunch, there are a number of other places on Wash Ave that do it better, and don't have an absurdly long wait."
9805,28,4,1,12/14/2009,"This place would get 5 stars if the home fries had more flavor. ˜That said, everything else was fantastic! ˜My western omelette, the standard by which I rate all diners, was hearty and not at all greasy. ˜The coffee was delicious and everyone around us seemed to be enjoying their food as well. ˜I got a taste of the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were nom nom. It was a rainy sunday morning so there was no wait, but I can definitely see how this place can get super packed. ˜The wait staff was great and I appreciated the guy who came around with free cookies, even if they were from a package. I can't wait to go back and try everything else!"
9806,28,5,1,12/13/2009,"Skip the menu and go right to the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Fluffy and creamy and a superb way to start a rainy day in Brooklyn. The rest of the food was great too, and aside from the bacon not being as crisp as I prefer, I'd say it was the perfect breakfast experience. To say the prices are reasonable is an understatement. For under $10 a person you get enough breakfast to last you the day, at a quality that far exceeds the price point. If you don't want to wait, call ahead and ask how the line is."
9807,28,5,1,12/9/2009,"Delicious, clean, bright, comfortable. Yummy breakfast all day! And it's THE Tom's Susanne Vega wrote the awesome song about; that's a plus. The only downside -- no milkshakes. Great Chocolate Egg Creams, though."
9808,28,5,1,12/6/2009,"Yum! The breakfast I've been looking for, found at last. Old school diner with character to spare. It doesn't hurt that Christmas had exploded all over the place when I first visited. Boyfriend found huevos rancheros worthy of cleaning the plate, was so very happy. I myself was pretty blissed out with my crabcakes florentine with its heaps of spinach and crispy crabcakes. The food is very old fashioned-- I wouldn't press the staff for info about where the food comes from or if its frozen-- but the price is right and the atmosphere can't be beat."
9809,28,5,1,11/30/2009,"Had brunch here with my buddies on a busy perfect Sunday afternoon. My friend and I waited for our other friend to arrive for like an hour. ˜I know, what a flake, but no worries, cause the people were great! ˜We were totally shooting the poop with the the staff while chillin at the counter. Not to mention there was the occasional hook up with cookies, sausages, orange wedges, coffee, hand sanitizer.... how freaking awesome is that! What we had was some simple and good ol' breakfast food, which can never go wrong. :D -eggs florentine -bacon omelet -eggs benedict ""Tom, I shall be back!"""
9810,28,5,1,11/30/2009,"Tom's was such a pleasant surprise. My husband and I have been feeling pretty burnt out on the Park Slope brunch scene, so we've been venturing out to the surrounding neighborhoods for in search of some new places. First of all, the wait in line was short and we ended up ordering some of the beef sausage we sampled while waiting. The host/manager was a super-friendly guy. He gave us a few tips on what to order and I was more than pleased with his suggestions. We ordered the Crabcakes Florentine (crabcakes on top of cooked spinach and english muffins, covered with Hollandaise), a side of fries (with deliciously spicy horseradish dipping sauce), a side of corned beef hash, challah bread French toast, and, of course, the beef sausage. Yum, yum, yum. It was a good thing we had another 1.5 miles to walk back home because we every last crumb. If you're looking for some comfort food, a kitschy, old-school BK atmosphere, and friendly service, head to Tom's immediately."
9811,28,5,1,11/25/2009,"I cannot say enough good things about Tom's pancakes, waffles, and omelets. ˜On very rare occasions, you may get an undercooked pancake or egg. ˜But where Tom's really shines is the service. ˜You get treated better here than at many ""starred"" Manhattan restaurants. ˜Also, they make the best egg creams I've had anywhere."
9812,28,5,1,11/22/2009,"Wow...you may have to wait in line for a little while, but they'll bring you cookies. ˜It's worth it. ˜Awesome for brunch on the weekend. ˜The prices are very reasonable and the variety of breakfast foods is insane....from sweet potato pancakes to pumpkin/walnut Belgian waffles.....and the craziest is their AMAZING crabcakes. ˜You wouldn't think crab cakes for brunch, but you'll be glad you did it. ˜Enjoy!"
9813,28,4,1,11/18/2009,"Not to beat a dead horse with how good a brunch place this is...but seriously, it's great. ˜As suggested I went early (for a Sunday) and when I got there at 11:00 it was just starting to get busy. ˜There was a short line but I still got some coffee and a bit of sausage with lemon. ˜So nice! ˜The food was home-y and fantastic, ˜the decor was entertaining and the staff was very nice and helpful. ˜ The overall experience was great - but I definitely suggest getting there by 11:00 because the by the time we left there was line around the corner (although I hear it moves pretty quickly.)"
9814,28,4,1,11/14/2009,"We went on a Sunday for brunch, and my mate was instantly skittish of the line snaking 'round the block. ˜We asked the group in front of us how long they thought the wait might be, and the woman, all wide-eyed, said, ""You've never been here before? ˜You barely have to wait. ˜It's huge inside. It's SO good."" Well, with that endorsement, we stayed on line - and I'm so happy we did. ˜Someone came around to feed us orange slices and strawberries with whipped cream while we waited. ˜And oh yes, that wait was merely 10 minutes! We ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes, eggs, sausage, bacon and the grilled chicken. Everything came out lickety-split and the coffee was served in the normal-sized mugs (not the small diner-sized ones) - and piping hot. Pancakes were by far the best we've ever had! ˜And the bacon for me was cooked to perfection. ˜The only thing a little disappointing was the grilled chicken - a bit tough and dry, but they have this house-made chipotle tartar sauce on the table that they try to push and it somehow saved the chicken in the end. Service was so friendly and efficient. ˜Great bustling vibe - never overwhelming. What a fun neighborhood spot. I would come here every weekend!"
9815,28,5,1,11/5/2009,"When we visited our friend last year, he insisted he take us here for brunch. ˜I'm soooo glad he did. He warned us there would be a wait, and sure enough, there was. ˜We joined the line of people in the windy, chilly weather. ˜But, within a few minutes...some guy was walking down the line with a tray of coffee, cream, and sugar! ˜I've never seen anything like it. ˜A few minutes later, little triangles of french toast appear. ˜A few minutes after that...strawberries and cream. ˜We were inside and seated before the next round made its way down the line. ˜As someone else said, I don't think I've ever felt so...welcome before. ˜That was customer service to the extreme. The food was excellent. ˜Don't remember what everyone else got, but I got a Florentine omelet. ˜ It was cooked perfectly, as were the hash browns. ˜I remember having samples of everyone else's food and loving it just as much. ˜My friend got a side of grits with his, and they were to die for: perfect consistency and flavor. The only (small) downside was that it was a bit cramped in there, which makes it a bit of jigsaw puzzle in winter trying to figure out where to stow all your winter gear. ˜But hey...makes it more cozy, I guess. ˜You definitely can't beat that kind of atmosphere. Right now I'm scheming for a way to visit again just so I can come back here for another brunch."
9816,28,4,1,10/29/2009,"Tom's Restaurant is a fabulous eatery for your diner desires. I recently had the Crabcake Florentine (2 crab cakes, hollandaise sauce, english muffin, spinach and feta, and a choice of home fries or grits) for ten dollars. The portions are huge. The egg creams are wonderful. The decor is a wave of nostalgia from a simpler time and the atmosphere is friendly and family-oriented. Service is great and the complementary lollipops are delicious too."
9817,28,5,1,10/27/2009,"I have to say that this has been one of my favorite diners in Brooklyn to go to. I had brunch here with two friends recently and I didn't expect for the diner to live up to its expectation. First, Free coffee and other goods while waiting on line for the table was a real plus. It made the waiting experience a lot more enjoyable, especially since I could have a hot coffee after coming in from the cold weather. Once we were seated, we got right to ordering and our meal came within a good period time. We all got eggs with various sides and they were all delicious. Then the bill comes, cheap as can be. Overall good American diner food, cheap food, cheap coffee, comforting atmosphere. Worth a visit? At least twice."
9818,28,5,1,10/26/2009,"Having read the enthusiastic reviews of one of my favorite yelpers, Brian H. I was completely dying to come here, so when the good lady Laura E. texted me on a Sunday AM like ""brunch?"" I was all ""hells yeah"" As soon as we walk up and join the slight line a nice older man comes over with a tray of coffees. When he saw we were getting rained on a bit he immediately went inside an procured us an umbrella. Moments later someone else brought us french fries. Then the older man was back with honey, cinnamon toast bites. Then someone else offered us orange slices. Then another person had amazingly fresh strawberries and whipped cream. I mean seriously, it was a non-stop influx of lovely little bites. I didn't mind one bit waiting in line for the maybe 15 minutes we had to so long as the delicious kept coming. I don't think I have ever felt so...customer-served. So, after all this snacking I was amazed I still had any room for food, but I geared up and ordered some pumpkin walnut pancakes (and man! was it hard to choose, everything sounded amazing) anyhow, they quickly arrived and were moist, hot, flavorful, amazing. The only even mildly bad thing I could even think to say is that they clearly try to have fast turnover on the tables and after all this food I was reluctant to move my newly acquired pancake butt. Oh well, back out into the rainy Sunday, but hopefully soon to return. After all I still have to check out that egg cream..."
9819,28,4,1,10/21/2009,"Now open on Sunday! Oh boy! You should go here for brunch with your out-of-town buddies for some classic Brooklyn. However, if your friends are expecting a Sex and the City type brunch, tell them that Carrie's house is on Perry Street and point them toward the subway while you chow down at Tom's and make some new friends. I went on a blustery Sunday and they were so nice to serve us hot coffee, strawberries and cream, orange slices, and bread with honey while we waited outside. Service was a definite win. Like many others, I agree, the food is definitely decent and consistent though not otherwordly. BUT it has some of the most reasonable prices of any establishment in this town. Also, its not trying to be too cool or too hip. Its got a million signs telling you about their abundant specials and cherry lime drinks. It has kitsch all over the place. But not TGIFriday's kitsch, but dollar store christmas garland and fall leave garland kitsch. Awesome."
9820,28,5,1,10/19/2009,"This is the best diner on Earth! The atmosphere in there is so lively and warm. It is always decorated for holidays - it has a fab Halloween decoration now so your kids are sure to love it. Tom and his Mother are always very nice and friendly. The staff is great and the food is awesome. I'm not a huge sausage & eggs eater but their eggs & beef sausage dish is the best. This place is so popular it's always packed. Weekends are very busy, sometimes you have to wait on a long line which goes around the corner, but it's so worth it. Plus Tom distributes hot chocolate & hot coffee to the waiting crowd in the cold winter months :) We love this place!!! Prices: couldn't be better. No cards, cash only."
9821,28,5,1,10/18/2009,"I had brunch today at Tom's and it was definitely worth driving through heavy rain and getting lost on the way from the other side of Brooklyn to get there. As we walked through the door, we were greeted with friendly faces and a host that pumped hand sanitizer on our hands! This must've been the first time I've experienced this and was very surprised at what friendly, attentive service they provided. We did not have to wait at all for seats on a Sunday afternoon (around 2:30pm) and our food came only shortly after we placed our orders! My friend ordered the pastrami with two eggs sunny side up with a side of french fries (probably the crunchiest, crispest french fries I've ever had ever) and white toast. I ordered the eggs florentine with hash browns and wheat toast. We also had an extra order of the blueberry french toast and a lemonade and hazelnut cappuccino to drink. My friend especially loved that they served pastrami as opposed to the typical breakfast meats and he also fell in love with the homemade lemonade! He thought it was an awesome deal for only $2.00. To add on to this, the prices at Tom's are extremely affordable for what you get. The bill for the both of us only came out to $37.00 (tip included). Everything we ordered was extremely yummy and we were so glad we made our way to Tom's for our Sunday brunch adventure. I can't wait to return and try all the other items on the menu :)"
9822,28,5,1,10/17/2009,"Tom's is definitely not the best breakfast I have ever had, so why the 5 stars? By far the best service I have ever encountered in any eating establishment. I took my two out of towners here for a late breakfast because it's within walking distance of my apartment (yet another great reason to live in Bedstuy). The line was scary. I had to be to work in two hours, and I wasn't sure if we would have enough time to wait, eat, and subway it to the West Village. Not only did we fit all that in, but we also had time to go to Chelsea and hang out in Highline Park for awhile, that's how fast they are! The line moves super fast, and your time in line is made better with the snacks they bring around-orange slices, chocolate chip cookies, piping hot sausage-all free. They pour you coffee in line too! We were seated within minutes, checked up on the entire time we dined by various people, including I believe the owner. I felt like I was dining at home, but my mom never waits on me hand and foot like this. And the food? Great and super cheap. I had 2 eggs, grits, toast and sausage for $5.50! My friend declared it his favorite meal while in New York. I wouldn't go that far, but there is a reason they've been voted best breakfast for 2 years in a row!"
9823,28,5,1,10/10/2009,"This has to be one of the best diners in the world. ˜Let's face it, how many places cater to you while you are standing outside in line. ˜They bring you coffee and tea, cookies, sausage, oranges, strawberries and whipped cream...all while waiting in line. ˜Then you get seated and the fun begins. ˜Huevos Rancheros is one of my favorites, gooey with egg, cheese and salsa. ˜The best turkey bacon on the face of the earth. ˜The staff is always friendly and you are waited on immediately. ˜I have never had a bad meal here!! ˜GUS, you rock!"
9824,28,5,1,10/9/2009,"As I was waiting outside in the rain, munching on complimentary chocolate chip cookies, lemony sausage, crispy french fries, and strawberries dipped in whipped cream, a customer exited the restaurant, rubbed her belly, and exclaimed, ""Oh, Jesus. YES."" That's when I knew it was well worth the wait. I was so stuffed by the time I got inside that I could barely hold all my lemon ricotta pancakes. The three butters (lemon, strawberry, and cinnamon) were really tasty, as was the chocolate egg cream. My boyfriend had the harvest pancakes, bacon, and the cherry lime ricky. Thumbs up for all three. Management is really attentive. They checked on us several times and we both got hugs as we left. It made me feel like I was eating at my grandparents' house, where I got hugs and they were always trying to stuff me full of food that I should not be eating. And the prices! It doesn't get any cheaper than this. I wobbled out of there like a Weeble, but I'd go there again in a heartbeat."
9825,28,3,1,10/8/2009,"I plan to revisit Toms, since it has been about a year since my last visit. ˜I will post a more accurate critic soon. ˜Out of fairness, I'll give 3 stars until then."
9826,28,5,1,10/4/2009,"It's Sunday, ya'll. ˜Guess what I just did? ˜Ate a lovely, late brunch at Tom's. ˜You heard right! ˜Tom's is now open on Sundays. ˜We were walking down Washington, and I saw the Christmas lights dimly shining. ˜Could it be? ˜Why yes, yes it could. ˜It was like seeing a fucking unicorn."
9827,28,2,1,10/1/2009,"Why does everyone love this place? It's not even that cute...just cluttered and dusty, which I guess people think is charming. ˜I mean, I love the old soda fountain, and if you're just going to get an old-timey soda and a slice of pie, it's great. ˜But nostalgia only goes so far...you also have to eat the food. The spinach omelette is made with limp frozen spinach, the waffles are dry, and the ""fancy butters"" are dull. ˜The potatoes are remarkably bland, and the cherry-lime rickey is just ok. ˜ They also claim to be the Tom's Diner from the Suzanne Vega song, which they are not."
9828,28,5,1,9/21/2009,"I love these guys. I don't mind the line outside, even in winter, because it makes the meal all the better cause you worked for it. Everyone is friendly and they bring you food to snack on while you're waiting. I got lemon chicken once!! 2 eggs fries and toast is great. The omelettes and burgers are good too. The coffee is hot, the kindly old lady manning the register is darling, and I want to eat there everyday and Sunday (which is impossible because that's the day that Gus tends to his garden and sings in his choir, according to the wall)."
9829,28,5,1,9/20/2009,"I love it here.They are so friendly ,The owner(I think) greets everybody and asks if they are ok.The food comes out fast and fresh.I ordered went to the bathroom came back and my food was there..WOW.The best time to go is weekdays because they aren't open on Sundays and Saturday the line is literally around the corner.I have seen people waiting in the rain on two different occasions.However, my patience to eat doesn't stretch far so I went to Cafe Shane's down the block(which is yummy to).To bad Toms is stealing all their business(oh well).Those lemon ricotta pancakes and cranberry waffles to name a few are so yummy with the different flavored butters they serve.The prices cant be beat to..Love me some Toms!"
9830,28,4,1,9/7/2009,"My boyfriend and I try to make it to Tom's at least once a week. ˜Diner food is a class of food all in its own and at Tom's you get some of the best diner food. ˜I love their breakfasts, especially the banana walnut pancakes, and he loves their lunches, especially the chicken salad sandwich with bacon. ˜The best thing about Tom's, though, is the people who work there. ˜It seems like the long time owner, Gus, has retired but he has left the place in the friendly, competent and generous hands of a new batch of people you want to see every week."
9831,28,4,1,9/7/2009,"Tom's get four stars for overall experience. The food is not the best I have ever had for brunch but it definitely hits the spot. Where they smash the competition is price and service! Where else can you go for a freshly cooked breakfast for 4, all less than $35?McDonalds does not count as an option. Also, only place I have been to where they give you free drinks and food while you wait in line! NICE"
9832,28,4,1,8/26/2009,"I was taken to Tom's by my boyfriend, who wanted to introduce me to what he termed a ""Brooklyn institution."" I can see why, after eating here. He had the salisbury steak platter (meatloaf goodness with gravy and onions on top; mashed potatoes and more gravy, and he opted for steamed spinach as a vegetable side). I had the roast beef sandwich with onion rings. My sandwich arrived with fresh, crunchy milk-based coleslaw, a hunk of cold pickle and was served with our large side of onion rings with horseradish dip. The horseradish dip had a mayonnaise base, and was a perfect accompaniement to the crunchy, breaded onion rings. The roast beef sandwich contained layers of slices of beef with the perfect amount of rareness, fat, and meatiness. I would order a side of gravy next time around, so I could dip that lovely sandwich into the gravy. As it was, the amount of gravy added to the sandwich provided just about the right balance of flavour/soggyness. My boyfriend's salisbury steak platter was a meal-and-a-half. An enormous plate contained the trifecta of meat, potatoes, and vegetable. The meat was probably the same as that used in the meatloaf, and the gravy was the same as on my roast beef sandwich. The gravy tasted hearty without being overly salted, was a golden brown, and tasted fresh. Perfect. The only drawback was the steamed spinach -- the spinach had been steamed to oblivion and was stringy and under-seasoned. I wondered if they would have been better served to have come up with creamed spinach if they were going to boil the vegetable to oblivion. I was warned not to try to get in on Saturdays (they are closed Sundays) and I can see why. Even on a weekday brunch, they were far from empty. By the way, for those frustrated or confused by the Sunday closures, it's because the owners are devout Catholics. We had free and rather delicious cookies while we waited -- mine was a frosted ginger cookie and my boyfriend's was chocolate chip. Would definitely return whenever the diner crave strikes -- and I am now so glad to have found a place outside of New Jersey that, unlike Katz's and other diners, is actually affordable for my budget!"
9833,28,4,1,8/24/2009,"I've died and gone to diner heaven. You Brooklyn peeps are so lucky. Why oh why doesn't Chicago have a diner like this? The reuben I had at Tom's was out of this world. And the fries... don't even get me started. I also tried the cherry lime rickey which was awesome. Milkshake could be improved. Hence the 4 star review. BUT, I loved everything else so much that Tom's is now on my permanent must-do list next time I roll through town."
9834,28,3,1,8/23/2009,"I really wanted to like Tom's. ˜The decor is so cute and cozy. ˜The staff was great-- very welcoming and friendly. ˜They give you free cookies and were really great and playful with my toddler. ˜The prices were decent. ˜But I was expecting some really awesome diner food, and it just wasn't. ˜We've been there for breakfast twice now, and there was just nothing special about our food. ˜Things were fine, a bit bland, and uninspired. ˜So it's definitely worth a trip to the neighborhood diner, but once is probably all you'll need."
9835,28,3,1,8/11/2009,"Its just a diner, except with Tiffany glass on the walls, a few unusual menu items, and a ridiculously long line on the weekends. ˜To answer an earlier review, asking where you can get an egg cream these days? LITERALLY ANY OTHER DINER. Bottom line: decent food and prices, not worth the weekend wait."
9836,28,5,1,8/8/2009,"A diner that's only open for breakfast and lunch, and closed on sundays?! ˜wtf, you might think, losing all that sunday business. ˜and the line out the door, wrapping around the corner and down the block every saturday? ˜wtf, this place is not worth it, you might think. ignorance is not always bliss. best reuben sandwich and fries, and the pancakes are always a pleaser. for those dairy fiends out there, the flavored butters are always a bonus, as are the milkshakes and egg creams. ˜the sausages are ENORMOUS! ˜the eclectic ˜menu also includes several mexican options and crabcakes. what continues to amaze me are the genuine, top-notch, old school neighborhood service, and that the food never takes more than 5 min. ˜no joke, even with the line out the door, you can walk in, order something to take out, and you're walking back out in FIVE MINUTES. ˜how do they do that?!"
9837,28,4,1,7/31/2009,"The pumpkin walnut waffles were off the hook, especially smothered in cinnamon butter. Ooh I want to go back and have some right now! The decor is totally absurd in a charming way I guess. The place is adorned in fake flowers that I'm sure makes it look quite interesting in the winter. On a Saturday around 10 am we didn't have to wait at all and there were still open tables when we left around 11:30. But I noticed the chairs wrapped around the corner outside for the anticipated long line. The service was very good; our waiter checked in just enough and a lady came and offered us cookies. However, this last perk would be at least 100% more enticing if they were homemade cookies. They looked to me suspiciously like Chips-a-Hoy. Yuck. The one thing I found decidedly disappointing was the crab cakes. They were made with artificial crab, way too greasy, and mostly bread. Basically, they googled ""how to screw up crab cakes"" and followed the recipe to the T. Adding insult to injury, the turkey sausage side order was literally one 4 inch sausage! And if you're going to give me only 4 inches, you've got to at least give me two. That's just common courtesy. Luckily I was so thouroughly stuffed and delighted by my waffle that I was barely concerned with the sides in the end."
9838,28,4,1,7/28/2009,"ok, so after reading all the reviews I HAD to try this place. I love pancakes. I love greasy ass diners. I love eating pancakes at greasy ass diners at 3pm on weekday. Because I can. And Tom's was certainly a great place to do that. I ordered the lemon riccotta pancakes, which were brought to me with the seasonal lemon lime butter, which sounds totally gross, but was suprisingly delicious. So delicious that I used the strawberry butter too. There was a ridiculous butter to pancake ratio. I didn't touch the syrup. The pancakes by themselves were not as lemony or riccotta-y as I'd hoped. For some reason I thought there would be some sort of lemon and riccotta topping, so I was let down at first. My spirits were definitely lifted after my first smear of delicious flavored butter. The turkey sausage was......interesting..... tasted good...... but interesting. My favorite turkey sausage in the whole world is from a midwestern chain called Cracker Barrel, and nothing will ever compare. Anyway........ I liked that they gave me a 20oz bottle of diet coke along with a milkshake glass full of ice and a newspaper. Loved the decor. Felt like I was in a very clean flea market. Service was absolutely awesome."
9839,28,2,1,7/21/2009,"I waited in a line around the block for this? ok, I didn't actually wait in the line because I went on a weekday morning, but I have been walking by this place for months on weekend mornings and seeing the wait to get in and hearing the rave reviews from neighbors made me think this was God's greasy spoon. Finally, I got around to trying it, and I didn't order an exciting dish--poached eggs, toast, turkey sausage, and home fries--but if you can't make something this simple not taste like a new shoe, then I can't trust the rest of the menu. (my girlfriend said her spinach and feta omelet was subpar). I will say that the interior alone was almost worth the low cost of the food and that expectation probably played a lot into my disappointment, but all in all, the food was really bland."
9840,28,5,1,7/15/2009,"Considering that I'm a Crown Heights local (and trust me Crown Heights locals still consider Washington Ave. part of Crown Heights and I'll be damned if any broker can convince me that for a 2-3 block stretch between Crown Heights and Park Slope lies a mystical, magical ˜gem known as ""Prospect"" Heights. ˜Get off it.) ˜Anyway...considering that I'm a Crown Heights local I was surprised to never have been to this place in all my years here. ˜My mother actually introduced me to the place last year. ˜As everyone has said the owner is really nice. ˜The orange slices and cookies are great. ˜The ambience is totally funky with the vintagey vibe and the floral disguise outside (you wouldn't even know there was a diner inside). ˜The Lemon Ricotta pancakes are fantastic. ˜As a matter of fact I recommend any style of pancake for the simple fact that they serve it with 3 different flavors of butter. ˜Yum. ˜Yes, the owner closes very early and they are closed on Sundays. ˜No complaints here....just saying...you should make a note of it."
9841,28,4,1,7/14/2009,"you remember that song by suzanne vega in the mid 90s? yeah, that's the place. i tend to sit underneath the signed lyrics sheet, but not by my choice. i take it as an omen. one of the best brunch places around. anytime an out-of-town friend is in, i bring them here. decor + friendly staff + speedy service + delicious dishes = good times. only 2 downfalls: not open on sundays (which is my usual day off) and no bloody marys. but they're open 6 days a week so i really can't complain. they also give you slices of oranges and cookies while you wait! seriously. awesome. ps love the crab cakes benedict."
8084,28,3,1,7/12/2009,"Great cranberry waffle (luv the flavored cream/butter with real fruit chunks, I think it was $8), $3.5 two eggs, homefries and toast, you get it with speed but unorganized and if you order 2 dishes you get like a food attack all at once."
8083,28,4,1,7/10/2009,"I certainly appreciate some green peppers and onion in the home fries, assuming they're just a little crispy, but warm mushy peppers and foamy potatoes, brrr. Love all the flowers around, the air feels specially clean, the overcrowded walls somehow manage to produce some charm, the service is on a planet way above the prices, food comes quick, special shout out to the belgian waffle variety [only the waffles, not to the three plastic containers filled with fatty colored butter in replacement of some real cream or ice cream] beware; blue dressed power abusers have been spotted here, they have a station next block."
9842,28,4,1,7/3/2009,"One of my favorite diners ever. ˜There's usually a line to get in but it moves pretty fast and they bring you treats while you wait. Beef sausage links are incredible, eggs benedict are damn near perfect, and the pancakes are big and fluffly. ˜My favorite is the turkey melt with fries!"
9843,28,5,1,7/2/2009,"I know this might be a little strange because it's a diner, but I'm going to say that this way surely my best breakfast experience I've had, ever. First of all, when you come in, you are greeted with a smile and a lot of friendliness from everyone. The seating there is perfect because you are never really sitting on top of anyone, and that's always a plus. Next, was the free Cinnamon bread that they give right when you sit down. Someone also walks around giving cookies throughout the meal, which were bangin. The Cinnamon butter that they put on the toast is SICK, I mean it was one of the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth. They also give you apricot butter and I think it was cherry butter, mmmmmmm....yummy. I ordered the pastrami and eggs which were PERFECT. The manager came over to me and gave me all sorts of mustard type sauces and stuff to complement the meal, and it really did. My friend had the western omelet and french toast and ate every single bite, which never happens. The service is outstanding, the decor is a little crazy but cute, and the staff makes you feel like you are VIP. The best part is that it's pretty cheap. I will be coming back here many many times. I love this place, and I highly recommend it. There's no way you'll have a bad meal here. Oh yeah, cash only!"
9844,28,4,1,6/28/2009,"Great customer service. While waiting in line, servers will come outside and give samples of the food - fries, cookies, beef sausage, coffee, etc. I highly recommend the french fries and the horseradish dipping sauce. The fries are crisp and flavorful. I also recommend the beef sausage. They put lemon juice on top and it's very yummy"
9845,28,4,1,6/28/2009,"Nom nom nom. This was a wonderful introduction to NYC brunch. I've been wanting to go for awhile, but I didn't really want to spend $15 on an omelet with a $5 side of bacon and $8 cup of orange juice, so in that regard, Tom's was perfect. Boyfriend and I ordered lemon ricotta pancakes, eggs benedict with french fries, bacon, a cup of grits, two egg creams and a glass of milk. All this was only $29! Who says brunch has to break the bank? Tom's is a little tacky, but that's all part of the fun. The many accolades and rave reviews that they have racked up over the years are plastered all over the walls, and fake flowers and multicolored twinkle lights lend a festive air to this bustling diner. It's hard not to fall in love when you walk up to Tom's unmissable storefront and are immediately served strawberry wedges accompanied by a tall sundae glass of whipped cream as you join the end of the queue. The line was not that long, and moved quickly, and we were also offered cups of hot coffee. As we reached the head of the line, we were congratulated by the host, who asked how bad the wait had been. Considering the brunch horror stories that proliferate here on yelp it was extraordinarily brief and pleasant! When we sat down, it became clear why: Tom's is deceptively large, and turns over its tables quickly and efficiently. Everyone is so friendly and helpful, that you can't help smiling even before you get the food, which is damn tasty. The pancakes were fluffy and buttery, zesty and sweet, and perfect with some of Tom's flavored butters and without any yucky ""syrup."" The bacon was crispy and chock full of bacony deliciousness. The grits were yummy if a bit boring (I had never tried them before, but I think I like them). The french fries were of that lovely and hard to find variety with little crumbs on them. Greasy and yum. Boyfriend liked his eggs benedict quite a bit. We both loved our not-too-fizzy egg creams. We were both extremely sated and happy after our meal at Tom's, and spent the next hour soaking in the sun while watching the awesome fountain at the Brooklyn Museum. What a day."
9846,28,5,1,6/20/2009,"This 1990 NYT review sums it up nicely. ˜Love this place. ""Time staggered past, and it became more than one decade since boards had covered too many windows on the avenue. But Tom's continues to serve exquisite chocolate egg creams and cherry-lime rickeys and all the treats, from grits to pies to roast chicken, that make living worthwhile.

9848,28,5,1,6/6/2009,"The wait doesn't matter. As with all the other reviews, the staff is super friendly, the food is great, and it has a great vibe.

9849,28,1,1,5/25/2009,"This is a great sounding brunch place... that isn't open on Sundays!!! Good luck finding that useful piece of information on the door when you arrive on a Sunday for brunch and the place is locked up like a bank. ˜You'll have plenty of company on the sidewalk as everyone else walks up ready for brunch and then wonders why a great sounding brunch place is closed on Sundays. Next time I drive to New York for brunch on a day that isn't a Sunday I'll give Tom's another try - there are some great reviews here, but I'm still befuddled by it not being open on Sundays."
9850,28,5,1,5/8/2009,"We went here one day in the late afternoon right before it closed and the line was still out the door. Luckily, they were kind enough to give us cups of coffee, cookies, sausage while we waited. Frankly, that was enough to make us stick around but we also decided to stay because we had heard such great things about it and the line moved pretty quickly. We were definitely NOT disappointed. All of our meals were great and even the lime ricky was tasty. We have omelettes, the rancheros meals, the grits, bacon and sausage on the side and all of it was pretty good. Definitely worth the wait!"
9851,28,4,1,5/7/2009,"Tom's is awesome. They bring out food while you wait in line - french fries, sausage, cookies, fudge, strawberries and cream... i could go on and on. Anyway, the food is really good diner food, served very quickly. Everyone who works there is friendly. They have flavored butter for pancakes - peach, cinnamon apple, something with walnuts, maybe? The prices are low too, so its very recession friendly!"
9852,28,5,1,5/4/2009,"Hands down, the best breakfast I've ever had. This place is reasonably priced and everyone who works there smiles at you. ˜It's a little disarming...they seem genuinely HAPPY. ˜they give you free coffee while you wait in line and feed you with lots of scrumptious bits.

9856,28,5,1,3/28/2009,"Based on some of the other comments I take it this is not the place from that famous song, but if it's not the place Susan Vega was singing about it should have been! This place has really good food, but it's really all about the service. ˜From the kindly old guy behind the counter, Gus who brought over a pop up book for my son. To the staff that greet you while on the line in front of the place with complimentary coffee, cookies and cinnamon toast, to the waiter we recognized as a PhD student friend of a friend who insisted that egg creams should only come in chocolate and gave us a free one to compare against the vanilla one we ordered. ˜Definetly a great place to go for a brunch. ˜Just be aware that there's only a few tables inside so you'll most likely have a bit of a wait, but even while waiting the service makes it all worth it. Bonus: The food's good too!"
9857,28,5,1,3/19/2009,"We are sitting in Tom's diner (It's in Brooklyn, not Manhattan. This is not the place from that song - Nor the one that was on ""Seinfeld."") Though the booth is kind of tiny We're quite happy with the service We were given free orange slices And some very tasty toast. While we're waiting for our order We are greeted by the owner I don't think his name is Tom, though (Pretty sure that was his father.) Then the waiter brings our pancakes They come with three kinds of butter Mine have lemon and ricotta And some bacon on the side. We're admiring the fake flowers And the retro walls and fixtures We have never eaten pancakes Quite so fluffy or delicious And the flavored butter's awesome I would eat it with a spoon I don't care if it is crowded, I'd come back here anytime."
9858,28,5,1,3/11/2009,"I need to be comforted....frequently. By food. Good thing Tom's is about eight blocks from mi casa. Pancakes that Aunt Jemima can't even compare to, with flavored butters and fresh fruit. Coffee and cookies to keep me occupied while I wait for my food, even though service is always quick. They're speedy and I'm needy - we're a match made in Brooklyn."
9859,28,5,1,3/8/2009,"I love Tom's. My husband loves Tom's. My child loves Tom's. Luckily, this place is a quick 10 minute bus ride from our apartment and we always seem to get there before the line rolls out the door and around the corner. No one seems to care about waiting outside to eat because they waiters bring you coffee, orange slices and cookies! No matter what time of day I am there, i always order breakfast and it always tastes good. The staff is always fabulous and the kiddo always walks out with extra treats and dollar coins. Yea, Tom's!"
9860,28,3,1,3/5/2009,"Qerky Brooklyn luncheonette. Must get and egg cream! Cheap and good diner food. I like going there mostly for the atmosphere, plus if there is a line they give you free coffee and cookies. YUM!"
9861,28,4,1,2/17/2009,"A lot of places in New York have been serving pseudo comfort food, but they dress it up and over intellectualize it until it's either no longer comfort food or the result of 4/20 at the CIA. Tom's is actual comfort food. Tom's makes better pancakes than your mother (or at the very least, mine.) Tom's will, like my mother, force you to eat things you didn't ask for while you're in the middle of eating what you did ask for. The rest of the interior is cheesy, warm and very appropriate. This place gets packed for brunch, so coming during the off hours might be best. One big bonus for me is that they have both cherry lime rickys and egg creams. I usually have to get one of each when I'm here. I'd give it five stars, but in the end it's still a diner. A really good diner."
9862,28,4,1,2/9/2009,"So you've been to Tom's? ˜It's a great experience if you know what you're getting into. ˜The hispanic waiters will bully you into ordering, they will force you to accept random cookies, orange slices, and wet-naps, and the food obviously comes out of some time machine in that your well-done burger will be at your table in under a minute. However, they are really nice guys. ˜Gus, the owner, is one of the nicest guys in the world. ˜If you bring in a child, you get dollar coins, because Gus approves of your having children. The food is solid diner fare, and breakfast is really popular. ˜I like to go on the odd off hour, a monday at 10:30, or a thursday at 2. That way I don't have to wait. ˜The decor is as though they never thought to take existing decorations down when they decorate. ˜Lots of plastic flowers, which I hear may be coming back into style. ˜Tom's, however, ˜is a classic."
9863,28,4,1,2/2/2009,"pseudocynics please desist from coming to this establishment because your edges may unravel here! yes it's corny! i liked it! it felt like home in a strange sort of way. while standing outside in the freezing cold, the meseros came bearing the gift of coffee and incongruous bocas such as sausage and chocolate chip cookies. it reminded me of a foraging expedition in the fridge to find something edible for a surprise visitor. gus was the bouncer and a dapper congenial fellow he is. the fried eggs were fried, the bacon was bacon and the coffee tried hard to be coffee. yes it's corny. so what. i liked it!"
9864,28,5,1,1/25/2009,"I've eaten at Tom's literally dozens of times, though only exclusively for breakfast. Tom's food is good, solid diner fare - the pancakes and omelets are great, and new creations keep popping up as specials. I'm partial to the fishcakes (deep fried and served with a mildly spicy dipping sauce), the pumpkin pancakes and the chili cheese omelet. Oh, and their turkey bacon is absolutely killer - give it a try! The servers are very accommodating, running customers' strollers to a storage space in the back, bringing endless coffee refills and providing service with genuine smiles. Gus and Noni (the owners) are absolute sweethearts. The people are really what makes Tom's Restaurant a gem of the neighborhood. (And for the record: Suzanne Vega wrote ""Tom's Diner"" about the restaurant in Manhattan, despite the signed lyrics hung up on the wall. She's gone on record in the NYT as saying so. I firmly believe that she should visit ""the other Tom's"" and enjoy what we Brooklynites have in our backyard!)"
9865,28,5,1,1/22/2009,"Yummy, yummy, yummy. I was staying in Brooklyn on a recent trip to NY and the family I was staying with suggested I check out this place for breakfast. I am so glad I did!! My mom and I each tried some different pancakes, we had a side of bacon, mom had coffee, and I had hot chocolate.The different flavored butters that you get with your pancakes was something that I have never seen before. They were very good. ˜It was a great breakfast. Everything was good. But as most reviewers say, this is nothing new. Loved it!"
9866,28,2,1,1/8/2009,"Tom's has the best atmosphere of any diner in Brooklyn- but the food is really sub-par, as much as I hate to say it. Get the pancakes.Don't drink the coffee. It's a great early am destination for families on Saturdays- but by 9am it's packed. Closed on Sundays."
9867,28,5,1,1/7/2009,"For all of us 20-somethings figuring out how to make our way in this cruel world, Tom's is a lifesaver. ˜We go every Saturday morning to drink coffee and eat cookies while waiting in line, to open the door and see the plastic flowers and carefully hung Christmas lights, to be greeted with a kiss and a handshake by Gus, the owner, to eat the kind of diner food that sticks with you all day, and to leave feeling a little less alone in the world. ˜I also appreciate that while my table may be full of hipsters, the restaurant attracts people from all walks of life who call Prospect Heights home, from police officers to retirees. ˜As we tell someone new every week as they look forlornly at the line out the door, ""It's worth the wait!"""
9868,28,5,1,1/3/2009,"Tom's Restaurant hardly needs any new reviews. The essentials of this restaurant are well known: the place is crowded, extraordinarily popular, wonderful, and worth the wait. Any day that I have off work I attempt to go have brunch at Tom's Restaurant--it's not really open any other time (not on Sundays, and not for dinner.) They do what they do very well. What I do well is eat. What they do and what I do go together very well. And that's all I have to add about Tom's Restaurant."
9869,28,5,1,1/2/2009,"It's been a while since we ate here, but I remember it being very good, affordable, and the owner was so awesome."
9870,28,5,1,1/2/2009,"In a city characterized by impersonal service and overrun with mediocre diners, Tom's is a beacon of warmth and uncommon attention to detail. ˜Every patron is greeted and waved off personally by the owner, Gus, and in between is served promptly by a friendly staff. ˜The crab cakes and eggs are unbelievable. Sorry to disappoint, but contrary to the implication of the signed lyric sheets pasted around the walls, Suzanne Vega did not write ""Tom's Diner"" about this place, but about the more famous Manhattan ""RESTAURANT."" ˜In her own words (from measureformeasure.blogs.?): ""When I was at Barnard College in Manhattan, I used to go to Tom's Restaurant for coffee, and after I graduated I also ate there before going to work. It was then a cheap, greasy place on 112th and Broadway, and it still is, in spite of its celebrity. (Sorry, but I have never been to the one in Brooklyn, though I hear it's really cute. The real one isn't cute, and isn't atmospheric. It's just plain, which is why I liked it.)"" I don't need Suzanne Vega to agree with me anyway."
9871,28,5,1,12/10/2008,"I ""discovered"" (ha! I use that word lightly because this place isn't really a discovery - it's been here forever!) this place on Yelp months ago and finally made the trek to Tom's last Saturday with my boyfriend. When we got there, the line was stretching around the corner of the building, but it only took us only about 15 minutes to make it inside to get a table. While we were waiting, servers came around with coffee, sausage, and fresh strawberries with whipped cream! That was probably the highlight of my first Tom's experience because it's so unique and friendly and totally makes the wait go by quickly and happily! I had the lemon ricotta pancakes for my brunch with a cherry lime rickey! I was one happy camper. My boyfriend had the crab cakes and he said they were really good, though not really his idea of breakfast food. I could understand that."
9872,28,5,1,11/14/2008,"Friendliest service I've ever seen in a diner. ˜Great atmosphere. ˜If I lived there I'd be there every weekend for brunch. ˜I'm sure many people have spoken eloquently about this place, I just wanted to add my little comments."
9873,28,4,1,11/11/2008,"This is the kind of place I would bring my grandparents to if they visited me. ˜An old school diner feel, egg creams, gaudy decorations. ˜I love it. It's probably the only place I go to where I actually anticipate waiting in line. ˜Coffee, honey drizzled toast, strawberries in whipped cream, orange slices, cookies... all before you even get inside! I always take out of towners here, and they're always impressed. ˜It's not world class cuisine by any means, but it really makes you feel like you've stepped back in time to a diner in the 40s. Worth ordering: the spinach and feta omelet (it might have been the special when we went), huevos rancheros, and any kind of pancake. Next time I go, I will bring a bag to steal the flavored butter."
9874,28,5,1,11/11/2008,"Brunch/breakfast lovers, this place is a MUST. ˜Wow, huge portions, delicious brunch/breakfast food. ˜Pumpkin waffles were deliciously perfect. ˜Crab cakes with eggs, yum. ˜Came here on a rainy day a couple weeks ago and the four of us ordered so much food. Luckily there was no wait on a weekday around 1pm. ˜They even gave us free cookies and fries. ˜The prices are so reasonable, it's crazy. ˜If only there were a Tom's in SF. ˜Everyone who works here is in a super friendly, good mood. Love it!"
9875,28,5,1,11/1/2008,"There's probably little I can say that hasn't been said already -- the classic diner fare is some of the best around with a few signature items like the harvest pancakes (sweet corn and cranberries) and the flavored butters. ˜The crab cakes are tasty and there's more than three types of breakfast meat. ˜The typical line on Saturday mornings is more than tolerable because the staff visits you with trays of coffee, cookies, orange wedges and a recent addition -- sausages doused in lemon juice. ˜The owner, Gus, is a warm, friendly character who treats you like family and always makes sure you have a moist towelette. Tom's is my favorite neighborhood joint without a doubt. ˜Everyone in Brooklyn eats at Tom's -- I even saw Keri Russell (Felicity) there once. ˜My only complaint is that it's not open on Sundays."
8122,28,2,1,10/21/2008,"The food was not so good: eggs, sausages, crabcakes, homefries. The sausages were very a la frozen food isle, the crabcakes were heavy on the cake and light on the crab-they reminded me of the real diner food I really don't want to eat anymore in my life, the homefries (2 servings of them) were cold and tasteless. Ok, this place has a certain old-school charm. The family-run aesthetic however, is long gone. Instead of replacing it with young white girls who need to wash, they have older Latino men: I guess this means neighborhoody in these parts. But it seems more like a front for oh-so-cool hipsters who would rather be served by older Latino men (e.g. often exploited workers that are cool to be around because of their impoverished authenticity) rather than the girls they would like to be or have as their girlfriends who are slumming it for a while before moving on to motherhood or a professional job. One of the hipster boys at the table next to us said it was one of his ""top 5"" meals ever. If so, I think his momma didn't train his mouth right. Oh, I did like their kinda cozy kinda ironic coffee mugs. But, um, not once was I asked if I wanted a top up, warm up, whatever. I had to wave someone down to ask for a refill after he got impatient with me for spending more than 30 seconds looking at the menu....The man across from me complained repeatedly because they didn't give him what he wanted; another man behind me was like: I need silverware (and the waiter was like ""silverware?""). I would not avoid this place, but I wouldn't go there seeking it out either. If you happen to be closeby, like at the Brooklyn museum, then by all means stop by. They are lucky there is a song about this place."
8011,28,4,1,10/7/2008,"4.5 stars... Tom's is phenomenal. They are a NYC institution and rightfully so. ˜The prices here are very reasonable with nothing over priced which is rare enough in the city, and extremely rare with a place as well known as Tom's. The outside of the diner is decorated beautifully. When I went this fall it was decorated with bushes, scare crows, and fall decorations you could only find in a quaint neighborhood restaurant in small town America. Expect lines on a weekend morning 25-45 deep but they have a remedy for that. They have a waiter come out every couple minutes offering things like, coffee, water, cookies, oranges, strawberries, french fries, etc.. to keep you entertained and keep your hunger in check so you don't leave. But if you get here on weekdays or earlier on the weekend like before 9am you probably won't have to deal with a line. ˜ They have all the classic breakfast items done extremely well and some innovative ones you'll never find anywhere else. IThey're well known for their egg cream, which I tried for the first time (the chocolate version) and I thought it tasted enough like chocolate milk (though slightly different) that I would probably just get chocolate milk instead in the future. The innovations are really centered around their dozen or so types of pancakes. From pumpkin walnut, to blueberry danish, to orange and everything in between there is a pancake to turn everyone's world upside down. If that wasn't enough they serve them with cinnamon, lemon, and strawberry butters. I got the orange pancakes with bacon and cinnamon butter and it was unbelievable. The portions here are a little modest but you won't be leaving here hungry and it ends up being just enough. If all those praises weren't enough the people were very nice and the timing was fantastic (I don't think I had to wait more than 15min for my hot fresh and tasty breakfast). The place has been around since the 30s and although I doubt they had as many Mexican employees back then I'm sure the warm service and good food hasn't changed a bit in the past century. Tom's is definitely the best breakfast I've had in NY yet."
7991,28,5,1,9/26/2008,"Every time I feel compelled to update a review, it's usually so I can just give the place more and more and MORE stars. Generally because I'm obsessed. Mm, this is no exception. I went the savory route at Tom's yesterday and had poached eggs with grits, bacon, and toast. Good LORD it was delicious. ˜I'm rethinking my devotion to Egg-- my stormbird nature revolts a little bit every time I go there (but I quiet it down with some carmelized grapefruit), and that doesn't happen at Tom's. ˜Whatever. I can have two breakfast favorites. I can be poly-brunchamous. ˜ I love Tom's."
9876,28,4,1,9/22/2008,"Damn, such a little gem! Fast, fresh, and cheap. Everyone at my table stared in disbelief as our breakfast arrived mere minutes after we placed our order. Not only that, but it was piping hot and oh so delicious -- and served by a super friendly staff. Service is punctual, drink refills are frequent, and the chipotle sauce is as good as they claim. I wish this place was right around the corner from my house, because I'd be there all the time. I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in the neighborhood."
9877,28,3,1,9/12/2008,"This place is pretty good. Coffee is good, pancakes are good, everything else I've had is meh. Stay far FAR away from the huevos rancheros. If you're a huevos rancheros fan, these could make you cry. And not in a good way. An eggs florentine fan I was eating with said the same about the eggs florentine. Prices are really cheap. However, and I hate to say it, nothing here is worth an hour long wait. I like to go early on a weekday morning when I can just walk right in. If anything can get me out of bed a little early it's the promise of pancakes and bottomless pots of coffee. But on Saturdays it's just not worth it."
9878,28,4,1,9/1/2008,"When I first got to Brooklyn, I was lucky enough to move into the building right next door to Tom's. ˜So, for a year, I awoke to the smell of greasy bacon and home fries wafting through my window - YUM. ˜ A typical Saturday at Toms (they're closed on Sundays - so get your ass to church!) usually includes a little bit of a wait in line. ˜But not to worry - Tom's knows what grumpy hungover Brooklynites need first thing on a Saturday morning while they wait for their breakfast - coffee, orange wedges and chocolate chip cookies, all provided while you wait. ˜The cookies are no hoity toity gourmet cookies either - more like some generic version of Chips Ahoy, which IMO, kind of adds to the whole charm. Once you get in (shouldn't take too long - they usually move things along pretty quickly) Gus, Tom's son, who runs the joint, will seat you. ˜Order Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and a Cherry Lime Ricky. ˜Or an egg cream. ˜Delish. ˜The rest - your standard greasy breakfast fare. ˜The walls are covered top to bottom in daily specials, vintage plates, and an array of other kitschy items, so there's no lack of things to look at. ˜Definitely worth the trip if you ever find yourself in the neighborhood."
9879,28,5,1,8/31/2008,"Best (cheap) breakfast! And it's perfect for a hangover =) I suggest going later in the afternoon (breakfast served all day!) to avoid the crowd. But the service is so quick and friendly and they have yet to mess up my order. And, they are great about refilling your coffee cup which is a major plus in my book!"
9880,28,2,1,8/29/2008,"A long line snakes round a tacky exterior. It's hot. Women fan themselves with newspapers, some sit in plastic chairs. The diner door opens and a dark skinned man passes out cold water, chocolate chip cookies, skewered bits of chorizo. The decor is kitschy and inviting. An autographed photo of an astronaut ""The best egg-creams in the universe!"" waits by the door, waits where the lucky wait to be seated. The menu is extensive but contains helpful landmarks to ground your wandering eyes, growling stomach, conversation: sausages, pancakes, eggs, cheese, grits and bacon. Yum. The food is good. The chocolate chip pancakes will surely satisfy whatever carnal urge inspired their presence on a table for two topped with huevos rancheros, cheesy grits, chorizo, egg creams, orange juice, butter, syrup and black coffee. We barely finished a meal that could satisfy an impoverished 3rd world family for several days. What right do we have to splurge in such a casual manner? Where did we learn to forget the food we've wasted like we've forgotten the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki? Woe is us."
9881,28,4,1,8/26/2008,"Always a great dining experience. The food is great, inexpensive, and more than just regular diner fare. They have mango-walnut waffles, chipotle chicken omelettes, and a wide variety of other great foods. The wait might be a little trying for those who are impatient, but it's never too long a wait. On the super generous upside, you can often expect a bevy of snacks and drinks while you wait. There's been coffee, water, sausage, bacon, melon, strawberries & cream, cinnamon toast, and plenty of other great treats. ˜And to make it even better, it's all free! After the not-so-long and none-too-arduous wait you're usually greeted at the front of the queue by Gus, (presumably the owner) who makes sure that you're doing ok thus far and will lead you to your table. He often pops up later on in the meal just to make sure that everything is just right. Which it is. It's decorated sort of like a T.G.I.Friday's might be, with ""a lot of crazy crap on the wall"" but each item that's placed there has been done so with purpose and care. I'd give it five stars but they're not open on Sundays. I've heard that the Suzanne Vega song is about this place, but I've also heard that it's about the Tom's on 112th. (Wiki says it's the 112th, but whatever) oh. Also don't forget the egg creams, they're worth it."
9882,28,4,1,8/26/2008,"I have been eating at Tom's Restaurant for the past 12 years. In that time I have witnessed its popularity grow immensely and the line that wraps around the corner on Saturday mornings. Hands down their best fare is breakfast. I will at times have a turkey burger (which are excellent) but my favorite meal is breakfast anyway. The proprietor Gus is a nice guy who treats and greets his customers like family. Despite what's been said, the interior is authentic be it overly lit with decorations from about 5 or 6 different holidays. Also try the cherrry lime rickeys and shakes. Yummy! The pancakes are excellent. I usually have the crab cakes with grits but will occasionally indulge in their omelets. The prices have gone up a bit but the portions are enormous unless your greedy or a line backer. Yes there is a new yuppie pretention to the neighborhood and it has unfortunately trickled into Tom's. So regulars who know how to eat and go have to watch table whores lounge and stuff their faces and while their screaming kids are annoying everyone around them. You'll love the period music wafting in the background if you can hear over the yuppie drone of important cell phone conversations. Tom's is kid friendly but there are some of us who can only tolerate the added noise level to a minimum. While you wait you are treated to coffee or juice, cookies and pieces of sausage. Who else does that? (Seriously if you know tell me if you know of a place). When friends visit they want to go to Tom's. Why? Because you are treated well and there's fast service. If you live in the 'hood call for delivery. It is oh so fast!"
9883,28,3,1,8/21/2008,"I have been to Tom's a few times. The men in my life absolutely love it. A huge menu, cheap as hell.... I , on the other hand, find it just ok. The history is intriguing. Gus is a doll. The food can be hit or miss. I have had omelettes that were so salty that I couldn't eat them and I've had perfectly satisfying pancakes. That being said, it's a great place for breakfast any day of the week (except Sunday, of course)."
9884,28,4,1,8/18/2008,"Really delicious, relatively cheap food - I can't wait to come back in the fall to have some of the pumpkin waffles. Don't let the wait outside on the weekends scare you off - the fantastic staff comes outside to the line with glasses of cold water in the summer, hot chocolate in the winter, cookies, cinammon toast, strawberries and cream, oranges, coffee and more. Like others have said, the owner treats you as if he's inviting you into his own kitchen. And this is the only breakfast / brunch place I've ever been to that understands and listens when I ask for my bacon ""well done."" Definitely worth a bit of a wait."
9885,28,4,1,8/9/2008,"This place has history (was in 1936?). They have an old phone booth in the back (now used for storage of course). The owner is old timey sweet, and I guess his dad opened the place, and they go way back with the guys who run the hardware across the street. By the way, it's a good hardware store. Oh, and if you want a good nursery, go up to Dean and Washington. But I digress."
9886,28,1,1,8/1/2008,"In working in the decor industry for 8 years, I know a styled interior when I see one. And sometimes they blindside the average person, who mistakes them as the real thing. But this place has been styled by someone hired to make it look vintage-diner-chic. And people buy into the image - that's why droves of hipsters flock to the place, and keep going in my opinion...whatever they did seems to work. Cuz it wasn't always like that. Still, I've lived a far walk's distance from this place since 2003, and have always really really wanted to love it. It has all the qualities of a quaint little neighborhood place: it's quirky, has lots of character such as having a vintage-kitschy decor (inside and out), being open when it wants to be (that mom-and-pop essence), the staff has lots of personality (sometimes abbrasive), they treat you like you matter (the owner, mainly), there's an abundance of kitchy decor like plastic flowers and tacky framed pictures and stuff that looks like it's been there since forever, the photos of famous people (every classic place has to have that), the effort to offer old-tyme classic treats like egg creams, the cash-only policy, and the feeling of a timeless, old-skool, classic enviroment - the kind that can't fathom adjustments to the menu standard dishes. Yes it's a diner. But!....... I'd always hoped it would have a truly old-world grandma's cooking style that brings about that delicious flavor that's hard to find anymore. I have to say that it doesn't have anything close. You're way better off waiting in line at Mike's in Clinton Hill....the hipsters love it there too, but they have good reason to; Mike's simple menu and good food is dun-rite. I've tried a lot of things on the menu at Tom's in hopes of finding that one thing that was especially good. Nothing. Even the breakfast was below average to me - I've tried a few things from the pancakes to the eggs....simple enough....nothing is ever better than a typical greasy spoon, if that. I'm not a picky person, but I am a foodie -- I have my standards. I don't see what the hype is about. I could go to a million more neighborhood places and get something way better. I even had better food at Cafe Shane a few doors down once. (I can't believe I just admitted that, cuz usually their food is terrible, but their blueberry pancakes were good one time). Tom's crabcakes tasted like they were defrosted from a box, then microwaved. Their menu is missing a lot of typical diner fare on it, and they get funny if you ask for something that isn't specifically mentioned like the time they made a big deal and were rude when I asked them a fruit salad for me. Since it's not on the menu, it seemed to baffle them that I would request such a thing to be made even though it's typical....weird for a diner (to me). So are they a diner, or just a styled sham? They ˜even have sub-par salads and sandwiches! C'mon...I grew up in a diner city...I am officially qualified to judge diner food for what it is - I'm fully accepting of its limitations. So I am within my rights to say everything Tom's makes is either just ""ok"", or not so good. I ordered a roast beef dinner once when I was in a holiday-food mood and it was blah blah blah - even for a diner. And they act like they're so superior to other diners, closing at 4 or 5 or whatever everyday, and just because they have plastic pointsettias year-round, and a song in a frame that's supposed to be written about them hanging up..... ˜Well in my opinion, this place is a let down, and I'm not afraid to be the only hater on here, damnit!!"
9887,28,5,1,7/24/2008,"If you have the patience to tolerate the long Prospect Heights hipster/yuppie queue (who undoubtedly love the 'irony' of the place) to get into Tom's, then you will be happily surprised to find the best breakfast diner you could ever ask for. All you really need to know about Tom's is that the owner is a super-kind man, and the workingclass breakfast offerings are superb. Top that off with the fact that this is probably the last place within light years of Park Slope that still knows how to make a real Brooklyn egg cream (cue nasal yuppie voice: ""What's even IN those?""), and you've got a sleepy hangover heaven."
9888,28,5,1,7/18/2008,"BEST. EGGCREAM. IN. THE. CITY. I live on the same block as this place and it takes huge amounts of self control to not go down there and get a chocolate egg cream every single day. That said, go get one. You'll thank me."
9889,28,5,1,6/29/2008,"toms! oh how i heart this place. it is brunch mania! at brunchtime, expect to stand in queue but fear not! the lovely staff will bring you coffee while you wait (oh thank god) and orange slices to tide you over until youre seated. always packed, this cozy old school joint makes me nostalgic for a time i wasnt even alive for. everything just feels old fashioned. the food is great, the portions are large and even when the place is bustling like it does, you never wait long to eat. wonderfulness!"
9890,28,5,1,6/21/2008,"This place is fantastic--delicious breakfast (finally a place that gets my eggs over medium correct) FAST service and freebies. ˜Although the line was really long when we got there after a cup of coffee, french fries in some amazing horseradish sauce, cinnamon toast and strawberries with whipped cream that was brought to us as we waited in line---before you knew it we were seated outside watching my neighborhood walk by, it was a great experience--I think they may have found a regular. And to top it off---after breakfast, even tho the line had long gone they came by with a tasty chocolate chip cookie. Yeaah Tom's-------- BUT they should be open on Sundays :("
9891,28,4,1,6/10/2008,"We came here because I was in search of somewhere that'd feed us breakfast close to 3pm. We ordered brunch and it seriously arrived in like 60 seconds. I may have never gotten freshly cooked food that fast at a restaurant. Both vegetarians and meat eaters left happy, full, and satisfied and without spending much money. This place embodies the *good* aspects of stereotypical American food/diners."
9892,28,4,1,6/4/2008,"This place is an anchor. Its something that feels like it holds the neighborhood together connecting its far past, its recent past, and the threads of its capricious present together. This is one place that is always welcoming, always safe. Sit down, relax, order some eggs and beef sausage - hunker down for awhile sipping coffee and relaxing. Have an egg cream on a hot summer day. Love what it is for this world is better for having it. Tom's was America, still is America, but a kind of America being gradually replaced and updated."

It takes us a while to decide upon what to order, not only because the menus are enormous and everything looks fantastic, but because we're more than a little distracted by the decor. ˜Basically, if you can picture what it would look like if Barbara's Crafts Emporium exploded inside a diner, you've got a pretty good idea of what the inside of Tom's is like. ˜You'll see: Christmas lights fake flowers stained glass fluorescent poster-board cut-outs listing menu items American flags And more!! Our food came in what felt like about 90 seconds. ˜Here is what we ate: Eggs Florentine Spinach & Feta omelet French Fries Grits Bacon Toast Coffee GIANT piece of Red Velvet Cake and after all that, they still came around and gave us cookies! ˜ Total? ˜$30. ˜Ridiculous! ˜We love it! ˜Food was great (PERFECT bacon), coffee was tons better than regular diner coffee, and the people were so friendly I thought I'd died and been reborn in the South. ˜I feel I'll be exercising my powers of persuasion again veeeery soon."
9895,28,5,1,3/4/2008,"They have a new chipotle sauce. Delish. Say hi to Gus and his wife, Nonnie, when you're there. Try the tuna melt. I'm a die hard breakfast fan (harvest pancakes with sweet corn and cranberries are tasty), but recently made the switch to tuna melts and I'm hooked."
9896,28,2,1,2/22/2008,"I don't get the fascination with this place. ˜It isn't that I wasn't satisfied with my pumpkin pancakes--I was! ˜I was also happy for the option to have turkey bacon. Honestly, I really was. ˜What I wasn't happy with was the service. ˜I went on a weekday morning with my roommates..there were only a few people in the place yet we waited 10 minutes before we were even given menus. ˜The glasses looked dirty as did the silverware. ˜We waited an excessively long period of time to get our food, despite not coming during a busy hour, oh, and the fact that they only accept cash? lame. ˜The server wasn't especially memorable either. ˜Not particularly friendly or warm. ˜I wanted to like this place but the fact remains, there are SO many BETTER diners out there."
9897,28,5,1,2/20/2008,"Tom's is the real deal. ˜I love everything about it. ˜Fluffy pancakes, flavored butters, great waffles, amazing challah french toast, juevos rancheros (pretty authentic, mis amigos) plus the friendliest and most efficient service EVER. ˜I still don't know how they manage to get the line moving like that. ˜And who else would ever give you coffee, cookies and oranges while you wait??? It's like going back in time to a different, even more neighborhood-y Brooklyn. ˜I swear one of the first things that popped into my head as I consider leaving this town is that I will miss Tom's..."
9898,28,4,1,2/13/2008,"Aside from every breakfast/brunch I've ever eaten at Tom's being yummy and fulfilling, the hospitality and friendliness of the staff make you feel like you've leaped to a parallel universe where hospitality and kindness rule the land. Sometimes it can be a bit over the top, however, but for whatever reason I never seem to mind. They pull it off so well and influentially. And who else would serve you fresh coffee outside while you waited on the line that wrapped out the door and along the sidewalk? You simply can't find a more friendly staff anywhere on earth. The omeletes and crispy fries rock too! The decor is a bit ecclectic but still maintains a home-style charm (could lose much of the artificial flowery stuff though : ). Looking forward to my next leap to Tom's. If I could fly or if I lived closer, I'd probably eat here more often."
9899,28,5,1,2/13/2008,"This place looks like my grandmothers. Plus, I am in love with the location and the fact that it hasn't been laid siege to by the painfully hip. Everyone there is just looking for some goooood breakfast, man. And that's what matters."
9900,28,4,1,2/9/2008,"After being in NY for a couple weeks I was getting worried that nobody ate breakfast. Today I just happened to walk by Tom's with some friends and we freaked out. The place is awesome. Old, quirky and just real good traditional breakfast. Oh yeah and it's... BREAKFAST ALL DAY!!! Tons of interesting pancakes and waffles. Good eggs and they're not afraid of getting you some greasy bacon. The owner was walking around joking, being really friendly. He brought us cookies, which I guess is a pretty regular thing for him to do. I am coming back here every weekend if I get my way"
9901,28,4,1,1/21/2008,"I went to Tom's Diner for the first time one picturesque autumn morning. Having been briefed on its greatness, I still wasn't quite prepared for the wrap around the block queue I discovered upon arrival. I took it as an indicator that either it really was that great or that it was one of those overly hyped places that somehow evaded detection as being such. Precisely when my brunch mates declared that no line was worth that type of wait, a busboy appeared as if by some Hogwarts spell with a placating platter of sausages. After digging in, we decided that perhaps we were a little hasty in writing the place off and resolved to stay. Moments later, our patience was rewarded with chocolate chip cookies, coffee, and orange juice. Before long, we were seated by the amiable owner who was presumably a member of Tom's family tree. ˜It was like sitting in a next door neighbor's kitchen if one were to be lucky enough to have such friendly neighbors. Walls are covered with relics of the diner's past with black and white photos and news clippings of famous people who have dined there. We barely had to wait for our food to arrive. The various fruit butters were delectable and the portions large. Somehow I managed to consume a sizeable part of my french toast in spite of the pre-brunch snack. These people have obviously been in business for a long time and there is good reason for it."
9902,28,3,1,1/17/2008,This diner's food is just OK. Good service--pleasant place for breakfast.
9903,28,5,1,1/15/2008,"Yummy!!!!!! Is there anything that hasn't been said about this place? I 've never been to a diner that seems to value it's customers so much. I mean, between trays that the staff brings out to you while you wait on the habitually long line for your Saturday morning breakfast and the time you actually get to your seat , you're already full! Thanks Tom for making me a fat ass. Love, Golden pancakes, western omelete,bacon and 5 coffees girl."
9904,28,3,1,12/26/2007,"I give Tom's props for their staff. They seem to have a low turnover rate which makes me think that Gus (the owner) treats them well. The food on the other hand has gone down hill and the prices are running parallel to neighborhood real estate. The music creeps me out as well. I can't help but be reminded of Dan Aykroyd's music in the movie Nothin' But Trouble... It's worth checking out and basking in the glory of Suzanne Vega's inspiration. What the hell was a little white girl doing in the hood long before gentrification anyway? She could have been shot when the song was written, all the more reason to enjoy some Eggs Benedict."
9905,28,3,1,12/25/2007,"when i walk into a restaurant this crowded, i guess i expect an outstanding meal, and that's not what i had at Tom's. ˜the food was solid, but not spectacular -- my friend and i split the cranberry pancakes, which were tasty, but a little overcooked for my pancake preferences, and the eggs benedict (again, tasty, but not the best i've ever had). ˜they do get bonus points for the egg creams, but as much as i've lamented the absence of a really good egg cream, the # of points it can earn is limited. ˜after all, at the end of the day it's just seltzer, milk, and syrup; the ""skill"" is only in using an old-fashioned seltzer bottle. service-wise, i have a couple of comments: 1) yes, they brought us coffee while we waited, and on the one hand that was great, but on the other hand it's not like i haven't seen that in other places. ˜2) our waiter was friendly, but we had to ask twice just to get one refill on our coffee. ˜i have to deduct points for that. honestly, the prices were the only thing that were standout to me: $50 for brunch for 5 people? ˜including multiple sides and beverages? ˜impressive. my conclusion is that Tom's does as well as it does because of location: there are so many people in the neighborhood who, understandably, prefer solid close-by food over food that's perhaps a little better but a 20 minute walk away in park slope. ˜or they feel loyalty to it since it's a local institution, and i can respect that. ˜for me, however, i am closer both geographically and emotionally to the park slope options, so that's where i'll be returning."
9906,28,5,1,12/21/2007,Guilty pleasure.
9907,28,4,1,11/13/2007,"Doo da doo doot doot da doo doot, doot do dooot doota dootoo Tom's Diner is a neighborhood classic just as the Suzanne Vega song implies. My good friend lives just around the corner so it's a popular breakfast spot for me. It's just your average diner food of pancakes, eggs, homefries and all that greasy good-stuff .( I believe they have everything pretty much already prepared so there is never a long wait for your food at all ), but the coziness and familiarity are what make it so popular. ˜Whether you're waiting on line or sitting at your table, waitstaff frequently come by and present you with fresh sliced fruit, cookies, or other little treats. Oh the yummy, homemade flavored butters and jams! Who wouldn't want to spread mango butter on their pancakes? Who? The prices are surprisingly cheap for NYC and 2 people can easily get a full breakfast for about $20 along with a tootsie roll and a lollipop as you leave. Definitely worth the visit even if only for coffee and eggs!"
9908,28,2,1,11/5/2007,Eh. Whatever. Nice decor. Indifferent service.
9909,28,4,1,11/2/2007,"Ahhh corned beef hash the way it's supposed to be. Not like the bowl of oil that my cafeteria serves up every morning. Food was good! I was a little disappointed with the home fries because they were extremely mushy (and I know I can make better than that). But what they lacked in home fries, they made up in home made beef sausages (and a freebie second helping too... shhhh said the host). Be prepared to wait a while. The line was out the door when we arrived (prime brunch time ~11a) but they served us cookies and hot coffee! Now that's service. Not a service you get very often anymore and it's a shame... it really makes a difference. The damage wasn't too bad at ~$12 per person. The reason I'm giving them 4 stars is just cuz I thought the place was a little sloppy on the clean up of the tables. I know they were busy but a wet table is pretty gross. But go for the food! It's totally worth it."
9910,28,5,1,11/1/2007,"Tom's keeps it original. I used to live next door, every time I fly in from LA, my first stop is always Tom's. Service is more authentic and friendlier than you will find anywhere. During the long waits on Saturday, they have a steady stream of complimentary oranges, cookies and coffee flowing to those waiting to get in. Gus is the man and nicest guy you will ever meet. Urban legend has it that the Dodgers would go there after games to enjoy cherry lime rickey's and egg creams. The other urban legend is that people in the neighborhood formed a human chain around the restaurant to protect it from rioting in the 60s. True or not, Tom's is a must visit for good traditional breakfast."
9911,28,4,1,10/9/2007,"I'm not so much a fan of the food as I am of the service. ˜The food is mediocre at best. ˜Two items that do stand out are the chili cheese omelette and the corned beef. ˜ Getting back to the service. ˜It's one of the best examples of how a restaurant should treat its clientele. ˜Gus, the owner is all smiles and greets everyone who walks through the door. ˜Waiters will repeat my order with a smile, if there is something wrong with the order it is rectified quickly with no complaints. ˜The rest of the staff give out orange slices and cookies. Water glasses are constantly filled. The delivery boy is courteous and patient (while I dig through my pockets looking for cash). ˜High end restaurants should have good service like Tom's and can take lessons from them. My only complaint is delivery can take a awhile. Especially on weekends."
9912,28,3,1,9/25/2007,"I got caught up in the hype of everyone's reviews on Yelp and decided I had to try this place. ˜True to form, the line outside was graciously served free coffee, water, (store-bought) cookies, oranges, and even sausage, which added to the overall experience. ˜ The inside was pure kitsch, but the restaurant embraces it, so you have to admire that. ˜After all the wildly glowing reviews on here, I really expected to be ""wowed"" by my brunch, but it was... Mediocre [ducks for cover] Seriously, it was fine, but nothing above what you might get at any other diner for breakfast. ˜Maybe even a Denny's. ˜True, I just got an omelet and didn't try some of the more exotic-sounding items on the menu, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about. ˜When I'm hungover and hungry, I'd rather just pay for my coffee and sit down immediately, rather than waiting in line for 20-30 minutes for very very average food. ˜ *Interesting note, Tom's was actually protected by a human shield of neighbors who linked arms when rioting broke out in the area after Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated."
9913,28,5,1,9/4/2007,"I feel so naughty when I dine at Tom's. My boyfriend and I always each get an egg plate then split the silver dollars.. Special butter to go on top.

Yeap, sometimes I just feel lazy--Bring on the winter time!!!"
9914,28,5,1,7/22/2007,"This place is a throwback to something that I'm not old enough to remember, but somehow the collective cultural memory has made me long for. Best egg creams in New York, bar none. ˜Lemon ricotta pancakes, and all sorts of other flavors. ˜It's the only place I order pancakes, because it's the only place that doesn't taste like wallpaper paste. ˜Plus, they have house flavored butters, like cinnamon or mango or strawberry. ˜And they're real. ˜Oh, I'm drooling. ˜The 1930's kitchen/ soda jerk counter just makes me feel happy, and I miss it when they are forced to seat me in the patio extension. ˜Just not the same. ˜ Yes, the waits are long on a weekend morning. ˜But they come outside offering you free coffee, oranges, and cookies while you wait. ˜How is that a bad thing? ˜I've sat waiting for service in many New York restaurants, and they NEVER offer me a thing but a cold fish eye. ˜Yes, I wish they were open on Sunday too, but it just makes you plan more carefully. ˜And the service is so fast, you think that you got someone else's order. ˜I mean, how do molecules get heated faster in their kitchen than anyone else's? ˜Is it a state secret?

9915,28,4,1,7/18/2007,"I recently came to Tom's after a seven year hiatus. ˜I loved it when I went all those years ago, but my memory kept going Swiss Cheese on me about Tom's being closed on Sundays, and since it's not open evening hours (good for them!) it didn't mesh with working. ˜I'd show up on Sunday, excited that there was no line...yeah, I'm *that* dork. ˜ So, now that I control my maternity-leave daytime schedule (if not my nights), I decided to check it out again before heading over to the Botanic Gardens (I also forgot that the Brooklyn Museum is closed on Tuesdays - Oatmeal for brains with Swiss Cheese on the side). ˜ I hate to say it, I really do. ˜I mean, they were so nice about stowing away the annoyingly large stroller, and they provided a highchair thing for the kid (even though it was pretty dirty; it's time he built up some immunities anyway). ˜There were also wicked friendly and quick with service. ˜ Nevertheless....here goes: ˜The Challah Bread French Toast was SO disappointing!!! ˜Oh dear. ˜It's out. ˜I love CBFT. ˜I love fresh strawberries. ˜I was so very hungry. ˜The FT was skinny and dry, and the fresh strawberries were only kind of fresh. ˜ Here's the good news: ˜My friend had a pumpkin and walnut waffle and she really enjoyed it. ˜The pumpkin was a little subtle for me (of course I ˜tried hers. ˜Please.), but the waffle was a lot bigger than my French Toast. ˜Also, I loved my Cherry Lime Rickey. ˜YUM! ˜ I think I'll have to order pancakes next time I go. ˜I do love Tom's so, and they are wicked nice. ˜Also, I now know that going for lunch around 1:30 is perfect if you go with an annoyingly large stroller. ˜I was surprised they didn't stick us in the side room. ˜There was a guy in there, so it wasn't totally closed. ˜ In the end, I still give them four stars because I'll go back; I'll probably even order the FT again...just to use the butter."
9916,28,4,1,7/18/2007,"I love Tom's, great Brooklyn diner, which called to mind the great Baltimore ˜diners I used to frequent. ˜Really good diner food, and the wait has never seemed long to me because of the super-friendly service and the fact that they serve orange slices, cookies, and coffee to the queue. ˜Only fault is that they are not open on ˜Sundays, but if you saw what Saturday is like, maybe you would want a day off too."
9917,28,3,1,7/17/2007,"I understand the comments about it being the only thing in the immediate area -- and if you live close to it, I can totally see giving it 4-5 stars. But if you're considering a trek to Tom's, I'd encourage you to reconsider. Don't get me wrong -- the food is good. ˜But the 30-45 minute wait for a table, along with the trek to get there, make it pretty hard to be satisfied when all's said and done. ˜Chances are there's a place serving up just as good (or close to it) of food in your area, without the wait and the considerable pilgrimage."
9918,28,5,1,7/11/2007,"I moved to the border of Prospect Heights and Clinton Hill on Monday, and after Igor, Boris, and Sergei (their real names, I'm not being racial) moved my stuff in, I strolled down Washington Avenue to the storied Tom's. ˜It was 95 degrees outside, and when I walked in the AC hit me good and hard. ˜Our dying planet shed a tear , but at least I wasn't sweating through my shirt anymore. ˜ The host/server sat me in the annex to the right of the main dining room. ˜The decor is brilliant. ˜So old fashioned and sincere without being the least bit kitschy. ˜Plastic tablecloths, fake flowers and not a drop of irony. ˜(Am I being inadvertently hipstery by appreciating it --- I can't even tell anymore.) I ordered ˜a chicken salad sandwich and bacon on rye and a cherry lime rickey, and both items were simple and perfect. ˜The chicken salad and the bread were both fresh and the rickey was sweet without being cloying. ˜My bill including tip was $10.

9921,28,5,1,4/16/2007,"LOVE THIS PLACE. I ate here with my roommates on a chilly Saturday morning. ˜We live about a block away, so the convenience of this place is awesome.

9923,28,5,1,2/10/2007,"Who doesn't love Tom's? ˜Really... ˜ This is definitely one of the reasons I miss Brooklyn. The decor is kitschy-retro-fun and the food is stick-to-your-ribs. ˜Go, hurry... get yourself a stack of lemon ricotta pancakes (maybe share them). ˜ Yes, this place can be crowded on a Saturday... so I would recommending stopping by during the week. ˜Such a friendly staff. ˜Good egg creams too!"
9924,28,5,1,2/2/2007,"Tom's rules. When we moved to the neighborhood one year ago, we found this gem of a restaurant and fell in love with it. Not only is the food/service/decor great, but the owner Gus is the friendliest and most overly gracious host you could hope for. Crabcakes are some of the best I have ever tasted. Where else do you find egg creams and lime rickeys? Eating at Tom's is like taking a trip back in time. ˜Members of the Brooklyn Dodgers used to wander over to Tom's for ice cream after the games at Ebbets Field. Whenever we need to know something, like where to get our car fixed and not get ripped off, I ˜can go to Gus and ask him. He always steers me right."
9925,28,4,1,1/30/2007,"this place makes me feel warm and snuggly. while you're waiting on line, they'll bring you goodies to munch on and coffee to sip. yum. i like their cherry lime rickeys. and, its always a destination when i hit up the brooklyn museum. my only gripe is that they're not open on sundays!"
9926,28,5,1,1/27/2007,"My only complaints about Tom's are 1) it's so awesome (and by far the best food place in the area) that there's usually a line out the door, and 2) they never ask what kind of cookie I want! I see those chocolate chip cookies in that bin, why do you always hand me oatmeal, bus boy, what are you implying? It's really rare in Brooklyn to be greeted in the manner of a long lost relative, I don't even get such a warm welcome from my actual family. I wish the owner was my grandfather. I gained even more respect for him when I saw how he dealt with an irrationally angry customer, his smile never left his face and he was so nice without being condescending at all, ˜it was incredible. The menu is extensive and everything is awesome, even the beef burrito my boyfriend got off of the specials menu. My favorite is the breakfast and I was amazed to find that the grits are on par with those in the south. Judging by my experience and the amount of people trying to get in, a bad meal doesn't exist at Tom's. The milkshakes are huge and they actually give you the excess which is really only fair. I hate when you go somewhere and you get a tiny cup and then they put the rest of your milkshake in another tiny cup and leave it in the back. What do they do with that, drink it? throw it away? It's not right. The egg creams (chocolate or vanilla) are the best I've had and I've had a lot of egg creams. They're perfect, but I have to say that I was disappointed with the cherry lime rickey. After hearing so much about it, I was expecting something a little more than something that tasted like cherry cough syrup watered down with seltzer. The service is always excellent, in addition to being friendly, the waitstaff and buspeople always make sure you have everything you need and bring everything in a really timely manner. When you pay at the cash register, they give you a blowpop or a little box of chicklets, something that would normally cost you at least five cents or a quarter at any other diner."
9927,28,4,1,10/22/2006,"Oh, Tom's! It's a staple in my diet! This is a place where breakfast is served all day, ice-cold orange wedges are distributed by the friendly staff for free, and the decor is elaborately changed for every season! The food is your standard (yet delicious) diner fare. If you get pancakes or waffles, you'll also get an assortment of Tom's homemade butters, including a strawberry butter, a lime butter, and a cinnamon butter (my favorite!). The non-breakfast food is great as well. Usually my eyes are bigger than my stomach here as I try to get a milkshake AND a meal, and end up overly stuffed! This place is a great value. I recommend the Cherry-Lime Rickey. And be forewarned that you will leave smelling like ""diner."" The only downside if this place is that it closes at 5 PM, and because it is a family owned place, it goes ""on vacation"" (closes for a week or so) sometimes."
8239,28,4,1,10/17/2006,I like this place. They serve you cookies and oranges while you wait for a seat. Their breakfasts are good and the pancakes are even better. So what if the tables are really close together? Who can say no to an old-fashioned type establishment?

9933,28,5,1,8/30/2005,"Tom's Diner is kind of a neighborhood secret, but I have to share -- it's a beautiful 30s diner filled with fake flowers, twinkling party lights and all kinds of funny ornaments like ceramic hens. ˜Every inch of the two rooms is a burst of color, the staff wear matching outfits and the music is old timey. ˜The pancakes are the thing to go for here; pumpkin walnut, lemon ricotta, mango, sweetcorn & cranberry, and the list goes on. ˜My girlfriend and I usually do eggs and split a short stack. ˜Saturdays there's a line, Sundays they don't even open, so the best time to go is weekdays between 6am & 4pm."
9934,28,5,1,5/10/2005,"Ok, this is one of the very top breakfast places in New York. Why? It serves DELICIOUS, old-school diner-y, big breakfasts--that aren't greasy and heavy, just hearty and delicious. ˜They have great straight-up eggs and bacon, and then fancier things like Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. THe coffee is good and so is the selection. The real reason to go to Tom's, though,is the unbelievable, we've-gone-back-in-time-to-a- 1950's-that-never-even-existed atmosphere. Everyone is exceedingly, genuinely nice, and they do down-home things like bring you coffee and oranges if you are waiting for a table. They just don't make 'em like this any more."
9935,29,1,0,6/14/2013,Tried Muchy's for the first time last weekend..it was absolutely disgusting. The meat was gross and had absolutely flavor. Should have just ordered soft tacos because my hard shells were soggy and falling apart. Deliver was very quick though. Don't waste your money...
9936,29,2,0,4/1/2014,Called this place a total of 4 times around 10/11ish and never received an answer. Very confused about the hours of this place.
9937,29,4,0,1/5/2013,large sandwiches. ˜worth the price.
9938,29,5,0,8/6/2014,The good is great. I love the what time is it sandwich. 2 eggs cheesesteak ˜Taylor Ham sausage cheese. To die for! Literally your arteries will clog!
9939,29,5,0,5/8/2014,My family LOVES this place. Counter people are always nice when I order. I usually have the food delivered. My kids cant get enough of the food. I myself love the mudslide fries and cheesesteak. My kids love the Taylor ham sandwich. ˜Weve tried lots on the menu and the food is always delivered in good time and the food is hot. No complaints. Prices are right on. Very clean establishment. I highly recommend ordering from here. You will not be dissappointed!
9940,29,5,0,5/8/2014,"Everything I ate was excellent. ˜Tacos, subs, salads ect. Yummy food would definitely recommend. Again the food is excellent and I would definitely recommend!"
9941,29,5,0,9/8/2013,"Amazing chili dogs, the best fries this side of the boardwalk, and great prices. For $8 I got a fully loaded hot dog, French fries, soda, and a chocolate milk for my daughter. The fries were perfectly cooked and were overflowing from the container they were served in. ˜The chili dog was amazing, a bit crispy on the ends and full of deliciousness. Everything from the bread to the onions on top was a mark of perfection. Large varied menu and fantastic prices."
9942,29,5,0,8/12/2013,I went into Munchy's in Wayne for the first time yesterday. ˜I ordered the Royal Flush and it was better than I had heard! My girlfriend ordered the grilled chicken wrap and said it was delicious. ˜The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean. ˜When we left the staff asked us how was everything and wished us a good day. ˜I will definately be back! They also deliver so that is very convenient!
9943,29,5,0,6/20/2013,LOVE THIS PLACE....got the royal flush sub ---amazing. great comfort food. quick service. Best to eat in instead of getting delivery..subs get soggy.
9944,29,5,0,2/28/2013,"Munches hit the nail on the head with their,""FAT SANDWICHES""..they are the best around at a low price..if your up early,check out their breakfast too.I pass by every morning and stop in at least twice a week for breakfast.My favorite is the Jokers wild fat sandwich..I'd definitely check out Munchys if you're in the area.they have 2 locations now..Wayne & Little Falls"
9945,29,5,1,10/2/2014,We've order from Munchys numerous times and love it the food is delicious the service is great the cost is reasonable and the food is very fresh I can't get enough of great food from Munchys and the ppl that work there are more then pleasant and polite! This place is a must for and one that's hungry and wants something other then the same old same old or crappy pizza!
9946,29,4,1,6/23/2014,"I order from here often, usually get the dealer's choice subs they're pretty good, and big. The nachos are also good. The mozzarella sticks and curly fries are a must have."
9947,29,4,1,6/15/2014,"I just went to this place for the first time, and the taco I had was absolutely delicious. I ordered two but could only eat one, it was so satisfying and I wanted to savor the flavor. Make no mistake, this is definitely nothing more than a slightly upscale fast-food place, similar to a deli style with a more diverse menu, but the food is really good-- especially if you compare it to other restaurants in its caliber."
9948,29,4,1,11/8/2013,"Visited this location after a good friend recommended it. ˜We have similar taste in food so I was pretty sure I would like it. It is a local Mom/Pop shop; good place to sit and grab a bite with your co-workers or something. ˜Place is clean and nice. Food was AMAZING. Had the Acey Deucey: Chicken fingers, fries, cheese, and gravy on a hero roll. ˜Now, it does not take rocket science to put together a sandwich like that, but it was very good. It wasn't a ""sloppy"" sandwich to eat as everything stayed on the roll. Basically, if you are someone like me who loves (for better or for worse lol) ""junk"" food, this place is great. ˜Good to know I don't have to head down to Rutgers to have a ""fat"" sandwich!"
9949,29,2,1,5/29/2013,"There's nothing like walking into a place and not having a single word spoken to you (Ex; ""How are you""; ""What would you like today""). ˜Not to mention the kid working the front had tatoos all over both arms, hat on backwards, and wasn't friendly at all. ˜Stood there for a solid minute and he didn't even say a word. ˜Not to mention after I ordered my sandwich he proceeded to the front of the building to smoke a cigarette outside with his ""skater"" friends. ˜The sandwich overall was actually quite good, I'd rather tell my order to the cooks in back than the kid working the front! Very classless host. ˜Only reason I gave is 2/5 stars is because the food was actually pretty good. ˜Service/friendliness not so much!"
9950,29,1,1,4/24/2013,YUCK!
9951,29,2,1,3/30/2013,"This was the weirdest dining experience I've had in a long time. I was going to order the ""Royal Flush"" combo, until I found out the cheesesteak, Mozzarella sticks, chicken fingers, French fries and Bacon with sauce all came together,...on the same roll!! But that's not the weirdart. I asked the teenage cashier with glasses, tattoos, and hat on backwards if I could get the mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers placed on the dish, but not on the cheesesteak roll,.. and he said ""Not really"" So that makes NO sense! I was paying the same price, but I would have to take them off myself, after the chicken fingers were smothered in the cheese and sauce??? It's just funny, because I would have saved the kid ""cooking"" a step! I can tell the owner is not very hands on,...the floors were so sticky that pieces of toilet paper were all over the floors in the bathroom area, stuck there for eternity,....or at least until someone decides to mop. I watched the teenage cashier come around and wipe the tables with a dirty dry rag, not moving the salt, pepper, ketchup or napkin holder to do so, and just pushing all the crumbs onto the chairs. He didn't really care to use a spray or disinfectant, or a damp soapy rag, and did not bother to straighten any of the now filthy chairs. I never understand what makes someone gamble on a new business, after seeing a much better concept fail immediately in the exact same location. A shame too, because the cheesesteak and roll was actually quite good. Even if I did have to take the fries off of it myself. So weird...."
8505,29,3,1,3/20/2013,"The menu offers a change of pace but delivers only part way. ˜Fast food place; seating a bit nicer than at McDonald's or Subway. Three big flatscreens. ˜Order at the counter and they will call you when your food is ready. ˜A bit cramped if you are waiting. ˜Counter guys are good, ˜have their act together. I remember a few highlights from the overall menu - several Tex-Mex items, what they call over-stuffed sandwiches, and some interesting sides - like fries with gravy. ˜My friend had a quesadilla which looked real good and he rated A-OK. ˜I went with the ""Godfather"" which is a chicken cutlet with mozz, fries, and gravy on a soft roll. ˜I would not order it again. Not enough chicken, mozz was invisible, fries were as bad as I have had in years. ˜Frozen, re-heated badly. ˜Gravy was a saving grace. ˜My guess is that you need to pick and choose. Worth a try. ˜Somebody let me know if the onion rings are any good. Small place, need to stay away from the door in cold weather."
9952,29,2,1,3/13/2013,"A guy from Office Depot suggested this place for tacos. I went and ordered the taco/enchilada/burrito platter. I haven't had good Mexican food since I came to Wayne, but sometimes these ˜little places have decent tacos. I got my order and came back to the hotel. The taco wasnt hardly seasoned. At that moment I realized I should've gotten some 3 buck chuck, shells and seasoning and make it myself. There was on,y a smidgen of taco sauce on it. The meat was only salted and browned. The enchilada tasted like chicken in a corn meal an cake, not much flavor. The. Cheese sauce was clearly a couple of sliced of cheese, or maybe even...horrors of horrors...cheez whiz. I couldn't finish the burrito. All it was was salted ground beef in a burrito shell with the awful cheese sauce on top. Won't be stopping here again."
9953,29,4,1,2/11/2013,"I'm a bit mixed on this place, and it actually makes me sad that they replaced Johnny and Hanges, which I absolutely adored. I suppose I was alone, since they weren't able to stay in business... Then again, they also didn't deliver, and Munchy's does. Munchy's serves what would be referred to as ""fat sandwiches"", and they are actually fantastic if you're in the mood for something that is going to break your diet. Mozzarella sticks, bacon, french fries, philly cheese steak... All in one sandwich. And this isn't the only combination available! On the negative side, their tacos and burritos leave a lot to be desired. The meat they use has a strange consistency, and taste. Likewise the shells are generally soggy. A lot of their specials for the burritos aren't explained well enough, and you'll end up with something covered in a red gravy sauce when you were expecting a plain burrito. This is the side of their menu that needs huge improvements. Their sandwiches and frenchfries, on the other hand, are great. Also, like I said, they deliver. Which is a nice plus. They aren't, however, on grubhub - And they should be. Same goes for Neil's pizza, located in the same shopping center. Overall I'm a fan, though I do hope they improve some of their dishes over the next couple months. Another funny perk is that they sell t-shirts for 10 dollars. The t-shirts remind me of something you would see a band member wearing in the liner notes of an album cover, very late 80's/early 90's. I almost thought this style of marketing was dead, but Munchy's nailed it."
9954,29,1,1,1/19/2013,I went for lunch. ˜I got the Taco special. ˜It was 3 tacos. The tacos I make at home are better. ˜I don't know if I will go back to try anything else. ˜Cause let's face it if you can't do a good taco. ˜Need I say more?
9955,4401,1,0,2/1/2014,"The worst and more expensive Cuban sandwich I ever had !!! Please avoid going ˜to these joint , tasteless food ."
9956,4401,4,0,1/20/2013,"El Cubanito is a quaint and very good take on classic Cuban food. Originally when I had 1st went to El Cubanito during it's inagural 1st month the food was ok Cuban sandwich was rich in flavor yet missing something, Shake's were good but a little on the thick side (personal preference is a bit in-between), Ropa Vieja and Beans were good but again felt as if it was missing something. Overall did not think i would go back. 4 MONTHS LATER WHAT A DIFFERNCE Food has gone up in quality and service has boiled down to just waiting on eating. Cuban Sandwich delictable in a way i have not tasted since the 1st cuban restaurant in Kearny had closed down almost 8 years ago. Morir Sonando was good not to think not to light correct amount of citrus throughout the duration of the drink. Ropa Vieja with Rice and Beans was a delight because as growing up in a latino household i had thought that it could have been made by my grandmother. Pricing has not changed since opening great deal and price for food and service. OVERALL: If you are in Kearny, NJ this is a restaruant you want to stop by and enjoy whether to sit and eat or order and take home you will enjoy this slice of Cuban Cuisine"
5789,4401,5,0,6/8/2014,Good food i love this ˜restaurant
9957,4401,5,0,8/30/2013,"Very good food, dessert very good, coffee, and service friendly and good. First time here and will definitely come here again."
9958,4401,5,0,5/11/2013,Best Spanish food around
9959,4401,5,0,10/26/2012,the only cuban restaurant in little old kearney :) great food tho i love their empanadas.
9960,4401,5,0,9/28/2012,Me and my friend found this place from Yelp and was very happy we did. ˜The food was authentic and fresh. We were having a tough time figuring out what to order so we ordered everything we could possible fit in our bellies and it was delicious. ˜Would definitely go back!!!!!!!!
9961,4401,5,0,1/8/2012,"This place brought the Cuban Sandwich and Ropa Vieja Sandwich back to life! We have enjoyed the pork rib stew, pulled pork sandwich and more at the location as well as having it delivered. They have never disappointed with the food and service. The ladies are always smiling and treat us like family since the first time we dined here. It's a definite keeper, I look forward to trying the oxtail special, last time we ordered it they were sold out so they must be good! Very low priced as well, what more can you ask for? =]"
9962,4401,1,1,1/4/2015,Papa rellena - hot on outside cold on the inside. ˜Coffee - watery. Guava pastry - stale. Croqueta - mushy. Service - hospitable but sorry wIll not be back.
9963,4401,1,1,12/20/2014,"Visited 12/19/2014 at around 8pm with my wife. We entered, sat down, and checked out the menus while three people in the kitchen area talked to each other. After a few minutes they sent over a young Spanish kid who couldn't speak English, or at least pretended he couldn't. We chose three different things off Saturday's menu choices, each one was apparently not available. We felt very unwelcome so we left to eat Indian food at Kamal Palace down the road instead. Will never come here again. We've eaten here several times before, in the restaurant, takeout, and delivery. Delivery is awful, takeout is ok if you can stand being ignored for several minutes and spoken to in broken English. The food is just ok anyway."
9964,4401,5,1,12/17/2014,When i dont have lunch i go to this place and they have Excellent costumer service they are all very friendly and I love their specials. And I really like their chicken empanadas.
9965,4401,5,1,10/14/2014,Finally! A Cuban restaurant with all the traditional favorites for a normal price. We just moved up north from Miami and have had a hard time finding Cuban food without having to pay an arm and a leg for it. We love El Cubanito and order from here at least twice a week. The food is consistent and the staff is very friendly.
9966,4401,4,1,9/27/2014,I enjoy their food and especially their smoothies. Those are delicious. The staff is also friendly.
9967,4401,5,1,8/31/2014,I brought my family here and I was very impressed from the moment I walked in. The small family owned restaurant was clean and the staff offered great customer service. There beef and chicken empanadas were amazing and we had the shredded beef which was so go good we took another order to go. Great place and we will be back soon.
9968,4401,3,1,8/1/2014,Went here today for the first time. Place was empty nobody there. We ordered cuan sandwiches which where okay. I had better ones and biggers for the price i paid here. The downside is that they had the sandwhiches premade just they heat it and serve it to you. Sandwhich needs more flavor i am giving them another oportunity to see i they can make it better next time.
9969,4401,1,1,6/15/2014,"Oh my God this place is terrible. If Cubans in America want to get rid of Fidel Castro once and for all, send him some of the food from here. Poorly described foods, croquettas that are pre-bought and undercooked. Cuban Sandwich with onions??? WTF??? If you have a friend or relative who is a native of Cuba, or if you are an exiled Cuban yourself do yourself a favor and don't eat here. I'd rather clean their floors with my tongue than risk eating here again. To be fair though, it's not all bad.... Their coca cola is ok!"
9970,4401,3,1,6/6/2014,Very disappointed in the espresso the last couple of times there. I don't know if they switched coffee or just afraid to serve Cuban coffee to white boys but it's like it's watered down. Kinda killed the after lunch espresso and flan thing.
9971,4401,2,1,6/1/2014,"Order from here at least once or twice a month. They are not consistent on the main dishes. Extremely disappointed on my last order(breaded steak) steak was burnt to the point of being cardboard! Went straight into the garbage. My husband called them right away And got a refund as promised but, if I was the owner I would have never let that order go out!!!! This has happened before .. You might get a fabulous meal one time and get ˜the same dish horrible the next.."
9972,4401,5,1,5/27/2014,"Definitely some of the best Cuban food I've had! ˜I LOVE their croquettes, especially the cheese one. Also the Saturday special, ox tail is super delicious! ˜The regular ropa vieja and roast pork are also really yummy!!! ˜The staff is really friendly and we received great service."
9973,4401,3,1,5/3/2014,We had the bacalao. It's nicely seasoned and good comfort food. The pork with onions and mojo is good. The bread is spot on. Pork is tender. The mojo is garlicky with a hint of lemon.
5146,4401,1,1,4/30/2014,Why is there pork in both the black rice and yellow bean rice?! Oh so disappointed. ˜I checked in but I had to check right out and did not get to eat here..I didn't want to eat the white rice. Cubans love pig meat but I don't eat it. Sorry.
9974,4401,1,1,4/29/2014,"I have given this place way too many chances to improve their service. ˜Expect to receive your order really late. ˜If you are really looking for speedy turn around, this is not the place. ˜I received the food cold one time. ˜The reason I even continue to order is because they got it right one time. Sadly, only one time. ˜I also had a bad experience ordering on the phone with a lady who got the entire order wrong. ˜We need better Cuban restaurants in Kearny. ˜This is not the one."
9975,4401,4,1,4/21/2014,I love this place. Its authentic Cuban food and fairly priced.
9976,4401,5,1,4/18/2014,Great service . Good prices . Great food . My fav is the Cuban sandwhich and the ropa vieja.. Yummmmyyy!
9977,4401,2,1,4/6/2014,Food is very mediocre. Empanadas were soggy and the black beans and ropa vieja weren't impressive.
9978,4401,2,1,3/29/2014,"This place is ok. ˜I've been here twice. First time I ordered a Cuban sandwich to go. Took forever for my order. Gave them the benefit of the doubt bc the place had just opened. Went there today for dinner after stopping at Jenifer Studio for some pictures. I ordered ropa vieja with arroz con gandules, red beans, and fried yuca with mojo. Hubby ordered bistec encebollado with black beans and tostones. Our beans never came and all the food and sides came at different times. Ropa vieja was ok. They ran out of tres leche... disappointing. To stones and yuca were very greasy and not that great."
9979,4401,4,1,3/17/2014,"I love when I find a place that feels like home. It's a hole in the wall,but the perfect spot for a quick lunch. The service was great. Personally, it's been hard for me to find a spot with a decent Media Noche (Cuban sandwich with sweet bread) that takes my taste buds back to Miami where I became addicted to these sandwiches. I finally found this spot and the price is right! My friend and I had lunch for under $15! I'll be back next week. Lets see if it's consistent."
9980,4401,4,1,3/7/2014,The beauty of a sales life on the road...You find little gems like this along the way. Authentic and delicious Cuban food. Inexpensive as well! Enjoy!
9981,4401,5,1,11/22/2013,Got to hand it to this place. Tasty affordable food with great service. I feel like my grandma is working the kitchen. ˜ Empanadas are solid and only a buck. Papas rellenas at 1.50. Can't beat this place. ˜No need to go into Newark to get Caribbean cuisine!!
9982,4401,4,1,11/1/2013,"I cant say much about the inside because i ordered here for takeout but driving by it seemed reasonably sized. The prices are very reasonable and the amount of food they give is very filling. I had ordered the shredded beef with white rice, beans, and some tostones. All of it was amazing!! My only dislike was that there was peppers in the shredded beef and i'm slightly allergic :( however, I don't waste food so I picked out what I could and still enjoyed it very much. **I should have thought to ask about the peppers since most Cuban places use a lot of peppers in their dishes - my fault. Over-all, my experience was good and the people on the phone were really friendly. I'm looking to try the Cuban sandwich next or the pepper steak. I would definitely recommend if your local."
9983,4401,3,1,9/23/2013,"Ate here once at the restaurant itself & the food was delicious. However, just placed an order for home delivery & two words: NEVER AGAIN! 45 minute wait they told me on the phone, turned out to be an hour & 20 minutes AND, the food wasn't even hot!!!!!! You want this food, just go there yourself because the delivery service SUCKS!"
9984,4401,3,1,9/8/2013,Came here for lunch a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and we were not impressed. The steak sandwich and the frita cubana were just ok. I haven't tried any of the actual meals nor will I. There's definitely other better Cuban spots out there!
9985,4401,5,1,9/6/2013,So Good! Love this place. Great Non Pretentious down to eart Cafeteria Cuban food!
9986,4401,3,1,8/27/2013,"I'm Cuban and when I go to a place serving Cuban food, I expect authenticity. This place was ok. It looks more like a luncheonette than a restaurant. The Cuban sandwiches didn't taste that fresh which is disappointing. I was also extremely shocked that they don't offer fritas on their menu. Big no no. I was so surprised that I asked the owner about it and he said he never thought on it, but would consider adding them. Fritas are Cuban hamburgers and pretty much a staple for quick lunches or late nights. Overall, the staff is friendly and the place is clean, but the food just didn't do it for me. I could cook the same dishes better at home for less money."
9987,4401,5,1,8/5/2013,"Cheap good authentic Cuban Food. I first found out about this place on Yelp and decided to try for myself. I love the bacalau, pork chops and my personal favorite is Chicken Francaise. You have three options for rice. Either white, yellow, or the special rice that includes beans. The food here really does feel like a home cooked meal."
9988,4401,5,1,7/11/2013,Much better than expected. The juices are simply amazing
9989,4401,5,1,7/7/2013,"Hot holy damn, was that a good Cuban sandwich!!!! Granted, I've never had one before, but El Cubanito's sandwich is the bar against all others will be measured. Moist and not greasy? Check. Slab of hand-pulled pork with falls-apart-easily goodness? Check. Bread hard, hot and crusty on the outside yet pillowy on the inside? Yes! Yes! Yes! Others may call this place divey, but I like to think of it as someone's home kitchen that was opened to the public. Good food, good prices, friendly place."
9990,4401,4,1,6/10/2013,"Cubana magnificent. ˜When I roll into a small divey type of establishment I'm looking for three things quality food great prices and quick service not to mention cleanliness which is a given. ˜ All 3 hit home here. $8 for a massive plate with perfectly cooked ˜rice and bean choice. ˜A pork, beef or chicken selection cooked in sauces along with a soda. Really. How can you go wrong. ˜BYOB BONUS!"
9991,4401,5,1,5/25/2013,"El Cubanito catered a small dinner party at my home. ˜My husband and his siblings were all born in Cuba. ˜We all loved the food! ˜Delicious, fresh, tasty, etc..... No more driving to Union City for Cuban food, El Cubanito delivered right to my house! ˜So happy we found this place! ˜Thank you!"
9992,4401,4,1,4/21/2013,When they first opened the food was on the lower end of quality and the service was very slow. A few months later the food quality is great yet the service is still pretty slow. F you have time to wait thirty minutes or so then this place is a great place to eat. The food tastes GREAT ad the portion sizes are wonderful. Prices are great also. I just wish their Cuban sandwich was just a little bigger. They also delver!!! On a scale d 1-10 I give this place a 7.5 and I am very tough on grading!
9993,4401,3,1,4/12/2013,"Ate here once & the food was honestly great & delicious. However we placed an order for home delivery & the 45 minute wait that we were told on the phone, turned out to be an hour & 20 minutes! AND, the food wasn't even hot!!!!!! You want food from here, just go get it yourself because their delivery SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
9994,4401,3,1,12/21/2012,I don't see anything special after going here. Food was OK for the price but that was it.
9995,4401,4,1,11/27/2012,"So glad I read the reviews and decided to come here for lunch one day. The food is delicious and the staff is always friendly! I've had the shredded beef with yellow rice, maduros, black beans, chicken stew, and the Cuban sandwich. All of them were excellent but the Cuban sandwich was really one of the best I've ever had! The prices here are more than reasonable (the cuban is $5 and the entrees avg around was $8). Definitely will return!!!!"
9996,4401,3,1,11/13/2012,"I was kind of disappointed. I really like Cuban food usually. I walked in, looked at the menu and didn't see much of anything of interest. I decided to order something safe so I just got a pork sandwich. It was alright but there was nothing to it. Just some shredded pork on a pressed roll. There were really no strong distinct flavors. You need to pair pork with something. Vegetables, or like a sauce or something to offset it. There was a little bit of onions but barely anything. It was a little on the dry side too. I don't know, it wasn't bad but it was so bland. Maybe I just need to order something else. I guess I'd go back, the service was fine, and the place was clean and everything. I'd just need to get some recommendations on what to order and if I do that I'll update my review accordingly."
9997,4401,5,1,10/23/2012,"Love the Cuban food, the service ... and the prices!"
9998,4401,5,1,10/21/2012,"Great spot for authentic cuban food. Insanely cheap too (nothing more expensive than 7.95. Great fresh empenadas and ropa vieja was really good. Owners personally talked with us several times to make sure everything was good. Desserts, and the three layer milk cake specifically, are really good and again, cheap (cake $3, flan $1.50) Already making plans to go back."
9999,4401,5,1,10/19/2012,The best Cuban restaurant in Kearny hands down. ˜Loving all these new local places. ˜Fridays they have Bacalao! my Favoriate.
10000,4401,3,1,10/9/2012,"If you're expecting quick food around lunchtime, avoid this place. But if you have time to wait and are in the mood for Cuban, El Cubanito is a good spot. A friend and I were in the mood for empanadas and Stella's was closed. So we went a few blocks north, into the 4-table restaurant and glanced at the paper menu. Thursday special: stewed pork ribs. SOLD! After ordering, we waited at least 30 minutes for our food. The people running the restaurant seemed unorganized and were scrambling around taking phone orders and waiting tables. A customer had walked in to pick up a phone order and waited just as long as I did. I felt bad for the kid. My styrofoam box was piled with food! I opted for the yellow, seasoned rice and black beans on the side. It's all included with the meal. The pork was tender and flavorful and fell right off the bone. The yellow rice was too salty for my taste. I will probably have white rice and then add the black beans next time. I was satisfied with my dish and will most likely go back to try other dishes, on a less busy hour/day. Oh, the ˜$1 beef empanadas were excellent."
7235,4401,4,1,8/5/2012,"Authentic-tasting Cuban food that can be served up very quickly and is extremely affordable. ˜They really know how to interact with their customers and there were friendly faces all around. Daily specials are offered for each day of the week and we ordered their Friday night daily special - tilapia, if memory serves me right - definitely choose the yellow rice because it is packed with flavor. ˜The fish was a tad dry, but well-flavored. ˜Black beans were phenomenal. ˜We also ordered a side of white rice and a side of their maduros. ˜The white rice is the only thing I would say was ""meh,"" of my entire meal. ˜The maduros were fresh and well-prepared, just found the way they were cut to be a bit weird. ˜ Their mango milkshake had too much milk (I hate when you can taste the actual milk instead of the blended combination of chosen flavor and ice-cream-ish taste), but that is just my personal preference."
10001,4401,5,1,7/21/2012,Very good food they make you feel at home
10002,4401,4,1,6/25/2012,"Great local find! I am so happy to finally have a decent Cuban spot near home. We are Cuban and live in a predominantly Italian restaurant zone. Great food, unbelievable prices and they deliver! I hope it lasts. It's a perfect spot for this kind of place. The owner is a really nice guy, he even delivers the food himself! Check this place out for a cheap classic Cuban meal."
10003,4401,5,1,6/22/2012,"Excellent food...prices are low...Everyone is very friendly, I can eat from there everyday..."
10004,4401,5,1,6/16/2012,"I stopped by after smelling the food that employees ordered at a neighboring store. ˜I ordered two empanadas (one cheese and one beef), and a breaded chicken cutlet topped with cooked onions with a side of rice and beans, and a mango shake. ˜All of this for less than $13! ˜The food was very delicious and large portions so I had to ask for a box to take the leftovers home. ˜The staff was very friendly and welcoming. ˜I will definitely be returning!!!"
10005,4401,5,1,6/15/2012,"Discovered this place as I was driving one day. Wow...great authentic fresh Cuban place! ˜Tiny...not fancy at all.... Best for quick meal..or takeout. ˜The service is warm and friendly and the prices are fantastic..... ˜Empanadas..croquetas..maduros....ropa vieja, beans and rice....all delicious.,,,, If you want good food and don't need to impress a date.....go here.....!"
10006,4401,5,1,3/22/2012,"This little whole in the wall is a nice surprise. Where else can you get a really good Cuban sandwich for just $5!?!? I've been here a handful of times for the sandwich, and it is SO good. The pork is tender and the bread is toasted just right. Not so toasty where it cuts your mouth, but toasty enough to get that CRUNCH. All of the food here is reasonably priced and cheaper than any Cuban sit down place in a 5-mile radius. The meat and rice platters are very generous. Last time I had the ropa vieja, it was flavorful and filling, with a side of sweet plaintains, what's not to love? The outside is very quaint, but the food speaks for itself. it's great for take out, since it is very small inside. I usually call in to order and pick it up. So happy to find a place like this so close to home."
10007,4401,4,1,12/27/2011,"Went here the first time after I heard from a friend that the food was good and had some samples at her house. ˜This new little cafe is a beautiful gem among a bunch of valueless stones. ˜Finally, a place in Kearny where the food is both authentic and affordable. ˜So far I have been there twice and both times my experience has been the same, great food, great service, great prices. ˜The owners and employees are very nice, and they serve delicious food. ˜The place itself is small and would benefit from a few changes in the decor department, but you can barely notice it after having a meal. ˜They are also on Facebook which is a great forum to spread the news. ˜Definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for an authentic taste of Cuba in a low key quaint enviroment."
10008,4401,5,1,11/28/2011,"Excellent food, great service. They were so kind and helpful. I got a pork sandwich which was only $5 and tasted great! I tried both types of rice, the darker rice was better in my opinion; also got some type of beef stew which was also excellent, but nothing compared to the grilled plantains. Had some leftover to take home, heat up and eat with vanilla ice cream. Super cheap as well! Definitely recommend it and will be going back for sure."
10009,4401,4,1,11/10/2011,"This little store front puts out some good food. ˜It is the first time I have ever told an owner that they need to raise their prices. ˜Everything is so reasonably priced and I want to see them grow and suceed. ˜They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. ˜The highest priced item on the menu is $8.00. I had a small bowl of Chicken Noodle soup which wasn't very small at all. ˜It was loaded with noodles, a big piece of chicken and some vegatables (canned, but it was sstill pretty good). ˜The broth was very tasty. I wanted a roast pork dinner, but it wasn't on the menu. ˜The waitress said she could make it for me. ˜I got a large portion of an absolutely delicious pork, yellow rice and red beans. ˜I don't usually eat much rice and I rarely eat beans. ˜These were so good, I finished nearly all of it. ˜I had rice pudding for dessert and a coke. ˜The bill came to $10.70. ˜I put on my glasses to be sure they charged me for everything. ˜ A gentleman came out from the back and asked me if I liked the food. ˜I said that everything was just fantastic. ˜He very proudly told me ""I am the cook, I make everything"". I am going back tomorrow with friends for lunch. ˜ The place could use a paint job and the furniture is mismatched, but dang - they have fantastic food."
10010,4401,4,1,11/7/2011,"This is a good place for it's value. I'm giving it a 4 because it's hard when you're starting out a new business and you're putting out good food at a good price, I'd like to see this place develop and grow. I went here during one of those Sunday walks and got their chicken stew which I liked because it was pretty tender and the rice with black beans went well with it. You've got the option of choosing a meal from the menu or from the already cooked food at the counter. The maduros was newly cooked when I was there and was good. I'm planning to come here again and get the bistec. Parking is on the street, but since I walk here, it didn't matter. I'm looking forward to having it stay."
10011,2857,1,0,3/17/2014,"wennt to knock today, when i was asked what i wanted to drink i asked if i could have coffee, i was told ""its a pain the ass to get to....' then the man left came back woth my coffee along with an attitude, later he adress me as ""sir"" being that their restaurant is i the gayborhood i would expect he be sensitive to transgendered females....sorry never again i wont be subject to such ignorance"
10012,2857,1,0,9/23/2011,"My family and I went to Knock for my husbands birthday. We knew nothing about the restaurant before we went but based on the reviews, we figured we would try it. Although the staff was very friendly, they were in my opinion a little put off by my two young children. (When I made the reservation I asked if it was ok to bring them, they enthusiastically said yes.) As soon as we walked in they said they didn't have anything for them to eat but that they would find some chicken fingers and french fries!! Already assuming thats what I feed my children?!(Where they would find them I am not quite sure.) The food was so so, my husband cooks better at home. I ordered the seafood combination and it came sitting in a pool of butter, and they did not even have what my husband wanted to order. Not the worst part. After dessert was nearly finished, a COCKROACH crawled across our table!!!! Like he wanted to join us! Not a single staff member came to apologize to us after we told our waiter, including the waiter. He took our money gave us our receipt as if nothing ever happened. Needless to say we won't be returning and neither will anybody we know!"
10013,2857,1,0,6/20/2011,People only say good things about this place out of loyalty for Bill Woods. Other than that it's the worst place in the gayborhood to eat. I've tried time and time again to swallow my proclivities and I'm dissapointed every time. One of the worst meals I've ever had and the service followed. Stay away.
10014,2857,1,0,11/10/2010,"The bar is always fun. ˜ The food is not! ˜You can go in two nights in a row and order the same dish and you won't recognize it as what you had the night before. ˜Bad food is bad enough but ˜when it's not the same each time it comes out of the kitchen, something is seriously wrong! ˜Inconsistency should be their motto. There is one bright spot - the host Jim. ˜Not only is he handsome, but he is gracious and friendly to everyone. ˜He is Knock!! ˜He makes Brunch fun. ˜Let's face it, anyone can fry an egg but when you're having fun and are made to feel special that makes eating cold food okay."
10015,2857,2,0,8/5/2014,"I really like this restaurant...the food is always good to above average. Atmosphere is really nice. Unfortunately some of the bartenders care more about who's texting their phones than keeping customers drinks full. It's not all of them but quit a few. I will continue to go there, I'll just order my drinks when it's good for the bartender...not when it's good for me."
10016,2857,2,0,3/26/2012,"I am getting older now (only 46) but going into the city is not as fun as it used to be. I am so tired of the snotty bartenders and this place was no exception. We get it, you're young and adorable, but you also work for tips! We were there Saturday night 3/24 and had the rudest bartender in a long time. He spoke not one word to us nor made eye contact. You have to be a regular at these places to be treated nice. Philly gayborhood bars DO NOT LIKE OUTSIDERS. This is not my opinion alone, my friends from NYC and DC feel the same way. We won't be going back."
10017,2857,2,0,4/11/2009,"I went with a couple of friends for lunch there today on a visit from NY. ˜The waiter was nice, but not helpful. ˜He recommended the calamari and the pollack and chips. ˜Evidently, they fried everything in water. ˜The calamari was rubbery and the coating was mushy. ˜The fish filets were also mushy, the ""chips"" were real chips (no fries? REALLY?), and the salad was soggy. ˜To be fair, I should say that both of my friends had the salmon BLT sandwich and said they liked their meals. ˜Maybe I caught them on a bad day."
10018,2857,3,0,1/26/2014,nice interior nice option for a laid back type of crowd very friendly staff
10019,2857,3,0,5/3/2010,"So I have been to knock many time and I have enjoyed myself each and every time. ˜This past Sunday my boyfriend and I gather all our friends for a brunch before the equality forum. ˜There was 13 of us, and being in the restaurant business I know about big parties and the trouble they some times can be. ˜I will also mention that more that 80% of our party are also in the the restaurant biz. ˜Of course getting all 13 people together on time is an impossible feat. ˜We made the reso for 11:30 and knew that people would be late. ˜My boyfriend and I showed up at 11:50, yes we were late and felt very bad for being late and understood if we had to wait long for our table. ˜When we arrived 6 out of the 13 of our friends were at the bar. ˜My boyfriend went to the host, Jim, to tell him that we had half the party and that we were very sorry for being late. ˜Jim rolled his eyes at my boyfriend and said, ""Well I have angry tables that are complaining about the out door tables."" ˜My boyfriend told him that we could sit inside if people wanted the outdoor tables. ˜Jim, in a bitchy tone, said ""well i don't know what to tell you!"" ˜We took the outdoor tables that they reserved for us and got everyone out there. ˜Jim did not bring us any menus and someone in our party went inside and got the menus for everyone. After that though we all had the greatest time. ˜Terry our waiter was everything we could hope for. ˜He was fun and delightful and was on top of everything we asked for. ˜The food was perfection. ˜Everyone at the table was licking their plates by the end. ˜ I would say to knock to keep doing what your doing...but please give your host a lesson in kindness!"
10020,2857,4,0,10/18/2014,Food delivered quick and everything is prepared from scratch. They have a Sunday brunch and a prime rib special Sunday ˜nights. Happy hour is from 5 to 7 daily.
10021,2857,4,0,11/27/2012,Outstanding culinary and service. ˜I will be back!
10022,2857,4,0,4/29/2012,"I went there for the first time for Dining Out for Life, 2012 and really liked it. ˜Great menus. ˜ The fig and goat cheese flatbread was the most commonly ordered item in our group. ˜ Lovely atmosphere and very welcoming to everyone---including a bunch of straight girls :) ˜ ˜I thought the prices were OK and the service was very good, very friendly. ˜ ˜It was a little loud but it is a bar and it was Dining Out for Life night which may have accounted for the extra crowd."
10023,2857,4,0,11/10/2009,Friendly bartenders who really know how to shake up a top-shelf cocktail. Also a great place for conversation and sitting at outdoor tables in-season.
10024,2857,5,0,1/17/2012,"Saturday 1/14/12 six couples went to see Jersey Boys and after the show we went to Knock for dinner. This upscale bar and restaurant was voted by our 12 person group as a ""top of the chart"" restaurant to eat and drink in Philadelphia. Our waiter Rick was very professional and funny. He anticipated our needs before having to ask for anything. The variety of food, quality of food, portion size and presentation was outstanding; 12 meals, no complaints and high praise. Cleanliness was also noted at this establishment. The drinks were generous at the bar as well as while dining. We can't say enough about this ""Gem"" in Philly. My wife and I will return as well as the other couples. You will be just as pleased if you decide to go. Enjoy."
10025,2857,5,0,3/29/2011,"Wonderful food, drinks and people. ˜ ˜We stop by every time we are in Philly"
10026,2857,5,0,10/20/2010,"After almost 2 years I went back to Knock last night 10/19/2010 around 7 pm with a friend. I could see the diference that time makes on a place. The waiter was funny without crossing the line, allowed us time to talk and order. The timeing on the food serving was perfect, enough for you to enjoy not only the food but the conversation, the food was great, good taste, hot and the salmon was exquisite. Is one of the best experiences I had in a restaurant in years."
10027,2857,5,0,2/1/2010,Gourgeous staff! tastey dinner great location the gold club for gay men
10028,2857,4,1,1/10/2015,"Stumbled into this restaurant with my family while strolling the streets on a nice evening. ˜Very friendly, very professional, very good service and we all have a great meal."
10029,2857,5,1,1/4/2015,Went for Sunday brunch. ˜My server Jesse was helpful and attentive without being overbearing. ˜Got crab cake with spinach and fresh fruit. ˜Jesse warned that the crab cake was small. ˜I'm not a fan of oversized portions and found it to be the exact right size. ˜The fruit had been cut that morning. ˜The bloody mary is the only drink you'll need because it's strong. ˜I'll be back next week.
10030,2857,4,1,10/27/2014,"I like this place, and I recommend it. It has gradually improved over the years - yes, I've been patronizing Knock since it first opened - and the food is quite good. The salads, entrees and desserts are excellent in fact. I'm sure some of the other reviewers might have come in on an off night, but I will assure you that the ""regulars"" are devoted to this place and it's very popular. The decor is attractive and upscale. In the warmer months you can sit outside, cafe style. Of all the gay bars in Philly, Knock has the best cocktails of all. The bartenders are experts and you don't have to worry about ordering a Sidecar, a Sazerac, a Mudslide, or a Scarlett O'Hara ... they are masters of alcoholic beverages, the drinks are strong, not watered down."
10031,2857,1,1,10/26/2014,"Knock sponsored a charity event for my church and I thank Bill Wood for his kindness. But the staff failed him. We arrived at 11:30AM sat down for brunch and given a glass of water. We sat for a hour and a half waiting for our food that finally came cold. No coffee was offered until after we ate. I am grateful for Bill taking the time and the cost of the food but sitting for a hour and a half with just a glass of water, then eating cold food, well all I can say is that I won't be back to this place anytime soon."
10032,2857,1,1,10/26/2014,"Why come here when there are so many other dinner spots that offer better food, service and atmosphere? Tonight was my last attempt to enjoy a place that lacks in every category."
10033,2857,2,1,9/30/2014,"Nice spot for a drink, but very disappointing kitchen. The strip steak, mussels, Caesar salad, and flat bread were all disappointing."
10034,2857,5,1,8/16/2014,"Always a stop I make after bar hopping for delicious food. James is my favorite server here regardless of how long I haven't been around he always remembers me! The atmosphere is cozy and relaxing. They sometimes even have someone playing the piano. My favorites here is the fried calamari , the jumbalaya, ˜the sunday prime rib, the sliders annddd gah almost everything! Oh and the knock burger is great. The food is good and the drinks are strong! This place is great."
10035,2857,5,1,8/12/2014,"It's Sunday morning and your body is going through withdrawal from the lack of alcohol in the past 6 hours. Most people would call this a hangover, but I call it a sign, a sign that you need to get to Knock and have their famous Knock-out mimosa. Like a good workout regimen, day drinking isn't going to get you anywhere unless you push yourself. This mimosa comes with an added shot of orange vodka, which makes the already beautiful waiters and bar tenders look even better. Who knows, maybe this liquid courage will even push you to find that Sunday afternoon cuddle buddy we all are looking for. Just don't take mine. Pro-tip: sit outside for extra good eye candy, and to work on your tan."
10036,2857,3,1,8/4/2014,"They're trying... Larry, the new manager, is really trying to get this place into shape. ˜BUT, some of the snobby bartenders really should be replaced. ˜I still haven't returned to the restaurant after some pretty awful experiences. The waiters are very nice - but the food doesn't match. ˜ I'll wait until the fall - by then Larry should have been able to make some great changes. ˜Only a drink on occasion for me at present."
10037,2857,4,1,6/14/2014,"Five of us went to Knock last night, and had a blast. We decided to share dishes so we tried many of their specialties, and they were all terrific. Woody, the owner, came and sat with us, so we got to know the history of the place as well. While more a gay restaurant, it welcomes everyone, and I highly recommend it."
10038,2857,5,1,6/13/2014,"OMG to be far away from home and to find THE place that made us feel at home and welcomed. ˜Generous cocktails , fabulous appetizers. ... ˜dinner still to come."
10039,2857,5,1,6/10/2014,I have eaten at Knock twice both times the food was good and the service great. ˜I like the atmosphere of the place. ˜We had dinner and then returned for brunch the following week. ˜The bar area is nice if you want to have a drink and the restaurant part is ˜nicely laid out and the menu was varied with more American fare. ˜Brunch had your standard brunch items all served in a timely matter. ˜Staff is friendly and knowledgeable and it seems to have a lot of regulars.
10040,2857,4,1,5/10/2014,"Came here once a few years ago and now again for my current work conference. ˜Much more down-to-earth and relatively quiet compared to the other bars in the area, older crowd, and friendly bartenders, not crowded at all on a Sunday but pretty busy on Saturday. ˜Had dinner here on the previous visit and it was crowded but fun with decent food. ˜ Definitely recommend for the older and more mature crowd with an avoidance of the trashier options in the hood."
10041,2857,4,1,3/30/2014,"Being an out of towner, I was quite pleased with the atmosphere and the drinks. If I had to pick something bad I'd say the service could be a little better. Overall though it's a great place for a drink and meeting up with friends."
6707,2857,5,1,2/20/2014,Great places for dinner and drinks. The short ribs are fantastic and so is the Caesar salad.
10042,2857,5,1,1/30/2014,A great place for Friday after-work drinks and dinner. ˜One of the best in the City!
10043,2857,3,1,1/8/2014,"So, this place is is much less ""clubby"" than any of the other gay spots in the city. It's more like an upscale piano bar (I think they do actually do live show tunes on piano some nights), with a dining area. I would like to try to eat here, but I never have because they have NOTHING vegan on the menu. So, I really only come here for the drinks, which is why I stopped at 3-stars."
10044,2857,4,1,12/14/2013,"I went to Knock last night with a friend and it was a nice cozy bar/restaurant. ˜Our waiter, who I believe was the owner was extremely helpful. ˜We ordered two strong martinis and some appetizers. ˜The southwestern eggrolls were delicious! Almost better than the ones at Chili's. ˜The avocado ranch dressing was flavorful as well. In the back, they had someone playing Christmas carols on the piano. ˜It put you in the holiday mood. ˜I would definitely come back!"
10045,2857,4,1,12/11/2013,"Came here with a group of colleagues. Nice selection of wine, beer, and specialty cocktails. ˜I had the steak medium rare. It was cooked exactly the way I liked and well seasoned. I would come back next time I'm in town."
10046,2857,4,1,11/10/2013,Chill bar in Center City! Definitely worth stopping by for a drink or two. Food is yummy as well...
10047,2857,5,1,10/15/2013,"Best fresh food, excellent cocktails. I can truly relax,laugh and be myself here"
10048,2857,4,1,10/12/2013,Scallops are really nice. The veggies are also very good. The waiter was relaxed and funny. Very nice experience.
10049,2857,2,1,9/28/2013,"I was there last Saturday early evening. Sat outside. I ordered the southwest egg rolls. My significant other ordered the wings. The service was good. The staff was nice. The food we ordered was very good too. Only one problem.... Three hours later I had bad stomach pains and threw up. That was the only food I had that day. And none of the other three people I spent the weekend with in close quarters got sick. Based on the facts, I suspect that either the food handler had dirty hands or the southwest egg rolls were bad."
10050,2857,1,1,9/22/2013,The atmosphere is nice and it is quite overall. I had a flatbread cheesesteak ˜pizza that was honestly subpar. The bartender was more interested in chatting with his friends than serving us. The cleanliness could be improved in the bar and dining area. I would not recommend this place at all unless you enjoy a bunch of old prissy men sitting around.
10051,2857,5,1,9/15/2013,LOVE LOVE LOVE IT HERE!!! That's all. No big lines or 45 minute drink orders. Best food and great atmosphere. Perfect for dinner and some drinks and great conversation. Every time we go here we make new friends.
10052,2857,4,1,8/21/2013,"One of my favorite gay bar in the city. Great place for happy hour, lunch, brunch and dinner. The staff are wonderful and the drinks are strong. A great meeting place to get a cocktail or two before heading to the other great bars/clubs in the city."
10053,2857,3,1,7/5/2013,"7/4 was my second trip to Knock, excellent drinks, small plates and staff. ˜I had one minor issue. ˜I ordered a chocolate torte, the waiter came back and apologized and said that the restaurant was out and that he would replace with another desert on the house. ˜The person I was with asked for a peanut butter cake and said no need to comp it. ˜Just people he said ""no need to comp"" does NOT mean that he should not have comped it. ˜He he comped it I would have added the price of the desert to the tip. ˜If a waiter says he is going to do something like this they should just do it, its the right time to ignore the customer. Best, John"
5095,2857,2,1,6/13/2013,"This place is mediocre. The Grilled Steak, Onions and Bleu Cheese flatbread was oily. Not a very large portion. And it was almost cold. The cheeseburger was the same way. The fries were cold and limp. Wasn't worth the price! The waiter was not the best either. Not very attentive and not very friendly. Maybe a good place to get drinks with friends, but that's it."
7318,2857,3,1,5/19/2013,"Not being gay myself but having many gay friends, I have seen my share of gay bars and know the scene in Philly pretty well. Pluses of Knock: - Not at all divy or seedy - Knock is clean, bar is well stocked and the clientele is definitely upscale - Not overbearing - I've been in gay bars before where you can't order a drink without getting picked up. ˜This isn't the case here, although if you are looking for a quick hook-up, that's pretty easy here as well. - Pleasant staff - nice guys (and they are all guys, in keeping with the theme here) who will joke with you and pay attention to detail - Strong drinks - not shy about pouring the booze Minuses: - The food is definitely mediocre, at best. ˜While it isn't that pricey really and they clearly attempt to make it a little more upscale, the kitchen execution is pretty lousy. ˜Asked for a burger medium, got it beyond well done and an hour after I ordered it. ˜Calamari was rubber. - Drink prices are high, but welcome to Philly and the Gayborhood Worth a trip by, but walk up the street to Garces Trading Company or Morimoto to eat."

Definitely a MUST!"
10057,2857,1,1,3/24/2013,"Was there on a Friday evening and had to wait a long time to get a drink at the crowded bar. Was pleased to see that the restaurant was so inviting and well-appointed (white table cloths, etc.). Ordered the 'special' fish fry and it was awful: much greasy batter and almost no fish. ˜The waiter's service could be described as ambivalent at best. I've gotten less attitude from homophobic counter servers in hick town diners. ˜ With so many great restaurants in Philly, Knock is really not worth the patronage of the gay community or anyone else. My sincere regrets to the family with children who were poorly treated at this place."
10058,2857,4,1,1/14/2013,"Lezbehonest, this is a gay male bar but gayelle's are just as welcome. Every time I have come in for some good stiff drinks, the staff and patrons have been more than hospitable. And I really love that. The crowd mostly consists of older men. It gets very packed on the weekends but there are plenty bar seats and tables near the TV's. In the warmer weather I'd imagine the patio area is really fun. I love this bar. It's a good time and everyone will make small talk with you including the bartenders."
10059,2857,4,1,10/21/2012,"I had tickets to the Philadelphia Orchestra on 10/20/12. Since Knock is only 4-5 blocks from Verizon Hall, I decided to try Yelp. This was my first time to visit Knock, and I could not have been more pleased. First, the food was quite good (all -- the entree, the sides, and the dessert), the service was consistently attentive without suffocating, and the atmosphere was pleasant. The best rating I can give is to say that I will definitely return."
10060,2857,4,1,8/20/2012,"Oh my gosh...you're so good. ˜You dance just like Nancy Sinatra! You know it's going to be a fun time when a bartender is doing a little go-go dancing while cleaning glasses as ""Wipeout"" by the Surfaris plays. ˜ You know it's going to be even more fun when a patron at the bar offers the above quoted compliment to said bartender. ˜However, the bartender was about 25 years old and and no idea who Nancy Sinatra was, so he went back to washing his glasses. Stopped in here for a quick dinner and drink and was very pleased. ˜Allagash White on tap is never bad. ˜Started with an arugula salad with toasted cashews and Manchego Cheese, which was gigantic but also delicious. ˜That was followed by the small crabcake, served over spinach, which was delightful. I liked the bartenders, the food was good, prices were reasonable and when they play Lesley Gore on the sound system and you hear someone compared to Nancy Sinatra, you simply can't rate this below four stars."
6914,2857,2,1,8/14/2012,"This place is like two different restaurants sometimes. Service is lousy 80 percenty of the time. We are in here every Sunday as this is where the group likes to go. ˜Some of the food can be good and other times it's of a poor nature. I think maybe they have two different lead cooks/chefs? I ordered a stuffed burger last week, it was on the special menu and it came out over done with a burnt roll. ˜(second week in a row I got a burnt roll) I sent it back and it came out rare with parts that were raw. I didn't want to send it back again because it would seem I was being too picky and someone else was paying the check, so okay I let it go. I have always been a fan of the atmosphere and also a year or so ago I had some fantastic lamb chop, so I put this review right in the middle. IF YOU DON'T LIKE OVER DONE OR RAW MEAT DON'T COME."

10063,2857,4,1,6/4/2012,"I have a love hate relationship with knock. On a good night, it's a fun crowd, good food and a good mood. Although, sometimes depending on whether or not they're hosting private parties or if there are cliques scattered about, you may or may not get acknowledged or served. I prefer the upscale feel of the place but a burger could put you in the poor house. Overall I will give it a good rating because I do enjoy spending my time there.."
10064,2857,4,1,3/9/2012,"I've given up on nearly every damn gay bar in this city - but Knock is the one exception. I have never eaten food here, so my rating only applies to the bar, which in my opinion is awesome if you like strong, large drinks for a good price, oh, and you like older gay guys. I am a not young/not old ˜lesbian. So, I am quite often the only female in the bar, which is fine by me. The bartenders are super sweet, the martinis come in martini glasses from IKEA - which if you have seen these things - you know are enormous. Two drinks at Knock is like having 4-5 at any other establishment. It's a total bargain. The bar is ""classy"" looking. The bathrooms are almost always totally clean - and the sinks glow red! Least favorite thing about Knock: very crowded on any given night past 6pm and the bar tables are ""reserved"" LAME. It should be first come first serve. But this is a very minor complaint, and having to stand hasn't stopped me from frequenting this watering hole many times."
10065,2857,4,1,2/26/2012,"Okay, let's be clear. This place looks kind of classy, but it's not. Which is totally fine by me. The clientele can be a bit...bleak, but if you go with friends and enjoy a few of the cheap, SUPER STRONG drinks, it can be quite a good time. Go on Thursday, when they have karaoke. It takes entertainment to a whole new level."
7519,2857,4,1,2/8/2012,"DRINKS REVIEW - we were early for our reservation at garces trading co a block over so we thought we would find the closest bar and grab a drink, this was it. ˜we walked in and found 2 seats at the bar and ordered martinis. ˜which is when i noticed all the guys around and then learned we were in a gay bar, not that there was anything wrong or weird about that, just a first for me. we got our drinks and they were delicious and well made and the bar was really beautiful and refined in a sense and situated by windows on the main street which is fun for people watching. the bartender was very nice and told us how they opened up a little while ago. ˜we perused the menu and it looked like really good bar, american food. ˜i definitely will be back to try it!"
10066,2857,1,1,1/25/2012,"My first review of the New Year and I'm sad to report, it's not a good one... Ohh KnOcK, where to even begin....It's restaurant week= a given 'hit or miss' experience! Tonight does NOT even come close to what is acceptable in my opinion. I just left 10 minutes ago, and had to start my review at ONCE, as it was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had, and I eat ALOT!! Lured by the tempting menu, my friend and I decided to stop in, to sample the fare. We were early for our 5:30pm reservation, so we grabbed a glass of vino at the bar. After couple of sips, the host led us to our table. Our eagerness for great food and light-hearted conversation were quickly turned into a surreal and upsetting evening. Most people would agree, that I am a pretty well rounded, well traveled an open minded individual, rarely in my 33 years of life have I ever felt more uncomfortable than I was tonight. ˜Although, we observed that we were the only women in the restaurant, never did we feel intimidated or out of place. However, our icy server really made us feel unwelcomed tonight. Our bus boy poured our water and informed us that 'Philip' will be by to take our order. Philip skipped the formalities and sauntered over to take our order. We started with the Heirloom tomato salad, he later plopped two pieces of hard sourdough rolls on our bread plates with some sort of whipped butter ˜(I couldn't be sure, as he turned on his heel and disappeared before we could ask what it was) ˜After a few minutes, he reappeared with our starter course, at first glance I could tell the tomatoes were not fresh, reaffirmed when my fork pierced into it, against my better judgment, I took a little taste, Blech!! I glanced at my friend's plate and saw the same lifeless appetizer staring back. As Philip coolly floated by our table, we debated whether to send the food back, we didn't want to be 'THOSE PEOPLE' ˜but this is simply unacceptable! He didn't seem to care that neither of us touched our plate and stopped eating all together. We finally decided to flag him down and informed him that the tomatoes were a little suspect to us and asked for new slices. He quickly swept up the plates and asked us if we wanted to get something else because 'We obviously find something wrong with the tomatoes' ˜Wait for it....EYE ROLL?! Really?! Not only did he express his disdain, that we pointed out that the food was subpar and inedible, but apparently we were really getting on his nerves now too!! GULP, we were the first reservation of the night, and he's already in a huffy mood, what will the night bring?! ˜Back to the kitchen he went, and out came our wedge salad, drenched in blue cheese dressing, which actually wasn't half bad, however the host soon brushed past our table and cooed to Philip 'let's scale back on those portions'. I was shocked at how rude and unprofessional the staff seemed to be! Onto the battered asparagus fries, crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside, however the flavor was nice and the aioli sauce was a nice compliment. My friend's fried mozzarella was very bland, but the pesto and marinara sauce was tasty. The crab cake entree was rather luke warm and salty, it was a bit soggy and could have been cooked a little longer, but the portion size was nice. The dessert was nothing to write home about, pretty to look at, but just meh and was sitting in the fridge a tad too long. My empty glass of Pinot sadly sat barren the whole night, I contemplated asking for ˜a refill, but I didn't know I could handle another awkward exchange and bagged the whole idea. As the night wore on, a nice mix of people came in, Philip seemed to be a little less bent on being rude to us or we were just so immune to it that we didn't really care as much. I can normally balance out the rating with the food to service ratio, however, tonight was unbelievably disappointing in every way! ˜I have been back to a couple of restaurants from visiting them at RW, but I could not bring myself even for a redemption drink, obviously Knock doesn't care so much, as they took my $35 and sent me on my way, lesson learned, however I take my Elite 12' status seriously, so here's another two cents (bad joke, I know) RW is suppose to 'highlight' a restaurant's potential, but dear KNOCK, please consider taking your name off the participating restaurant list, if you feel that being part of RW is a hassle and not profitable enough that tonight was the kind of food and service that was presented, it's a disservice to the industry! Sorry Yelpers, I have to SERIOUSLY disagree with the glowing reviews here, is it possible that we were at the wrong restaurant?! ˜This place is anything but, hospitable!! ˜Maybe if I stick to the liquid diet + karaoke, I wouldn't have been so twisted. Apologizes for the rant, so let me wrap this novel up: KnOcK KnOcK= nobody's home!!"
10067,2857,3,1,1/4/2012,"We've been here several times as Knock is one of our friend's favorite places in the gayborhood. The staff are warm, friendly, and not hard on the eyes! ˜:-) ˜The bar is well stocked and the staff are efficient and nearly always provide service with a smile. I also like the local vibe to the place....lots of regulars that the staff know by name. The menu is varied, there are always specials and the food is decent in both taste and price. Pizza, burgers, salads, slabs o' meat, are all on the menu. A decent variety of choices, nicely prepared. With the dining scene in Philly as hot as it is, I don't think we would have been here as often but a friend is a friend. One of these days we will give it a try for brunch."
10068,2857,4,1,1/2/2012,"No matter who you are, you always seem welcome at Knock. I was alone, waiting for friends to arrive so I sat at the bar. Within 5 min of getting my drink I was in full conversation with total strangers next to me.There aren't many places where you can do that. As for the food, it was excellent. I had the shredded short rib flat bread and just thinking of it is making my mouth water. My friends had chicken marsala and the braised short ribs. ˜Both loved their dishes. Ok...time for the fun part....THE DRINKS!!! One word....STRONG! (in a good way) my recommendations are the Golden Cadillac, Mai Tai and the traditional martini. Love this spot!!"
10069,2857,3,1,11/5/2011,"This is a sort of an upscale gay bar/restaurant in the ""Gayborhood"" of Philadelphia which generally attracts the 30+ something crowd. It's neat, clean, and orderly with a pleasant d?cor and atmosphere. They also have a dinning area which serves regular sit down, waiter serviced dinners from a rather complete menu. However, I would suggest that one stick with whatever nightly or daily special is offered. From the food I had, it's nothing I would be inclined to rave about or return for. I would rate it as a two star for the food, but four star for the pleasantness of the bar, so I averaged it out as an OK three star place."
10070,2857,1,1,9/17/2011,"Let's be honest. The people who like this place are townies loyal to Woody. You get better tasting food from a TV dinner and the service, esp at the bar, is queeny (and not in a funny or entertaining way) and slow (pathetically slow even for Philly standards)"
10071,2857,4,1,9/7/2011,"After celebrating my birthday at Valanni, we were looking for a place where some people could snack and others could drink that was nearby. ˜After a quick search on Yelp, this place came up with good reviews, and seeing that it was close by, we decided to go. ˜I'm glad we did. ˜ ˜ ˜I can't say enough good things about the service. ˜Our large group was quickly attended to, and they put some tables together for us. ˜I ordered a watermelon martini, which was very good. It was sweet, but not overly so, and with a good amount of liquor. ˜Many others at my table got food. ˜The sweet potato fries mixed with regular fries and jalapenos were really good. ˜Everyone who got mini pizza like things (sorry I don't remember what they were called) really enjoyed them. ˜Everything came out quickly. ˜They immediately brought us water, and kept it refilled. ˜ ˜ ˜ It was a good experience. ˜I will be back when I'm in the neighborhood!"
10072,2857,5,1,8/29/2011,"I am a brunch harlot. I think it has to do with my being related to Ron Swanson. Knock really blew me away with their brunch menu. OR SHOULD I SAY KNOCKED ME OVER?! No. I won't. No brunch puns. Knock was open, the morning after Irene, which merits a star right there. The host was also doubling as a server for part of the dining area and let me tell you... he was on top of his shit. My party was promptly seated and had water within a few minutes. Coffee followed shortly and my mug never went below half full. ˜Another star. So, I normally order gimmcky french toast (that day it was cookies and creme) but I decided to try their southern biscuit gravy dish. I had bacon, instead of Canadian bacon. My friends got ... they got food but really, my food just blew me away so I didn't pay attention to my friends food.* Crispy bacon, the biscuits were perfect and really... if I could have that meal every week I would be very very happy and very very fat. Every star, ever for crispy bacon with lots of melty goodness and biscuits! Our server was kind enough to bring a drink menu. I asked for a screwdriver and it was as though Lucille Bluth made it. A lot of vodka and some orange juice. Just the way I like it. Bless you Knock, BLESS YOU. Oh and I felt like such a heathen, dressed in jean shorts. Everyone else in the restaurant was dressed as EVERY man should be dressed; well. Next time I go, I'll make sure to have something a little more dignified on. *pancakes of the day; something with walnuts and fruit. My other friend had a flat bread sandwich."
10073,2857,4,1,8/22/2011,"Flatbreads? Sausage ones with brocolli and asparagus with lobster meat, mac and cheese with bleu cheese...how yummy it was! The decor was quite warm and inviting and service was excellent. What a great find in Philly!"
10074,2857,5,1,8/2/2011,"When on a weekend in Philly from RI, we ended up at Knock after being turned away at Barbuzzo and El Vez. ˜What a pleasant happenstance. We walked in to a large, boisterous after-work cocktail crowd (no problem for us.) ˜It took a moment for the host to notice we were waiting, but after that, we received excellent service for the remainder of our meal. Our waiter was attentive without being overly present. ˜Cocktails were tasty and ice cold. ˜The asparagus fries are crispy with a hint of tang from the horseradish aioli. ˜We had a caprese salad that was on special, featuring local tomatoes that were ripe and juicy; and the steak and macaroni and cheese, which, on our server's suggestion, we went light on the blue cheese (which was a great tip on his part). We rarely order dessert, but since we'd had a fairly light dinner, we thought we'd at least check it out. ˜An old school dessert tray arrived at our table, which was hilarious, though it was only stocked with cakes. ˜My feeling on cake is that it's only a vehicle for frosting. ˜So we opted for the cucumber lemon sorbet, which turned out to be more like an italian ice (the texture was extremely hard and crystallized), but tasty nonetheless. ˜We were just afraid we'd break the cocktail glass it was served in! All in all, I would definitely recommend Knock and will return next time we're in town!"
10075,2857,5,1,6/25/2011,"Bravo. ˜Finally a sensible restaurant for the area. ˜The atmosphere was comfortable and fashion appointed. The food was excellent. The chicken ceasar ˜salad was very tasty with excellent dressing and fresh greens. ˜ There was enough chicken for three separate sales. The braised short rib, though not on the bone, was tender and very tasty. ˜Since I travel for my job, I can compare this dish to many I tired throughout the US. ˜ ˜Tis ranks up there at the top of the list. The waiter, Dominic, was ecellent and very friendly. ˜He helped us decide our choices. ˜And his recommendations were excellent. ˜His personality and stories were helped to make the meal enjoyable Worhtthetrip while in Philly. ˜I'll be back."
10076,2857,3,1,6/18/2011,"Knock has a vibrant bar scene. ˜The bartenders typically make excellent cocktails. ˜During the warmer months they take over the corner of 12th and Locust which I love. ˜The transformation of the block is fantastic. The place has a nice romantic vibe and is quieter than it' surrounding restaurants. ˜Where it falls short is the menu. ˜Some of the appetizers are quite tasty, but the majority of the menu could use some excitement. ˜On a recent visit, My entree was overcooked and a little tough to eat. I can recommend this place if you want a lite bite and some drinks."
10077,2857,5,1,6/11/2011,"Walked in excited for cocktail week specials back in April not knowing it was a gay bar until the person I was with mentioned it. ˜Everyone was friendly and polite, but I really can't see myself staying here for more than one or two drinks. ˜It's such a classy place I'm pretty sure I'd room to breath. ˜Definitely a great place to start if you're in the neighborhood. ˜My one complaint? ˜The bartender kept putting glasses to be cleaned in front of us. ˜The dirty glasses were on his side of the bar, but really, there must be a better system than making us look at the dirty empties."
10078,2857,3,1,5/22/2011,"Knock's owner, Bill Wood (former owner and founder of landmark Woody's), was quite on point when he identified the need for a classy, warm, bourgeois gay bar in the heart of the Gayborhood and he hit it out of the park when he started Knock. The menu is fantastic, and the crowd is generally more polite, well-dressed, and professional than many other locales in the neighborhood. ˜Now, this is a double edged sword: ˜while it invites great conversation and gentlemen of similar backgrounds, it can also invite a mild snootiness and atmosphere ill-matched to a friendly neighborhood bar. ˜Then again, Knock isn't that corner taproom or neighborhood watering hole. ˜Instead, it's a good attempt at an upscale gay establishment. I would rate Knock higher than three stars were it not for a few factors. ˜First, while the menu is fantastic and, frankly, delicious, the prices are higher than they should be. ˜While I understand the difficulty in making a restaurant inside a bar profitable, with some creative tweaking, the menu could change and prices could go down all the while keeping it delectable. ˜In addition, the overall layout of the bar itself is awkward. ˜Instead of having a traditional wall bar or rectangular bar with good lines of sight, the bar is, more or less, a right triangle with odd vantage points. ˜Finally, I'd say that the bar is entirely too small. ˜I have attempted to take dates here to have to leave because of the scores of men crammed into a tiny space all the while empty tables sit in the dining area. ˜With some creative redesign with high top rounds instead of stationary seating areas, Knock would be a knock out of the park."
10079,2857,4,1,5/8/2011,"Stopped by for Thursday night karaoke and a few drinks with some friends; the bar was quite packed, so as soon as we had our drinks, we retreated to the [very comfortable] seating area, which was far less crowded. ˜None of us ended up singing, but it was fun to sit and watch other people sing--to my knowledge it was mostly the guy who was hosting, and he was actually pretty good! I could tell Knock was definitely more classy than some of the other gay bars in the area *cough*Woody's*cough*, but that's definitely a good thing. They have a pretty good drink menu; well priced and a vast selection, and I'd love to come back and give the karaoke a shot."
10080,2857,4,1,5/3/2011,"Recently in Philadelphia for a day to visit family and friends, I was invited here for pre-dinner cocktails. ˜Owned by Woody (the prior owner of the dimished namesake gay bar Woody's), this bar-slash-restaurant pleasantly kicks it up a notch with an appealing (if constantly crowded) interior, an oblong rich wooden bar reminiscent of Cheers, and a dining area extending through to the back of the space. ˜ What's memorable about this invention is that it 1) picks up the neighborhood by making good use of a space which has housed many failed restaurants; and 2) blends in with the revitilization of the 12th and 13th Street corridors that compose Philadelphia's LGBT neighborhood. ˜The bartenders shine, and they are more than pleasant, accomodating and deserving of their tips (albeit very busy during happy hour). ˜The drinks (as previously mentioned in another review) pack a whallop. ˜I had four rum and cokes (purchased by various friends during my time there) and consumption induced a comatose-like sleep later that night. There is a fly in the ointment, however: the food. ˜For such a fine interior, the food (pork shank, lobster and pasta in a cream sauce) were memorable only in that the dishes were horridly bland. ˜I would sooner seek flavor by running my tongue along a carpet in an inner-city needle exchange clinic. ˜The upside: the waiter was pleasant. Final thoughts: Great for drinks, company, and atmosphere. ˜Leave it at that and everyone will have a wonderful time. ˜Three stars for the business, an additional star for the pleasant staff."
10081,2857,5,1,4/6/2011,i really love this place in the gayborhood... its elegant and has charm... the food is good and there wine list great... it can be pricey so I used my credit card but well worth it... during the warm nights you can sit out side.
10082,2857,4,1,3/30/2011,"In the back, this place has perhaps what is the greatest piano lounge in the entire tri - State area, and Yelp's description doesn't even mention it ! ˜ They run it each Friday and Saturday evening ."
8205,2857,4,1,3/4/2011,"Holy moly, considering how classy their interior is, their gargantuan drinks may come as a surprise. (I sure was surprised.) I swear, one drink can easily serve two, possibly three. If you decide to forgo their cocktail hour, there's ample seating for you to wine and dine the (wo-)man of the week, for brunch, lunch, or dinner. And if you decide to forgo cocktails altogether, get yourself an orange juice and cranberry, then grimace if anyone asks what it is."
10083,2857,3,1,2/28/2011,"outdoor seating on a warm sunny sunday. hungover or not, i like the location to watch the people of my 'hood mill around. indoors at the bar, i am generally ignored as a female, but i dont mind. the bartenders are nice once i can get their attention."
8367,2857,4,1,2/23/2011,"Knock fills the much-needed niche of the classy gay bar in town. It seems worlds away from Woody's, Tabu and Q Lounge, which is precisely why it felt just a bit out of place as a stop along last night's Gay Bar Crawl. ˜ No matter, the bartenders there treated us kindly with discounted drinks that were creative and enormous. In the line chart that was my drunkenness last night, I'm pretty sure this is where the line started to take a sharp descent. It seemed like the kitchen was turning out some really awesome eats, because mostly everyone there was having dinner. Also, the Flyers game was on several TVs around the bar, which pleased me greatly."
10084,2857,4,1,2/18/2011,"Very nice bar in the Gayborhood for dining and conversation. ˜This is one of the few where you can actually hear the conversation with the person you are there with, as the music isn't deafening! ˜The food is pretty darn good and worth the trip.

""Al Caholic"" And not just one alcoholic -- I mean dozens. ˜The barflies at Knock are serious about their booze, downing classic martinis and old-fashioneds like there's no tomorrow. They're really friendly, though. ˜When I sat down at the bar for dinner and a few post-convention libations, I was immediately welcomed into the inner circle of regulars -- my status as an out-of-towner be damned. ˜(Maybe that's how they treat all the ""fresh meat""? ˜I wouldn't know.) Either way, I had a blast here. ˜The interior was sleek and classy, the bartenders were oh so sweet and friendly, and they pour a mean gin and soda. The surprising part was the extensive and mouthwatering menu. ˜I was immediately drawn to the flatbreads (the locals said that those are most popular), but I opted for a calorie-conscious dinner and ordered a salad with grilled chicken. Little did I know that my calorie-consciousness was for naught, since the salad was the size of a frickin' bathtub and had enough chicken on it to feed about seven of me. ˜There were also generous helpings of dried cherries and a sea of bleu cheese. ˜(The chef might've been a little heavy-handed with the bleu cheese, since the salad ended up a bit salty for my taste.) Luckily, I was surrounded by a bunch of hungry barflies who were more than happy to eat my leftovers. ˜(Good thing they're not germophobes.) All in all, dinner at Knock was a success, and I can't wait to ""knock"" on its lovely doors again..."
10086,2857,5,1,12/22/2010,I loved Knock. ˜The atmosphere was upscale and fun and the food was very good. ˜Will definitely return on my next visit to Philadelphia.

10088,2857,1,1,9/22/2010,"I reserved hi-top tables by the bar for a party of 20 two weeks in advance of our date. ˜I called three days prior to our arrival to confirm our party and assured everything was set. ˜As quests arrived for our party, there was no room for us to sit and they did nothing to make room. ˜We left and had to relocate a party of 20 at the last minute. ˜30 minutes after we left, a manager called my cell phone and said they have room for us now. ˜I never went back and I never will. ˜As a business owner myself, I feel this is a poorly managed restaurant. ˜If you go on a whim, with a small crowd, maybe Knock is a nice place to hang out. ˜I would not suggest having a planned event here."
10089,2857,3,1,9/19/2010,"My cousin is a regular here. After the Lady Gaga concert earlier this week, my cousin and his friends came here for a drink before some dancing. The ambiance is really nice, and for a Tuesday night it was pretty quiet, so we were able to get a table and just chat and unwind a bit. The drinks are made very well (I forget the bartender's name- my cousin was addressing him by name the whole night) and my cousin really loves it here. Perhaps on my next philly trip I will talk him into bringing me to get food here!"
10090,2857,3,1,8/22/2010,"Checked this spot out last night for a before dinner drink while waiting for a table Garces. We found 2 spots at the friendly bar and placed our order. The drink menu was fine for me but my friend, a self imposed beer snob was skeptical when he noticed ""miller lite "" on tap and his fears were realized when he found a typo on menu describing his beer as an IPA when it clearly was a pale ale. Reasonable prices for 2 drinks and the staff was friendly and attentive. I would check out again and maybe sit outside and have a lite bite."
10091,2857,4,1,7/25/2010,"What can I say, the first time I walked by this place I was looking for a nice dinner. I noticed the white tablecloths and the menu sounded delicious. I was naive to the fact this was a gay establishment and probably needed a reservation and left a little disappointed because I really wanted to eat here & I was hungry! I still haven't actually eaten here but had a martini afterwork in the outdoor seating and found it quite enjoyable and inexpensive. Maybe it was the good company that added to the experience but overall a ok."
10092,2857,5,1,5/7/2010,"I love this restaurant! The atmosphere is so nice and the food is delish!. Its a lovely place to unwind after work, they make great cocktails. ˜Also, they have a really nice outdoor seating area which offers you a nice view of the street so you can sit back, sip a good drink, eat some great food and people watch!"
10093,2857,4,1,4/19/2010,"Knock is the respectable gay restaurant in the gaybohood mecca of inebriation. I say this lovingly. While every other queer haunt is there to get you drunk and laid, Knock exists to get you there in a refined manner. The food here is quite good, the drinks are classy and strong, and the outdoor seating wins on a sunny afternoon. Just prepare yourself for the ambulance sirens and the cars careening down this busy street. Indoors, it's a smart scene with a quality bar and upgraded food menu. Think buffalo sliders over your standard cattle. If anyone gets the alligator skewers, please let me know what you think!"
10094,2857,4,1,4/14/2010,"Many many, entirely too many shameful nights out with my gay besties are followed by brunch at Knock. My first apartment in Philadelphia was shared with five gay men and my life has never quite been the same since. Most straight girls would find themselves saying that they need a night with their ""guys"", for them that means throwing back a few beers and singing obnoxiously to Journey. In my world, a hangover is not even a question when you're downing Stoli O and club sodas listening to Britney's newest remix at Tavern. Many morning's after require a hair of the dog that bit you and what I need fast is something that will not only subside my body's alcohol withdrawal, but also replenish my vitamins...this place is home to the best bloody mary's I've found in the city. Not only do they make it with absolut peppar upon request, but they don't skimp on the celery and olives, my faves. Food is pretty tasty, more often than not I order a lunch item over a breakfast, usually because the thought of eggs disgusts me, however their french toast specials always sound fantastic. I love that they have outdoor seating so I can mask my puffy eyes with sunglasses and still people watch, aaaand if no one passes by at least you're guaranteed to have a hot waiter ;-)"
10095,2857,1,1,2/14/2010,"This was a big disappointment. ˜I was really hungry when I got here, and it was raining outside, so it would not have taken much for us to have a good experience. ˜But we did not. ˜The closest there was to a vegetarian entree was the Chicken Quesadilla, hold the chicken - bland cheese on tortilla, and it cost like $10 despite total blandness."
10096,2857,4,1,2/7/2010,"Really enjoyed the space. ˜The bar area is great, the restaurant space very inviting and well-lit. Staff: ˜Cocktails prepared by Tim were terrific. ˜Tim was sassy and fun, too. ˜Keep him. ˜Tattooed barback who refused to stand still long enough to even let us look at his tattoos was a bit ridiculous. ˜Bartender who came on after Tim had an ass like g'dunk! ˜He was incredibly sexy. Drinks: ˜Like, I said, terrific. ˜My friend had several good-lookin chocolate martinis. ˜ Food: ˜Flatbread was good, filet was so-so. ˜ Really enjoyed the vibe, the breadth of the customers (age, race, dress, etc) - looks like Philly's got a gay winner here!"
10097,2857,4,1,1/5/2010,"Despite the fact I'm a straight woman, I've become a regular at Knock. I can't say anything about the food because my friend and I usually hit the Westbury because it's cheaper. What I love about Knock is that it has beautiful decor and plenty of space for socializing. The clientele is diverse, with a mix of regulars and occasional patrons. It's almost entirely gay men, so it's not uncommon that I'm the only woman there. I got lucky there this past New Year's Eve by snogging with a man who defined himself as the ""gayest straight man."" But that seems typically of Knock- unusual and interesting encounters are possible there. Every night at Knock feels a little different, which makes me want to come back. The bartenders pour the drinks strong and know how to hustle when the place is packed."
10098,2857,3,1,1/3/2010,"Knock is a beautiful trendy gay bar filled with beautiful trendy people. I've had two great experiences, but a final mediocre one dropped my score down to a 3. The first experience was last fall, when I was visiting Philly. I walked in just for drinks and was surrounded by friendly, smart, accomplished men who wanted to chat and enjoy life! Nothing wrong with that. I was recently in Phily for a couple days and went to have dinner there on the first night. Lovely cocktail, amazing caesar salad, good crab cake, nice wine, attentive service. Great! So great that I went the second night--and something had changed. The caesar salad wasn't as good, the service was harried and rushed. I actually wondered if I had forgotten to tip the night before, but when I looked at my bill, I saw that a tip had been given. So I don't know what happened--maybe they were just overworked that evening. But anyway, it dropped them from a 4 to a 3."
10099,2857,4,1,12/4/2009,"I was visiting Philadelphia over the Thanksgiving weekend, and went to Knock the evening of November 28th. ˜As soon as I entered, I knew I had found a great place. ˜I was greated warmly by the maitre d' and seated at banquette table with a great view of the whole restaurant. ˜The decor was a bit more formal than I was expecting, but that wasn't a bad thing-in fact, it gave the restaurant a lot of ambience, and while it was elegant, it was also very comfortable (and casual). ˜My waiter was friendly and competent, and the meal was very good. ˜Small detail but very impressive: ˜Usually bars and restaurants will service martinis in glasses that are on the thick side. ˜The pomegranite martini I ordered came in a very nice, thin-rimmed/lipped martini glass. ˜Very elegant. The maitre d' stopped by and chatted for a bit (very nice), and the owner, Woody, said hello and made sure that I was satisfied with everything. ˜After I was done with dinner and dessert, I wanted to go to the bar to have a drink. ˜The maitre d' had a seat ready for me, and had instructed the bartender to get me a drink. ˜That's service. I had a great time, and I would recommend Knock to anyone."
10100,2857,4,1,11/16/2009,"As a one-off visitor to Philadelphia for work, I have to say that if I ever find myself back in town, I'll head to Knock for dinner again. ˜The staff was very friendly, from the bartender who mixed my dirty martini, to the host to seated me immediately, to the wait staff who made me feel right at home at my table for one. ˜ I started with the mixed greens and chevre salad, followed by the parmesan chicken with fingerling potatoes and asparagus. ˜Although fairly full, I treated myself to the lighter side of the dessert menu, with the sour apple champagne sorbet. ˜(I had to stop myself from ordering a slab of one of the decadent-looking cakes.)"
10101,2857,1,1,11/5/2009,"Absolutely dreadful. ˜The decor reminds me of a tired Marriott in downtown Harrisburg. ˜Everytime I walk in, I'm overwhelmed by what seems to be the odor of a powerful cleaning solution. ˜ The food is dreadful on a good day. It would be difficult for the service to be worse. ˜If they know you, they appear to treat a customer well, but if you are not a regular, all you get his attitude."
10102,2857,4,1,9/1/2009,"I thought I walked into a restaurant, but I think I really walked into a gay bar that served pretty damn good food. And stiff drinks. Who cares about the label, it was a great meal, with a bonus giggle after I ordered 'sliders, all beef, well done'"
8008,2857,4,1,7/22/2009,"I like going to Knock. ˜Although sometimes I end up there in rehearsal clothes (tights, ripped tee-shirts, booty shorts) and feel like I may be judged. ˜I'm sure that's my own insecurity for not wearing a ""go out"" outfit. ˜Anyway, I am always astounded by the strength of the drinks every time I go to a gay bar with my BFFs. ˜I am a member of a collective called ""Team Gay"" (look us up on urban dictionary), and they are constantly bringing me to these new places. The last time we went to Knock, it was a Thursday night and we sat outside. I believe it was the opening night of Qfest, so it was jumpin. ˜There was karaoke happening inside, and when I walked in I thought there would be many divas belting it out. ˜Instead, it was a more subdued, older crowd crooning out some songs that I'm sure are considered beautiful, but I thought it was really boring. I was gonna jump on the mic and sing some GAGA, but they didn't even have that on the karaoke menu! BOOOORING. Anyway, I can drink lots of alcohol without getting completely W, but after 2 vodka sodas, I really was crunk! How come gay bars make the drinks so strong? I love it !!!! I'll return to Knock, sometime in the near future."
10103,2857,3,1,6/23/2009,"Knock Philadelphia .... no - I'm not demanding that you knock Philly - heaven knows it's been knocked around enough! I finally had the time to check out Knock Restaurant for dinner a couple weeks ago - and thought I'd share my two cents. First some background, Knock opened within the past year in that cursed location at the corner of 12/Locust streets - former home to Lula and other fare. Once Lula closed and the rumor mill began that Bill Wood (founder/owner of Woody's) was going to sell his bar and was shopping around for a spot do to a restaurant, all eyes turned to this intersection. If ANYONE could make something stick in the true epicenter of the Gayborhood - it would be Woody. And, it seems as if he has done just that! John and I arrived for a non-reservation Saturday night dinner prior to a show. We were a bit worried - but thankfully, it was 6pm and the host was able to give us a table, knowing we'd turn it before 8 - when the place was booked solid. We sat in the back near the grand piano - thankfully quiet. The space was quite familiar to me, as I was a strong patron of Lula and knew that space inside-out. It was amazing to see the renovations up close: from warm carpeting on the floors to a rich full color to the walls - not to mention great wood accents. The space was quite classy and just as cozy. John and I sat in the corner both - and what was interesting was to watch the spot slowly come to life as every minute passed. By the time we left, it was as if we were in another space completely! Just as good, but much livelier. Saturday night had arrived, that's for sure. Now onto the food: we both had the baby arugula salad with manchego cheese and spiced cashews - the spiced cashews really made the taste of the dish work for me. As an entree, John had the crab cakes and I had the chicken breast - it was served with a mushroom ginger broth, baby yellow yukon potatoes and chicken sausage, a full dish indeed. John's crab cakes were perfect - overflowing with crab and just a hint of breading. We skipped dessert - since we had to make a curtain - but I know we'll be returning ... perhaps not on a Saturday, since I can easily see one feeling a bit rushed at the peak dining hours. But if you're looking for a quiet getaway - consider Knock on a weeknight ... especially in the back ;) **I originally submitted this review to phillygrub.ning.com in spring 2008**"
10104,2857,2,1,4/18/2009,"Knock is one of the many gay bars in the gayborhood, also with a upscale restaurant as part of it. It mainly attracts an older crowd compared to Bump or Tavern, and most people are there for drinks. I'm no exception, having been there a handful of times for drinks, but finally went for dinner with a couple others earlier this week for the first, and last, time. The service was fine, especially given that it was our waiter's first night. He was attentive and new the menu fairly well given that he was new. The host was also very pleasant and helpful. The food, on the other hand, was extremely disappointing for a center city restaurant. I started with an arugula salad with a 'sweet citrus vinaigrette'. At first I thought they forgot the vinaigrette because I couldn't taste anything, even though I could see what looked like dressing on it, so I asked for some more. I was clearly mistaken, as the side cup they brought out was very lackluster. It tasted like extra virgin olive oil, ground pepper, and a very light hint of lime juice. No acid whatsoever, quite odd for a 'citrus vinaigrette'. The arugula also wasn't stemmed, and every bite I took ended with me covering my mouth to get the last couple of inches of stem in. For my entree, I had a lobster-brie flatbread(aka pizza), and tasted pretty blah. The crust had more of a naan taste than 'flatbread' or pizza, and the topping of lobster-brie had no seasonings whatsoever. It felt like it would make for a nice party hors-d'oeurves, naan with a lobster-brie dip, but I didn't think it made for a good dish. All in all, the restaurant is very so-so, especially given the prices. While I didn't have a full-priced $25-$30 entree, my friend did and was not pleased. I'm sure I'll be coming back for the bar, but the restaurant left me feeling bummed."
8210,2857,4,1,2/9/2009,"Now that I've actually eaten here a couple of times, I feel like I should update my original review. I still like Knock for all the same reasons, but now I also give them two thumbs up for the yummy and reasonably priced (for small plates anyway) food. Shrimp and beef skewers with apricot glaze are delish, the lobster and brie flatbread is amazing, and the chicken fingers were huge and delightfully crispy."
10105,2857,4,1,12/8/2008,"The only reason I'm knocking off a star is because they ran out of the filet medallions that I really wanted. ˜My girlfriend and I were pretty surprised when we first walked in--there were hardly any women in there at all! ˜After adjusting to that, we were greeted by the extremely friendly host--he asked what our names were and joked around with us. Definitely a good sign! ˜The interior is very soothing, with its dark wood walls and warm lighting. ˜The bright abstract paintings on the walls I could do without but that's clearly my personal taste. ˜ We were seated at a cozy table away from the window (since the host could tell that we were freezing from the outside) and our attentive waiter came over immediately to fill our water glasses. ˜We started off with drinks (my GF's Mai Thai was delicious) and settled on starting with the Parmesan chicken tenders. ˜They came out very quickly and were delicious. ˜While still clearly being chicken tenders, they were light and the honey mustard dipping sauce was excellent! After sadly finding out that they had run out of filet medallions, I settled on the braised short rib (since the waiter suggested it and said it was their most popular item) and my GF had the BBQ chicken flat bread. ˜The food came out quite promptly and man, I was not disappointed in the short rib. ˜The chili powder sauce, while giving the meat a bit of kick, was not overpowering and the meat simply melted in your mouth. ˜The mashed potatoes that came with it were also excellent. ˜The GF's flat bread was delicious and surprisingly filling for not being terribly big. ˜Unfortunately, we were both too stuffed for dessert but I have a feeling we'll be coming back here soon to try the filet, as well as dessert. ˜I whole heartedly recommend this restaurant if you want fast, friendly service as well as a delicious meal."
10106,2857,3,1,12/1/2008,"A friend of mine took me here on a recent visit to Philly. He said it was a ""gay "" restaurant. I didn't believe him because ""gay"" restaurants really don't exist in my book--but Jesus, it WAS a gay restaurant. All gay men and a few hags. Sigh. I was hoping our community had evolved enough that we didn't need ""gay"" eateries, but alas... That said, the food was pretty good. Not great, but good. But I suppose most people don't come for the food--they just want to eat around other gays."
10107,2857,5,1,11/25/2008,"I describe Knock to my skeptical friends as being like an urban ski lodge. ˜Toasty cedar smells always greet you when you walk in, the dark wood walls and faux-fireplace are highlighted by warm lights and a few tasteful mirrors. ˜This isn't your mother's gay bar. Knock is so comfortable and friendly its no wonder that you see the same faces here day after day. ˜And unlike some other places in the vicinity, its always full of friendly conversation, a competent staff and very few roofies (kidding)... There was a time when I sat at the bar at Knock 2 or 3 times a week. ˜It's my Cheers. ˜I don't have time for those shenanigans anymore, but whenever I go back, I always drag friends along because you'll never find a more friendly bar. ˜The very attractive staff always has something to interesting to say and, if you're lucky, the owner Bill Wood (formerly of Woody's) will drop a juicy story about Grace Jones riding her motorcycle through Pure back when it was the 2-4 Club. ˜True, things like this don't help Knock shake its rep as an old man's bar, a brighter, cleaner Uncles. ˜But, honestly, I just like to think of it as more grown up. ˜Its the kind of place you find in every neighborhood in New York--as cosmopolitan as Therapy; as relaxed and fun as Gym. ˜Depending on the time of night you'll find everything from party-hearty newly 21-year-olds, to 35-year-old professionals, to guys in their 60s enjoying a nightcap or a late night snack (the kitchen serves delicious flatbread pizzas until 1am. ˜I'm still craving the Lobster White Pizza). There's not a person I've met yet who hasn't enjoyed this bar. ˜Its a refreshing change of pace, a lot of fun and the kind of place where everybody feels at home."
10108,2857,5,1,11/2/2008,"My partner and I went here to celebrate our 5th Anniversary, which happens to be Halloween! We had reservations at 7pm and were taken to the back of the restaurant and away from the bar noise! Our waiters were hilarious and very diligent. The food is amazing! We shared an order of grilled calamari stuffed with crab meat. D had pan seared scallops and I had lamb chops (or as I'm obsessed with calling them lamb lollipops)! Both of our entrees were otherworldly. The fig and syrah reduction used on my lamb lollipops was complex and soothing. The amount of food was spectacular and I couldn't finish everything on my plate. We did splurge for dessert... I had the best chocolate mousse of my life and D had the densest cheesecake known to man! The coffee was really good too, I was slightly disappointed that they don't espresso. After dinner we went to the bar to have some drinks and wait for our friends to show up and celebrate with us. Being that it was Halloween, we got to meet wonderful characters - Kato, 6 Smurfs, Foxy Love, Leonidas, and the bartender was dressed up as a gay wrestler. The drinks at Knock put both Bump and Pure to shame... After 4 martinis, I was done in! All around it was a great night, great restaurant, great bar!"
10109,2857,5,1,8/30/2008,"Knock is a wonderful destination in the Gayborhood! ˜The outdoor seating will be enjoyed through the fall months. ˜Even during the rain last night, we were covered under the awning while we snacked on corn fritters and flatbread pizzas. ˜I even had a spicy virgin bloody mary that Knocked my sandals off! Bravo. ˜Can't wait to come back for Karaoke on Thursday!"
10110,2857,4,1,8/19/2008,"Though I am only 28, I feel like I have outgrown the crazy party bars! I am a fan of KNOCK! I love the style of the bar and I enjoy the food in the restaurant. It's the kind of place that makes you want to settle in for a while instead of bar hopping. Well, during most of the day. At night, it becomes a pit stop of sorts and I prefer to be there at an earlier time. Just me, but I also love the brunch. It's a simple menu which is all you need and the staff is very personable a easy-going. I believe the two who run the place are brothers and one of them has greeted us everytime. I am so glad that a great business will survive in this often cursed location on the corner of 12th and Locust. I believe KNOCK is here to stay!"
10111,2857,5,1,8/3/2008,"I recently came back for drinks and appetizers. ˜ We ordered corn fritters with a mushroom and goat cheese sauce....yum! ˜We also ordered some shrimp with beef skewers. ˜Everthing was delicious! ˜Aaron, our server, was awesome! ˜Even though it was weeks ago, he remembered what me and my friend ordered the last time we were there! ˜This totally impressed my other friend who used to be a restaurant manager. This place just keeps getting better and better! ˜Love it!"
10112,2857,4,1,8/2/2008,"Our concierge at the Loew's sent us here when we asked for a bar downtown where we could get a nice martini before dinner. ˜It was a great call. ˜We didn't eat - just came for a drink. ˜The place was lively on a Friday night at cocktail hour. ˜ The crowd was a mix of young and old, which is nice. ˜And the bartenders were REALLY nice."
8173,2857,4,1,6/27/2008,"was there last night with a very large crew. we had a blast! service was great. i didnt eat ,but my friends ordered many dif flat breads. they looked good. ˜andy p hosted ˜karoki (why do i not know how to spell that thing where people get the words to songs and sing along to music)? ha. anyway, i did not participate, but many of our crew did, it was funny and we found out, some actually have talent. i spent too much time there and my head hurts today for it."
10113,2857,4,1,5/21/2008,"Knock had been recommended to me by a bartender from another place in the neighborhood as a good meal so I checked it out and did indeed find it good. ˜The wait-staff was friendly and attentive, the decor was modern but warm, and there was a great vibe in the place. ˜I enjoyed my first visit so much I brought my work team out to dinner this week again. ˜We all had great meals and found our waiter, Aaron, sociable, attentive, and really added to the whole dining experience. ˜There was no rushing us out and we ended up staying for several hours talking and enjoying the desserts and coffee. ˜I thought the prices were moderate when you throw in a glass or two of wine, but it wasn't outrageous or unexpected. I haven't spent anytime in the bar area but it appears bustling with a nice crowd that wasn't too loud but made the space feel alive. ˜I'll definitely be back."
10114,2857,4,1,2/28/2008,"A classy gay place in Philly. ˜No, you say that's not possible.? ˜Well walk inside cozy Knock and you'll have a change of heart. ˜ The drinks are pricey compared to the other places in the hood, but Knock is new, clean, well run and a welcome addition to the otherwise bland choices for food and drink in the area. ˜I'd gush about the service but unless you're sitting at a table it's really tough to get to the bar due to its design. ˜ The wine list won me over! ˜While they have a nice choice of house selections the real luscious & memorable wines come from the list. I found the food to be just fair but the flatbread pizzas are quite tasty."
10115,4807,4,0,11/3/2014,"We arrived Sunday afternoon to a warm and welcoming establishment, we were seated immediately. The staff was very friendly and attentive. We started with the Tostones de Plantano stuffed with pork, I must say that it was delicious, the pernil was moist and flavorful. Then came the entrees, the mofongo with steak that my boyfriend ordered was ˜amazing, the meat was well cooked and the rice and beans were delectable. ˜ As to my entree the Seafood Stew, only contained 4 large mussels and maybe 1 shrimp, the flavor was good but not what I was anticipating. ˜Not too much to say about it. Will definitely come again!"
10116,4807,5,0,9/19/2014,Had lunch here today. ˜Was impressed with the friendliness of the staff. The menu had a good variety of dishes. ˜The turkey soup was delicious and nice and hot. I also had a great salad and flan for dessert. The flan was incredible. They have a large parking lot and the restuarant is easy to find. I will definitely go there again and bring friends. There is an English translation of the dishes on the menu!
10117,4807,5,0,8/24/2014,I have to say from a Puerto ricans point of view the food was outstanding! The service was excellent and the atmosphere is great a real family feel. the place is insanely clean and the food was all seasoned perfectly and very nice sized portions. I have to say i felt lile the staff really cared. which is rare nowadays when u go out to eat. i would definitely recommend this place.
10118,4807,5,0,7/28/2014,"This is one of those rare finds of an authentic Spanish food restaurant (Puerto Rican, to be exact) That boasts great food and working man's pricing. ˜We arrived to a very pleasant and inviting atmosphere and greeted warmly by the hostess. ˜Although the premise had been a former Irish pub, no old stale beer smell here! ˜I ordered the churrasco (skirt steak) with arroz con gandules (rice w/pigeon peas) and I was pleasantly surprised, as were my taste buds. ˜The churrasco was cooked perfectly to a medium finish, and no small feat since churrasco is a very thin cut of beef. ˜The wife had mofongo and since I am not a fan and she is a native South American, she gave it a ""two thumbs up."" ˜Everything was delicious and in ample portion. ˜Service was excellent in this family owned establishment. ˜ ˜ Entries are priced under $20.00 and everything is home made. ˜Don't pass up an opportunity to dine here if you are hungry for something different, and by all means we WILL be back! ˜The restaurant is open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for lunch and dinner with the hope of expanding days in the near future."
10119,4807,4,1,11/16/2014,"As soon as I heard that there was a new BYOB, puerto rican restaurant, I knew I had to go test it out.Come prepared with drinks but wine only, AND make sure you know it's only open Fri, Sat and Sun. I guess business is THAT good! We sat by the bar which does not have as much ambiance as the bigger room on the other side, but our waitress more than made up for it! She was a friendly and detailed in explaining the menu and clearly invested in the growth of the restaurant. We had the empanadas as an appetizer and got 4 nice pieces for only $5! They were stuffed with meat, pork and chorizo and were all types of wonderful. My hubby said he could've eaten these pockets of amazing-ness all night! Thankfully, I am not swayed that easily and ordered the churrasco (skirt steak) with fried yucca. Every entree does come with one side order and the fried yucca was plenty! Although I initially thought the piece of steak I received was a bit small compared to pictures posted, It was perfectly cooked (I like my meat well done, but not dry) and very filling. My hubby ordered the pernil (roast pork) and arroz con gandules (rice with black eyed peas). Which was a giant portion and melted in your mouth. The coffee was pipping out next to us and I was tempted to get some to go, but after full bottle of wine, I could not fit one more drop of anything in me! This is definitely a place to bring the family or to have a girls night. Everyone seemed to know the owners or one of the young waitresses. They have ample parking in the back too."
10120,4807,5,1,11/16/2014,"We came here for girls night dinner, 18 girls!!! We were upstairs in a relaxing, gorgeous room with a fire place and candle lit tables. They accommodated ˜the large crowd with ease and the food was out of this world! I have been to Puerto Rico and didn't have food this good. I had one of the specials, the portion was huge and the flavor was outstanding. Although dinner was large, we kept room for dessert. The rum cake was moist and fresh. Please do not leave here without getting their coffee. I can't wait to come back with friends."
10121,4807,5,1,10/25/2014,"Just went for the first time yesterday. We started with the sampler. Everything was delicious, especially the fried cheese and bacalaitos. I ordered a sandwich. It was really good but huge and I couldn't finish it so I brought half home. It was one of our guest's birthday so whatever her dessert was, it was amazing!!! I really like this place and will absolutely be going back. Maybe to ˜try the mofongo next time."
10122,4807,4,1,10/11/2014,"When we arrived Sunday afternoon, the restaurant was empty. We started off with the appetizer sampler. ""Surtido Boricua"" which included empanadas, fried cheese, bacalaitos (fried codfish fritters). and a fried plantain cup stuffed with chicharron. ˜It was plenty for the four of us to share. ˜I loved the sweet dipping sauce as well as the mayo one. The restaurant is a BYOB establishment and does not have a liquor license. ˜Vichet and I each got a fresh pina colada. ˜It was probably the best one I've ever had. It was creamy and rich, not like the fake stuff that most restaurants offer. ˜The heavy drink was quite filling. ˜I should have paced it out more. My husband stuck with a sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. ˜The Tripleta sandwich includes 3 types of meat. ˜He thought it was OK. I'm still trying to figure out what the big deal with mofongo so I ordered the skirt steak version. ˜It was very good but nothing I would crave. My cousin shared her pernil cerdo with ˜us and it was very tender, moist and flavorful. ˜I was disappointed that it didn't come with any pork skin. ˜The serving was huge. Her husband went with the EL Jubaro Churrasco steak. ˜I had a bite and it the meat was well cooked and the rice and beans were delicious. We were totally stuffed but intrigued by the dessert offerings. ˜We couldn't agree on one dessert so we got both the pina colada flan and the fried guava cheesecake. ˜Both were exceptional. ˜It was so good that I kept wanting to eat it but I had to stop. ˜The waitress insisted the coffee was amazing so my cousin's husband was the guinea pig and tried it, he said it was good. By the time we were ready to leave, the restaurant was nearly full. ˜There was also a private event that was about to take place on the 2nd floor. Our bill was $95.18 for 3 sodas 2 pina coladas 1 coffee 1 appetizer sampler 4 entrees 2 desserts I thought the prices were pretty reasonable. ˜It would be a cheap date night for a couple to bring a couple bottles of wine to enjoy with their meal. ** We sat in a room close to the kitchen. ˜At times there was loud banging. ˜Every so often we'd hear the plates and cutlery being dumped into the sink which was really loud and disruptive. If we lived closer, we'd definitely return. For food pics mami-eggroll.com/2014/10?"
10123,4807,5,1,8/28/2014,"They have been open for only 7 weeks as of end of August 2014, so I can understand how the first review might have been right, but my experience on week six was on the money. On our arrival at the location, we were impressed with the nice clean exterior of the building and colorful outdoor umbrellas in the rear outdoor seating area. There is parking right behind the restaurant. We were greeted and seated right away. The interior has been cleanly decorated with a few authentic touches that let you know this is a Puerto Rican restaurant. If you miss the few family photos, the background music is another clue this Puerto Rican food you are about to eat. The family photos also make you feel right at home. Our server was very pleasant, telling us that she was new to her role and enthusiastically said ""we'll work through this together"" which we did. It was not any work at all and she did a great job. At one point after we ordered our appetizer, two gentlemen walked out of the kitchen and immediately greeted us. They were the owners. We spent a few minutes chatting it up and they showed us around the place and the seating on the second floor, a good place for a party. We ordered the tasting appetizer which is really big enough for 3-4. It had multiple portions of several things which, unless you're familiar with the food, you're not going to recognize by name, so I won't name them. Let me just say that there wasn't a thing on the plate that we didn't like. The kitchen sent out a coupe other tasters that were not on the standard platter and they were great too. Nothing that was fried was greasy. Our lunches were authentic and tasty, with all authentic flavors done in balance. This is high praise for this cuisine as my wife is a fantastic cook and in the many Puerto Rican restaurants we've visited, she's has never come close to having praise for any of them. Yet this time, she could not stop talking about this place. Her exact words were ""they nailed it!"" It's a BYO-Wine which is another one of my favorite traits of a restaurant. Don't let the bar fool you, it is just a place to pull up and eat. Good if you're eating alone. Come explore this cuisine done well. We are going back this week with a couple of chef friends. I cannot wait."
10124,4807,2,1,7/21/2014,"Well there is one new restaurant that Lou and I will not be recommending to anyone, Buen Provecho (located on the corner of Kuser Rd and Hamilton Ave where Peasants, the The Pub used to be). Unlike it's predecessors, the food was subpar (and that is being nice). First the service was unorganized, we had at least four people ask how many in our party and then tell us they would seat us momentarily. Once we were seated, we were completely forgotten. Another party was seated a few minutes after us and right next to us, the waitress took their drink order with in seconds of them being seated, brought their drinks and took their dinner order, and not even a glance our way. I finally (nicely) got her attendtion. We started off with the octopus salad. The octopus was okay, but lacked seasoning and acid, like lemon juice and the whole thing sat in about a half a cup of oil. my boyfriend ordered the fish stew. It was inedible! The stew tasted like shellfish gone bad meets a salt lick. His replacement order was some overcooked chicken in a tasteless sauce with burnt plantain chips. My dish was supposed to be chicken breast stuffed with plantain mash and a mango sauce with yellow rice. Turns out the chef had other plans and the half overcooked, half almost raw chicken breast was stuffed with (what I was later informed) sausage which reminded me more of stale bread). The mango sauce was in a little side dish and looked like it had come out of a baby food jar. The rice was just dry. Again, the whole dish was completely under seasoned. The best thing about the whole meal (sometimes) was the cafe con leche, but even that was inconsistent. He had two cups, one perfect and the other was like burnt coffee. I love good Spanish food, this was definitely NOT good Spanish food and not worth the $45 bill."
10125,31,1,0,12/24/2014,the food took forever and it came out cold. there was a few roaches on the dining floor and serves was horrible. la comida una eternidad y sali› en fr­o. hab­a unas cuantas cucarachas en el piso del comedor y sirve era horrible.
10126,31,1,0,11/14/2014,It's like a love hate relationship. ˜One day I love this place next day I hate it .. I totally can't tell you yelper to come or not...Reason being is who is serving me... ˜ Hmmmmm. If you want domincan food come but if your looking for a setting/ambience Don't.......... DJ is great though..
10127,31,1,0,2/11/2014,"I don't know where to begin,:-) ˜I went there for lunch I stood in line I waited 15 minutes.I was totally ignored to the point when I ask to speak to a manager the manager never came out .I believe this to be because I am African American I never felt so disrespected in a place that I intended to spend my money at. I recommend that if you are not of Latin descent you are really not welcome in this establishment. I never even got to try the food and wouldn't recommend trying to food . I have many Spanish friends ˜who told me to try this place out now I regret ever going at all I left feeling less of a human being."
10128,31,1,0,4/27/2013,"If your looking for good spanish food and a friendly environment this is not the place to go. My husband and I stopped in after about two years and this place that once was welcoming to families is now a DIVE! ˜Since we thought the food would still be good we decided to order to take it back home. ˜We ordered Carne Frita,( fried pork) It was a thin sliced pork chop fried in old oil and they burnt it. ˜The yellow rice was tasteless, and the beans were wartery. ˜We also ordered the two of their ˜famous Mofongo, I asked them to put the Seafood my husband wanted in a plastic container so that it would not spill out of the take out box and they did not ...so of course the juices from the garlic seafood spilled out and into the other takeout box of Mofongo with Chicharon... now what can I say about the chicharon.. MY DOG wouldn't eat it and I'm not kidding. ˜It was old meat they must have had under a heat lamp for at lest two weeks. Dry ˜meat with alot of fat that had that old grease smell to it Lesson learned...if the place looks bad it must be. ˜I am just greatful we didn't get food poisoning. ˜Total cost of food $40.00 total value of food 1 cent. ˜You've been warned stay away....

10129,31,1,0,10/7/2012,"the worst spot ever they gave me rotten food, the service is horrible i was waiting in line the person taking orders skipped me i tried to tell her and she told me to shut up. very disrespectful, dont ever go there"
10130,31,1,0,4/25/2011,"The food in the El Merengue SUCKS!!!!!! Poor service, bad food !!!! Roast Pork (pernil) was extremely dry, rice seemed that is was cooked the day before, AND yes the oil seems to be recycled. They are so professional, the owner was laughing with his friends while clients waited upon. VERY BAD PLACE !!!!!! DO GO FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!! I WAS VERY UNPLEASED!!! Go to NJ TU CASA , whisch is right up the street going towards downtown NEWARK......."
10131,31,2,0,11/29/2013,I dont think this place was that great but people were enjoying it while they were there. I probably should have avoided this place all together and just gotten myself some pizza. I really like pizza and stuff.
10132,31,3,0,11/8/2011,best chimichurry period
10133,31,3,0,10/18/2011,Pretty good Spanish food. It's usually consistent. It's hard to communicate since I don't speak Spanish but the order is taken care of and in a timely matter.
10134,31,4,0,4/25/2013,"To be honest the food is good. I recommend ordering something that has to be cooked exactly when you order it, like a ""chimi"" because it's going to be freshly made for you. If you order something from the buffet there might be a chance that it's been sitting there for a while. They're usually pretty good with how often they bring out new food for the buffet but me personally I like my food fresh from the oven hot. Other than that It's a great place to hang out. They have a few flat screens so you can watch whatever games are on and there is always music playing. Also the waitresses/barmaids are pretty friendly. (For the fellas reading this, all the waitresses are usually attractive, especially on the weekends when it's usually packed.) Now if you want to have a good time and dance I recommend going there on Friday-Sunday night because it's really live in there. The women are pretty and the drinks are really affordable, and the music is great. The lounge section is a little tight sometimes because it's small and it can get full pretty quick. The music is great and there is always a live band paying, bachata, salsa and merengue. Everyone is pretty cool and there are never any fights or anything crazy like that By the way, if somebody is performing there, like Antony Santos or something, don't even go. It's going to be so packed that your going to feel like a sardine in a can."
10135,31,4,0,9/24/2012,I decided to take back my view that the service is spotty. It's spotty for those that don't speak spanish! if you can finagle it - it's great and attentive!
10136,31,1,1,12/31/2014,"I have been here a couple times the service was never great but the last it was terrible and insulting! I'm giving them 1 star because no stars isn't an option! ˜I went there with my family on a Sunday afternoon for lunch and these fools had us sitting there for 20 mins with water without taking our order. ˜Finally the waitress came to the table with no remorse and a my sh@t don't stick attitude. ˜There was no way, I was staying there. ˜We walked out. ˜The reviews indicating that the service here is terrible is no exaggeration! I would rather give my $6 at a pizza shop!"
10137,31,4,1,11/2/2014,"Food is good. Can be a very loud place in a Friday night. Drinks tend to have a lot of liquor. Asked for a rum and coke, tasted like they forgot the coke."
10138,31,3,1,7/16/2014,"I had previously written a review about this place but deleted it after reading it and thinking that it was too mean and directed at one particular waitress that really pissed me off. So here's attempt 2... I've been coming here very frequently over the last year and my experience with this restaurant has been an emotional roller coaster. It started out really good. ˜During my honeymoon stage with El Merengue, a to go plate was $5. ˜The women behind the counter would pile food into my tray and one plate was easily two meals for me. ˜I often got the stewed beef with white rice and a second plate of either pernil or whatever chicken they had. ˜Truth be told, I don't even really like the chicken here that much. ˜I don't know why I constantly ordered it. ˜I make better chicken at home. ˜The stew beef is consistently delish though and that kept me coming back. ˜The pernil is also delicious if you eat it that day (not good as leftovers) but I almost always feel sick after eating it because it's soo heavy. ˜Occasionally, I would come here because I was craving one of their chicken empanadas but half of the time that I came, they didn't have any. ˜Their chicharr›nes have taken years off of my life but ˜I have no regrets because they're worth it. ˜I also started ordering their soup. ˜I have no idea what kind of soup I've had here. ˜They switch up the soups often and each one that I've tried has been really good. ˜ So all was well for a few months. ˜Then they got this new server who didn't speak a word of English and was just an all around thorn in my side. ˜For some God forsaken reason, she ended up helping me three visits in a row. ˜Each time, I ordered the stewed beef which had carrots and potatoes in it. ˜Those veggies are friggin amazing cause they're cooked with the beef. ˜They are seriously sex in your mouth. ˜Anyway, this server that was trying to bring out my anger issues would pick up tiny pieces of the beef and actively avoid the carrots and potatoes. ˜One day which I will never forget, I walked here with the world's worst hangover and all I wanted was that beef with carrots over some rice. ˜There was only a small portion of stewed beef left in the tray. ˜It was some beef pieces and some carrots. ˜She started making my to go plate and she was leaving every single piece of carrot in the tray. ˜In my head I was thinking ""Who are you saving those for?! ˜The tray is now empty aside from those ~5 carrots! ˜What is wrong with you!!??"" ˜I desperately got on my phone to google the word carrot in Spanish so I could plead with her to give me them but thanks to Sprint's crap service, by time it loaded, she was already putting the lid on the child size portion of stew beef she gave me with no damn carrots. ˜I left in a rage and didn't go back for a while. ˜The honeymoon was over. I forgave them and hoped that she wouldn't be there on my next visit. ˜Well I had some other girl this time who I had never seen before. ˜She made me a big plate and charged me $6. ˜-____- ˜I was annoyed. ˜I can deal with this place and it's awful customer service for $5 a plate, but for $6? ˜They were pushing it. ˜And it's no secret that this place has terrible customer service. ˜Everybody there knows it and does not care. ˜It's rare to get help from a person that speaks English. ˜If you go after like 5PM, there will be music blasting so now the language barrier won't even matter because you can't hear yourself think let alone be able to tell the servers what you want. ˜You have to rely on pointing and nodding. ˜If it's busy, the waitresses just help whoever they make eye contact with first. ˜They don't care what order you came in and there's no formal line so that's where most customer complaints come from. ˜ I would say out of 40 visits here, I've seen a customer throwing a fit/storming out 25 times. ˜Again, no one cares because they still have plenty of customers and asking for a manager is a waste of your breath. ˜Anywayyyy, back to this $6 plate of food. ˜It was sooooo salty. ˜I swore I'd never go back. But then I did. ˜ I went back and they had something new, pork ribs. ˜They were so over cooked and chewy that I thought I was going to break a tooth but damn't, they were tasty. ˜I hate that I like this place. ˜El Merengue, why can't I quit you?! :'("
10139,31,3,1,7/9/2014,I'm a regular here and I'm going to give it 3 stars for service. It's not what it should be. Some servers act like they own the place and if u ask for one extra of anything they wanna charge u another $1 to $3 dollars. The food is good but this has become my second option for getting Spanish food when it used to be my first option!!!! They make an amazing oxtail!!! I only eat it from them!!! So that says a lot but still they have work to be done. It's def not what it used to be and some of the girls are just rude and u can't have that in this type of establishment!!! Anyways that's all I have to say
10140,31,4,1,5/28/2014,Had chicken breast al ajillo with rice and beans for only $13!! They close really late and deliver which isn't common for businesses in Newark. Beans had that authentic Dominican flavor. Being a lover of garlic sauces the ajillo was on point. Be warned though that the container was Styrofoam so it was all leaky when it finally arrived. Great portions; will definitely order something else soon.
6383,31,2,1,5/17/2014,The 2 stars are strictly for the food. The service is horrible. I won't be going back.
10141,31,1,1,5/3/2014,"I used to attend Technology High School which is directly across the street from the restaurant. I graduated in 2011 and back then the service was so DISGUSTING I made a stop there recently and I wasn't surprised by my encounters. The service is disgusting. If you don't speak English they treat you like crap , they will skip over you and take forever with your order. When asking for management ( to complain ) they give you the WORST attitude you could ever imagine. The service brings the quality of the restaurant to the ground. The food on a scale of 1-10 on a good day is a 6/7. They need to hire more bilingual staff members so that the environment is comfortable for everyone."
10142,31,3,1,4/13/2014,Been frequenting this place since 2006! Good Dominican food... The food used to be awesome between 2007 to 2009 with great variety of tasty Dominican dishes. ˜From then on the food selection is always the same with little variety (Hire back that Old Dominican lady Chef)! ˜Their Modongo is good and Bacalao (is that how you spell it) when they make it is also good on Friday. I like this place it hit the spot.
10143,31,2,1,1/14/2014,"I ""used to"" rave about this place, but truth be told the quality of food has gone down hill and the service has always sucked. The only thing I can say is that for $5 you can get a very generous portion of rice and chicken/beef/pork. The beans are horrible, absolutely no taste. The servers are rude for no reason. There are plenty of them, but no one wants to serve. What's up with that? Should you go here, you can expect to be ignored or waved off. And if you don't speak Spanish, you can definitely expect others to be served before you. At the end of the day, there are so many other wonderful Latin restaurants around. Don't go here unless you're dead broke and starving. I would not recommend this place to any one."
10144,31,2,1,11/28/2013,"Mofongo is a staple of latin cuisine. you shouldn't mess it up. if its dry then that spells disaster. Mine was! Service is spotty. Loud, but it is more of a club than a restaurant. Note to employees ˜get off your phones! Location shouldnt account for dry food and s#;++y service"
10145,31,3,1,10/19/2013,Food is very good. Staff is friendly but occasionally seem distracted when the clientele is high. Dominican music is always on point. Very affordable.
10146,31,1,1,8/23/2013,Customer service here is beyond horrendous! The women behind the counter with the same color shirts also have the same attitude to match. It's like pulling teeth to actually get someone's attention & when you finally do it's like they don't want to be bothered! The food is not good to top it off! The owner owns most of the Dominican restaurants in the area & this one by far is the worse!
10147,31,1,1,8/14/2013,"Like the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for."" This place is a disgrace to the cuisine of my country that I myself can cook like nobodies business so imagine my disappointment. But what can you expect from a place that's got Mexicans hiding in the back cooking food that is not native to them. Any really good dominican food will taste even better the next day you eat it. What they serve here is an oregano sour orange and garlic flavored mess. Do yourself a favor hit up NYCs wash heights for the real deal. FYI service is horrible most of the girls are rude or just straight up absent minded and ignore you."
10148,31,1,1,8/14/2013,This place is spacious. But lacks in customer service. The food is ok. Not the best Dominican food around. They have food cooked already and you just pick what you want and go or you can choose to stay and eat there. Overpriced food menu. Worst mofongo I've ever had. Not an extremely clean place but it's also not in a great area.
10149,31,2,1,7/31/2013,"My friend was jonesing for some mofongo and I threw in an order with his, though we remained skeptical due to the less than favorable reviews of most Newark restaurants that offered it. Rather than be star snobs we went ahead with it though. I hate being validated in my pessimism, but I should probably trust my instincts more. I ordered the mofongo with chicharon de puerco and he ordered the same but with chicken. The mofongo was dry and pasty as if scraped from the neglected corners of a buffet tray. The chicharon was almost inedible. I broke my fork trying to stab at it and eventually took to pulling it with my teeth like a beef jerky (which probably would have been an upgrade). This was more of a 1.5 star experience as I wrestled with the idea of going AWOL and abandoning this $10 mistake in the nearest furnace. My friend knows his way around mofongo and good Spanish cuisine in general and he was just as disappointed."
10150,31,2,1,7/24/2013,"Im dominican, I love my food, Ill go wherever to get it and this place is close to my school... At first I didnt have complains (1 1/2 year ago), I even remember going there and is was usually full of people... Now is a complete nightmare... the food you just have to have a lucky day... one day is amazing the next day isnt that great but edible... I really dont have a lot to say about the food because overall its ok, but the service TERRIBLE!!!!!!!! the girls working there are never paying attention to customers entering the establishments, you have to call them up for them to take care of u, then they give u an attitude like if you were bothering them... when I was done I waited like 15 mins for the waitress to at least look at my table so I can ask for the check but she would ignore me and kept looking at her phone. when I finally got tired stood up and went to the register, she came with the biggest attitude and basically threw my credit card back at me because I signed with no tips... like really, Its really sad that this girls are there giving such a bad service and such a bad and unfriendly representation of my country.."
10151,31,1,1,4/30/2013,i went to get feood to go and i waited about 15 minutes and left because these waitresses have no manner they ignored me and kept walking by me a hundred times and none of them took my order and i was the only one waiting. terrible service
10152,31,1,1,2/9/2013,"Horrible horrible service. I've never been so insulted by a restaurant before. I happen to work with a lot of Hispanics and we always order together from here. However anytime i call at home to order they seem to despise the fact that i am not Spanish. I often get placed on hold forever and sometimes hung up on. A few nights ago i tried to order and the Spanish lady on the phone told me the kitchen was closed! Then she had the audacity to say that i should speak Spanish and ""she no speak English"". Very very disappointed by this racist attitude and im not the first to complain about it judging from other reviews. The food is not even that good or healthy for them to be treating people like this. I just liked the large portions and the fact that its cheap."
10153,31,5,1,1/10/2013,"The atmosphere is comfortable but a bit ragged, but who cares. ˜For the price and freshness of the food, this place can't be beat. ˜Huge portions of delicious food for under $10. ˜One of the servers usually speaks English."
10154,31,1,1,7/30/2011,"There's waaaaay better Dominican food within a 8 block radius then Merengue. I've tried to make it work but with the dry day old rice, horribly slow racist service.... Not happening. Please DON'T* have high expectations for this place & make sure you speak Spanish or they will ˜serve you last. I've given this place a few tries, and every single time I go they ignore me or tell me to wait, and people will come in after me and be served!! As if I didn't just walk in before them! I don't like to play the race card but it's pretty obvious here, I've been theyre 5x, the first 3x I was by myself and they totally bypassed me or told me to wait, the last 2x when I walked in with a light skinned puerto rican... best believe i wasn't ignored than. They're food honestly is crap, I know on the weekends this place is hott... but cmon let's be real for a moment, this isn't in the best area of Newark so it's not like these ppl have anything better to do. Long story short... SET YOUR EXPECTATIONS LOW and you'll be happy lol Smh"
10155,31,4,1,3/25/2011,Great food for ˜a cheap price. ˜Rice and food is always fresh. Cheap and the waitresses are nice. ˜You can grab a beer or alcoholic drink. ˜Their pernil is alway on point. THeir chicken is a little greasy but still delicious.
10156,31,2,1,3/11/2011,"I tried ordering from here once before and gave up because they kept me on hold forever only to hang up on me. So today I gave it another shot and again the ladies accidentally Hung up on me twice. I can imagine how much business they lose by poor handling of calls ˜I speak Spanish so language is no excuse. Once I did order my monfongo with pork chicharron it took a little less then an hour to get here at lunch time not bad. I asked for a sauce with my monfongo but it was never sent, they did send onions saturated in garlic & oil which along with chicharron is a heart attack waiting to happen. Portions are generous, the plaintains had good flavor but the fried pork was old tasting its as if they recycled the oil for a year. ˜Overall not pleased id rather have the monfongo from Mannys a little hole in wall spot on Market st."
10157,31,1,1,12/24/2010,Very disappointing.... don't waste your time... The pernil is dry ˜and tasteless... buffet style food that is just not good... The neighborhood is not the best neighborhood either... You can definitely wind up down the wrong block if you don;t know the area.
10158,31,3,1,6/16/2010,"So far good Dominican Food I've tasted in NEWARK! I like the Mofongo with chicharon de puerco. mmm'mmm....... I also ordered various tray's for my Daughter's Communion Party and they were on time and it was pretty good! It's also a Bar and Lounge. -_- I haven't found a better one, YET... The food is a tiny bit greasy, but not bad."
10159,32,2,0,4/18/2012,COOL LOGO and MANY options... Underdogs Saving Grace. ˜I just can't bring myself to wait in long lines for hot dogs and paying an arm and leg for one.

10161,32,4,0,11/14/2014,"I started ordering delivery from this place (when they delivered). The delivery always took 20 minutes or less. ˜I really like the chihuahua dog. The chipotle mayo and some kind of cheese topping make the taste perfect. The fries are pretty good too and you can chose from a bunch of dressings they have. You might need atleast 2 hot dogs for a meal as they are kind of small but really good, I have also tried the michigan dog which was fine too."
10162,32,4,0,12/21/2013,"Just discovered this place. Had the haute dog parm in a combo. Sausage was good, fries were great. Intrigued by the many menu offerings. Centrally located, low-frills location. ˜Will definitely go back to try some more."
10163,32,4,0,2/25/2013,"I would give this place five stars, but it is contributing to my already expanded waist-line. So far my favorite is either the Buffalo Gal or the Coney Island. I am a bit scared to try some of the more out there dogs, but hopefully will get my name on the wall. The people are nice and it's good to find a place open at 3am on a weekend. Only wish they were open later on the weekdays. The dogs are very filling, be warned...and addicting."
10164,32,4,0,11/26/2012,It was a tasty and enjoyable experience.
10165,32,4,0,9/26/2012,"I have never had anything bad here. I am not sure if that's because hot dogs can't be that screwed up, or if they really do that good of a job. At the same time, nothing has really blown me out of the water. That being said, I get to try something new and the service is always very helpful. The fries and sauce choices are also excellent."
10166,32,4,0,7/13/2012,"With Underdogs really close to my hotel (Sofitel), I decided to go there one day. The Warsaw is SO good, the polish sausage is really spicy, and works good with the sweet onions. The fries are pretty good, and the garlic aioli works wonders with it. The problem is really the price. It's 7 dollars for a hot dog and a soda, which is pretty pricey. Underdogs is delicious, but really too high of a price :("
10167,32,5,0,9/28/2013,"I stumbled upon this place by accident coming from my attorney's office, a little down. Yikes!-did this place raise my spirits! I tried the California Dog with guacamole and small fry with Thai peanut sauce. AMAZING! The guys behind the counter were very cool, and waited while looked over the many, many, choices. As great as the dog was, the french fries were the best I have ever had. The sauces for dipping topped the meal off well. 'Gourmet' hot dogs seems an oxymoron at first blush, but this place absolutely deserves the superlatives other raters use. Five stars belittles this establishment-it's even better than that. Kj from DC"
10168,32,5,0,8/12/2012,great place. ˜great dogs. ˜great owner. ˜glad to have a place like this in the illadelph
10169,32,5,0,6/5/2012,"This plce is amazing. ˜My crew from work heads there on Fridays for lunch. ˜The food is delicious (the hot dogs and the accompanying fries), the portions are sizable, the prices are cheap, and the service is quick. ˜What else do you want in a hot dog joint?? ˜The staff themselves are very nice, helpful and are always polite. ˜If I had to force myself to say anything negative, I would say the location is a little tiny so seating is limited. ˜However, the amazing food more than makes up for it. ˜Highly reccomend the Warsaw Packed!"
10170,32,5,0,5/24/2012,"I am in love with this place. ˜I use to think hot dogs were boring, but this place has so many delicious combinations that I keep coming back. ˜I dream of the fries and dipping sauces. ˜Heaven. ˜If you're a celiac like me, try the gluten free buns!"
10171,32,5,0,3/19/2012,These guys are amazing. As a vegetarian I'm gonna go ahead and say they have the best vegan dog i've ever had... The bbq mustard and malt vinegar aioli are fantastic. Tons of spicy mustard to go around and it barely dents the wallet. My new favorite center city spot...
10172,32,5,0,3/10/2012,"Boy oh Boy!!! If you haven't had the opportunity to feast on one of these delicious dogs....then you surely are missing out! And let's not even mention the yummy fries and the out of this world dipping sauces....I am forever a fan of Underdogs...I ordered the Marrakesh and had the curry mayo dipping sauce with my fries, and I had no complaints at all. ˜I can't wait for my next dog! If you like hot dogs or sausages....hurry....I said hurry!!! and get on down to Underdogs to satisfy your lunch craving you won't be disappointed."
10173,32,5,0,3/8/2012,"I love hotdogs-anywhere in the world will try them (skip the ones in Cuzco, Peru) and got a chance to put my first visit to Underdogs one flight down in a cheerful (ah the smell of dogs) little place on 17th. ˜Packed with other fans of the classic dog - all whoofing down beef dogs but with lots of other choices (even though they did not have Rippers, a boardwalk or a ballgame) . ˜Today went with the classic Coney Island - mustard and sauerkraut - and it was great - top 10% of the 1000's i have eaten - maybe even a higher ranking if the bun was a bit smaller and the doggies had a bit more crunch- but smack down the fries as they are great - for $7 had a top end lunch -- will be back to try some of there other dogs - recommend unconditionally."
10174,32,5,0,3/4/2012,"My husband and I haven't had a hot dog in years and so when my daughter recommended we try out Underdogs, we were not quite sure what to expect. But, we were more than pleasantly surprised when we found out that there was a veggie dog option and even more so when it turned out to be totally delicious. The Chicago Dog was reminiscent of the hot dogs I loved when I was younger, but better with fresh toppings and a really fresh gluten free roll. This is not your icky tofu pup. The spices, texture and taste were the best I have had. There were many different types of ""dogs"" including turkey, lamb and even a seafood sausage, all with lots of different toppings to choose from. We will definitely be back, and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a healthy, fun eating experience."
10175,32,5,0,3/4/2012,"This place does a really nice job. ˜I went with the pero caliente, which has some kick to it and was very tasty. ˜The buns are great as are the fries. ˜I really liked the variety of dipping sauces (try the garlic aoli). ˜Seems like a good lunch and/or late night spot, something a little different and affordable. ˜Highly recommend checking it out."
10176,32,5,1,1/7/2015,Great dogs. Great fries. Great prices.
10177,32,2,1,12/14/2014,Expected it to be better with all the hype. Executing a good hot dog shouldn't be difficult but in the end what made it lack luster was a poor choice of bun. The bread just ain't good. #TryHarderPhilly
10178,32,3,1,11/27/2014,"-3.5 stars- We stumbled into this joint a bit before 2am on a Saturday night because Monk's Cafe's kitchen had closed and this was on our way back to the hotel. We're fans of Crif Dogs from NYC, and I'm an even bigger fan of Soul Dog in Poughkeepsie (a true underdog, given its location), so we were excited about the late night meal. And it made for a pretty good late night meal. I threw some onions, sour cream, and cheese on a dog, and I also went for the special dog covered in broccoli and mac & cheese. Boyfriend also went for the broc & mac & cheese dog, as well as something covered in cheese and peppery spice. The fries were also good, though by the time we got to those, we realized that we definitely ordered too much food. Dip them in the garlic aioli or, even better, the Utah fry sauce. If anything, I wish I could have brought buckets of the Utah fry sauce back with me. It was incredible. So, definitely check it out if you're in the area. I'd bump it up to a 4 or maybe even a 5 if the hot dogs were a little better constructed... the toppings were kind of thrown onto the dogs, and that made eating them a little dicey. The could take some dog crafting clues from Crif Dogs or Soul Dog."
10179,32,5,1,11/12/2014,Seriously Underdogs. 9pm? Why can't you be open all the time?????? Lol I want a Buffalo Gal! :)
10180,32,4,1,11/11/2014,"Pretty good dogs! Got two: The Chicago was definitely my favorite with yellow mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, sport peppers, dill pickle spear, and celery salt. Very tasty (and spicy!)! The Coney Classic was the most underwhelming: the sauerkraut fell flat (see Frankford Hall for stellar sauerkraut!) and nothing special was done to the dog to lift it up, save for the addition of spicy mustard. and tasted a third: The Chihuahua was great: chorizo sausage with saut?ed onions, chipotle mayo and queso blanco crumbled on top. The fries were middle-of-the-road fine. Not as thick as normal steak fries. Not as crispy as they could (should?) have been (a bit limp, in fact). Not the best, and not the worst, was the table's consensus. The spot itself is roomier than it looks from the outside: descend a handful of stairs to a dimly lit half-basement location. The floor was generally sticky. The tables were clean, but the trash can had definitely had food smeared on it as people emptied their trays and was a bit gross to touch. The clientele was mostly male, but a few parents were dining with their kids. Overall, Underdogs seems like a nice place for a quick bite. Their menu may not be as cheap as the food carts', but they're good and certainly not as pricey as many offerings in the Rittenhouse area."
10181,32,4,1,11/8/2014,"Really yummy hotdogs here! They're all different but delicious. I had ""the Michigan"" which is chilli, onion, cheese and mustard and it was amazing. The fries are great and they have different sauces. I had the ""serracha"" the lady said itd be spicy, but it was wasn't and was still good. My friend had ""pero caliente"" with chipotle mayo and she enjoyed it as well."
10182,32,5,1,10/17/2014,"I know I shouldn't write reviews at 1:12am, but underdogs was our ""late night"" snack after a great Friday night. I'm quite a ""foodie"" as they say, and the fact that I can get a merquez sausage at 1am is something special to me! Rachel the ""keeper of drunks"" was awesome, and super helpful and funny to us at 1am, knowledge and friendly, she was great! I didn't bother to read the other reviews, I just know it was a great late night snack and anyone crying isn't giving underdogs their just-do's!"
8304,32,3,1,10/3/2014,I got the California dreaming hotdog- avocado/lemon/tomato dressing. It was 4 bucks plus tax. The hotdog was ok but with the topping it was different. I'm not sure if it's worth 4 bucks.. prob not.... but I would try it here once. I might come back and try the other kinds of hot dogs next time. It's open late...I could see this being a good drunk spot for a late night snack. I saw a debit pin thing so I assume they take card but I brought cash (in case)!
9012,32,4,1,9/15/2014,"This has been on my list of places to go since I've heard of it 2 years ago and finally made it! ˜So definitely a good choice to go to post-drinking. ˜It was around 9pm, after a day-load at Monk's, we were getting the munchies and perfect end to a fun afternoon. ˜Being the lady that I am, I got the Texas Tommy. ˜Wrapped in bacon and topped with cheese?? ˜There goes my ""diet"". ˜And I got a ""good for you"" response from one of the servers :) ˜But it was sooo good. ˜And that sriracha mayo I got with the fries were also just as good. ˜I admit, the grease hit me all at once, and only made it through half the fries. ˜And I liked the thick and slightly crispness of the bread. ˜This place hit the spot. ˜And WAAAY better than this hotdog place I tried down in Sea Isle a few months ago."
10183,32,5,1,9/6/2014,"I really dig this place. ˜You walk down an open stairway into a basement setting, filled with old pictures of the local sports greats and 80's music going on in the background (few song from the Police and A-Ha). ˜The menus is split into your more traditional, local dog choices and some of your more creative variation of dogs. ˜Their combos come with a good set of fries, sauce of choosing, and a drink for about eight bucks. ˜The gentleman behind the counter was very friendly, took our order and sat down. ˜In a very reasonable amount of time, they brought the meal over to the table. ˜I ordered a Ninth Streeter and my soulmate ordered The Michigan. ˜It was great experience and food was excellent! ˜There's probably close to twenty different hot dogs on the menu that can keep you busy for a while. ˜Top dogs at Underdogs!"
10184,32,4,1,9/4/2014,"As the old saying goes, everybody loves an underdog. And these underdogs are no exception. But we aren't talking your Disney feel-good sports movie underdogs here. Underdogs is much more literal here - delicious ""gourmet"" hot dogs with a wild variety of unique toppings, served from a small corner shop ""under"" the street level on 17th Street. (Get it? UNDERDOGS?) Despite all of the great upscale dining we had treated ourselves to all week, I had my eye on Underdogs since we checked in across the street at the Latham. Gourmet hot dogs? Open Late? Underdogs was the perfect place to stop for late night munchies after having a few pints on my last night in town. I texted the wife to get her order and headed over to get me some Underdogs. The interior of Underdogs is small but functional, with a handful of booths for eating in, but it seems they do most of their business with takeout/to-go orders. Being an Underdogs ""virgin"" (and a little bit drunk) I was a bit overwhelmed by the 23+ hot dog selection I had to choose from. I didn't see the rotating specials lined up on the side wall and had a bit of buyers remorse from not noticing the hot dog topped with mac and cheese until after I ordered, but I was happy with my selections. I ordered two Texas Tommy's - one for the wife and one for me - which are wrapped in bacon, deep-fried, and topped with cheese. I also ordered one Michigan Dog - known in Michigan as a Coney Dog - a classic beef dog topped with ""Coney"" chili sauce, cheddar, and mustard. I had to get one ""off the grid"" hot dog, so I rounded out the order with a My Thai, topped with spicy peanut sauce and Asian slaw. I also got a large order of fries, which comes with two of their house dipping sauces. (I went for the Old Bay Mayo and Garlic Aioli) The total for all of that was a bit over $20, and when ready I was handed a huge bag full of late-night munchies goodness. I headed across the street to the Latham and the wife and I began to tear into some Underdogs. Overall, we thought the Texas Tommy was the weakest. It looks like the cheese is put on right after the dog comes out of the fryer. It melts fast, leaving a rather dry hot dog. A cheese sauce would be better here. I really enjoyed both the Michigan (nice chili) and My Thai (slaw and peanut sauce worked perfectly) and their fries and sauces were fantastic. I wish they gave you a larger portion of the dipping sauce, and extra sauce costs $.25 a pop. The hot dog they use is a quality dog, but they offer other sausages as well, and this is where they get really creative. Sure, you can get ""The Brats"" - a traditional pork bratwurst with kraut and horseradish mustard. Or you could go for something like ""The Tryp"" - a smoked turkey dog topped with stuffing, gravy, and cranberry relish. Everything I had featured the traditional hot dog, but I definitely want to try one of this crazy sausage concoctions on a future visit. (And I promise Underdogs, there will be a future visit)"
10185,32,1,1,8/29/2014,"I have never in my life seen such an unprofessional staff. Please hire people with some education because it is very sad to have to use the restroom while the person I was with was pregnant and wanted to see the menu, she then didn't see anything she liked and was yelled at by a woman of larger frame "" if you just wanted to use the bathroom don't make pretend you are gonna order"" ˜Never in my life have I ever heard or could fathom a person of hospitality saying those words... Seriously need to pull it together."
10186,32,5,1,8/25/2014,"Okay so...I am obsessed with Underdogs. It is hard to explain really, but they are just great. I went for the first time about a year and a half ago. I have never been disappointed. There are SO many funky and unique hotdogs. My absolute favorite is ""The Tryp,"" which is Turkey Sausage with stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce. YUMMM. I also really like ""The Adonis,"" which is lamb sausage with lettuce, tomato, onions, and tzatziki. Even just these two examples should give you a picture of how fun the hotdogs at Underdogs are. I have tried about seven or eight of the hotdogs. If you try all of them (there are 23), you get your name on the wall! That is my dream :) This place isn't for the pretentious eater. It is just for people who love trying fun, interesting, casual foods."
10187,32,3,1,8/23/2014,"I've been to Underdogs a few times and the most recent was after a year hiatus. ˜Have things gone downhill at this joint, or is it just me?! First, one improvement - they now take cards! ˜For someone who relies on her debit card for all purchases, this is major. I ordered a few dogs to go and was super excited to bite into my Manhattan-style dog, but was semi-disappointed when I did. ˜It was flavorless and didn't remind me of the Manhattan I used to get at Underdogs a few years ago. Maybe I just got a bad dog though."
10188,32,4,1,8/19/2014,"Like Yelper Majilinda K, I am not a big fan of hot dogs (or other forced meat products), but once or twice a year, I will venture out with my best office mate and head over to Underdogs for a quick lunch. ˜ Underdogs not only has replicated Detroit's counterpart to Philly's cheesesteak, namely the Coney Dog, but Underdogs has actually improved upon it. ˜Underdog's Michigan dog itself was well-spiced, firm and juicy, and the chili topping was rich and flavorful (and not thin and runny as is actual Detroit tradition). ˜ The accompanying fries still had the peel on them, my favorite, and were crisp and well-seasoned. ˜ Highly recommend, especially to the frankfurter and sausage fans out there."
6629,32,4,1,8/11/2014,This place is great. I love hotdogs and no place better than here to expand your horizons on gourmet toppings.
10189,32,4,1,8/8/2014,Yummmy gourmet hot dogs!! ˜Amazing fries with a bunch of different unique dipping sauces.
6576,32,2,1,8/7/2014,"Just a recap, I first came here on a Thursday at 8:50pm and they were closed, even though they were supposed to be open until midnight during the week. There were no signs in the window or anything... So fast forward 2 months and 3 (successful) visits and I'm still not impressed, at all. I've tried 8 different dogs and none of them stood out. You can't help but to have expectations when you see such unique looking food and I think that might be some of the reason why I'm so let down. The dogs definitely look way better than they taste. I'm not saying they're bad, I just think they were all a little on the bland side. The thing that irritates me most about Underdogs is your toppings depend on what type of mood the cook is in and/ or how busy they are. Of the few times I've been there, I've never had a dog loaded from end to end with toppings like some of the pics that I've seen on this site. That in itself was a major disappointment... On the plus side, I like their name and the decor. Especially the throwback sports pics. And though I don't think I'll be going back for anymore dogs, I can say that they have some of the best fast food fries that I've had in the city and their 13 fry sauces compliment them very well. They are very addicting. I can totally see myself going there at 2am and binging on fries with a few different sauces."
6784,32,4,1,8/5/2014,"This is such a wonderful find in the Rittenhouse area! ˜There are so few economical options in the area so underdogs is a breath of fresh air. ˜One of the best things about underdogs is the owner. ˜He is a super ""real"" person and is passionate about his business and his food. ˜The last time we were there he let us try a new cookie recipe that he had been working on perfecting. ˜So, I am not that much of a hot dog person but I think that if I were I would be in heaven. ˜There are about 40 different hot dog options and various dipping sauces. ˜You can have them with or without fries. ˜I like how the name of the establishment - Underdogs - corresponds with having to walk underground - - this is a basement establishment. ˜I love independent places like this and hope that this business continues to thrive!"
10190,32,5,1,7/30/2014,"If you like hot dogs (heck, even if you don't) run don't walk to this place! I want to start off by saying I do not generally eat hot dogs but only stopped by here through word of mouth. The place is located kind of in the basement of the building,(so below street level) on 17th street. I ordered a ""California dreamin"" hot dog because I absolutely love avocado. It came with avocado, tomato and lemon mustard vinaigrette. The service was super quick and I got the hot dog in no time. The hot dog was super yummy! The meat was cooked to perfection and it was very juicy. The sauce and toppings combination were great as well. I would love a jar of the lemon mustard vinaigrette. They had an incredible selection of other hot dog specials so I am definitely coming back to try them all! The price is a little high but the quality is great!"
10191,32,4,1,7/16/2014,"Nice Selection. Nice prices. I got the vegan Chicago meal. Only issue- It was really a sausage not a hot dog. But it tasted great, so who cares. The fries were great as well and comes with a choice of dipping sauces. Roll was just okay. Will try the gluten free roll next time."
9053,32,4,1,7/7/2014,"Wow Underdogs you are no longer the underdog! Countless times I have walked by this place passing over eating here while I envisioned the boiled hot dogs that are peddled by vendors on the street. Let me start by saying I was very wrong to walk by Underdogs so many times. Their menu is vast and creative. Everything is priced very fairly also. The combinations with fries and a drink run $7-8 and individual hot dogs are anywhere from $3-5. I must applaud Underdogs for totally changing up the hot dog game. My girlfriend and I came in late night and tried the Buffalo Gal and Tommy Trash combo. The fries were very yummy- crispy but not overdone. The Buffalo Gal was delicious spicy buffalo chicken sausage with blue cheese dressing and crumbles, and shredded celery and carrots. The Tommy Trash might become the ultimate in hot dog indulgence as it is wrapped in bacon, fried and topped with melted cheese. Move over Chili cheese dog there is a new front runner for hot dog royalty. Of course Underdogs offers a chili cheese dog they call The Michigan with beef chili, cheddar, chopped onions and mustard. I will have to come back soon to try some others that look so tempting, on my list are: My Thai: with spicy peanut sauce and green papaya slaw The 9th Streeter: Esposito's spicy Italian with saut?ed peppers and onions The Chihuahua: chorizo sausage with saut?ed onions, chipotle mayo and queso blanco The Marrakesh: spicy merguez lamb sausage with harissa mayo and Mediterranean salad Also check out the daily and weekly rotating specials!!"
10192,32,4,1,7/6/2014,"We stopped here as we we super early for our dinner reservation in the city. ˜We decided to get the Chicago Style hotdog. ˜I must say that I usually am not a huge fan of hotdogs but this was just any hotdog. ˜It is piled with other goodies that tickle your tastebuds in just the right way. ˜At 4$ for a hotdog, they better be good. ˜I would go back here, there are many different variations of toppings and they even have a veggie dog which apparrently is just as good!"
10193,32,3,1,7/3/2014,"Came here for a late night snack. I would compare this place to Chicago hot dogs. Their menu is full of so many options. I ordered a beef hot dog with cream cheese, fried onions, and jalape?os. It was tasty but the hot dog itself was nothing special. It was the toppings that really made it. Their fries are awesome and the dips are even better. They have gluten free buns which are so rare to find. Perfect for anyone with a gluten allergy. The establishment itself is beyond dirty. I really regret eating inside. I honestly thought that bugs were going to come out of the floor and eat me. Ok, maybe that's a little extreme."
10194,32,4,1,6/23/2014,"Arrived today for a wonderful lunch at this establishment. I wish I could take on the challenge of eating all 23 options. Alas, I am not downtown enough to do that. I ordered the Texas Tommy! It was pure bliss in my mouth, From the first bite to the last. I loved the taste of the hot dog, it is superior to any home variety. And many other dogs that I have eaten. It is flavorful and juicy. The melted cheese was awesome, although I am not sure I ever tasted the bacon. It was still awesome. I loved the bun as well, it was naturally crispy. Why is an awesome establishment a 4 and not a 5? Well it is hard to overlook the dirty floor and walls that need a cleaning. I liked the service, it was friendly and the dogs were delivered to the table. If the establishment was only clean it would have a 5 star rating."
10195,32,5,1,6/23/2014,"It doesn't even matter if you like hot dogs - you will love hot dogs after eating here. Also, best fries in the city. Well, I have to go, but it's been really nice talking to you."
10196,32,3,1,6/20/2014,Solid roster of offerings. The sausages are better than the dogs. ˜Good mix of toppings. ˜ Chicago Dog had relish but not the required neon green. ˜Way too much mustard hides the dog and over powers toppings. The mustard cost them a star. ˜ ˜Service is quick. food was hot
10197,32,4,1,6/6/2014,"Great dogs, great fries, and great variety of menu items (most of which can accommodate a tofu dog in place of a beef dog). It's refreshing not to have the vegetarian option be some healthy salad-based alternative. We vegetarians want the same caloric gut punch as carnivores, just without the meat! And at Underdogs provides it. The only thing that could use some improvement is the buns. They're not particularly soft. I imagine that they're fresh, but they don't feel it. The Underdogs d?cor is an added bonus. The posters of Roberto Clemente, Jackie Robinson, and Tommie Smith & John Carlos on the wall make me very, very happy. But not as happy as ordering the Tryp with a tofu dog."
10198,32,4,1,6/5/2014,"After a night of drinking, you cannot do better for late night food than Underdogs. And this rating is despite me having a PB&J dog, which I found awful (though my friend scarfed down two). They have something like 40 different styles of hot dogs, and more people watching than you'll know how to handle."
10199,32,2,1,6/5/2014,"Stopped in here for lunch one day on a whim, after walking by it numerous times. ˜ This is a place that offers every imaginable version of a hot dog, the menu is almost overwhelming with the choices. ˜ I probably should have opted for something traditional, but the ""Marrakesh"" appealed to me (spicy lamb sausage, harissa mayo, chopped cucumbers). ˜The sausage itself was OK, but the topping didn't really have the flavor ""pop"" that I was expecting for a place that seems to pride itself on its toppings. ˜Worst of all, the bun was dry and tasteless. ˜Any storebought bun would have been better. Not planning to come back here anytime soon."
10200,32,3,1,6/3/2014,"This is a small unassuming place to grab a hotdog. It is actually quite easy to miss since it is on the lower level of the sidewalk. ˜When you walk in, you will notice that Underdogs has a dive like feel to it. The three hotdogs that I tried were the: California Dreaming which has avocado, tomato and a lemon mustard zing to it. I wasn't too crazy about the lemon mustard taste. I felt it sort of ruined the taste of the avocado. Chicago Style has yellow mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomatoes and peppers. I also put some ketchup on it. This was my second fave. Warsaw which is a smoked kielbasa with saut?ed onions and spicy mustard. I really enjoyed the smoked, meaty flavor of this. This would probably be my first choice. French Fries w/Chipotle Mayo. They use peanut oil for the fries and they are very good! Very oily but, quite good. Realize if you are coming here you will experience a very fattening meal. This is not a place for those that are health conscious. The toppings are incredibly fresh on each dog, which I can appreciate. My major gripe unfortunately was the hot dog bun. It was too much bread that tasted a little dry. For me the bread ruined the hot dog. If the hot dog bun was more soft and flavorful then it would make the dogs a lot more flavorful and they would have more of a kick to them. Also, less of all that dry bread could actually increase sales. People are probably filling up on all that bread. One hotdog here is very filling. It is enough to hold you over. ˜I came with my husband and had him polish off the rest of the dogs. I only took one or two bites of each. Also, underdogs isn't the cleanest either. They need to do some cleaning, especially their floors. They have an ATM here which initially made me think that they were cash only but, they do accept credit cards. If you try each of the dogs here your name is put on the wall. They also have dog punch cards. The customer service is good here and they are friendly and attentive. Underdogs has lots of good traits, all they need to do is some cleaning and change the hot dog bun to a better alternative."
10201,32,5,1,5/27/2014,"If you like specialty hot dogs or just want a hotdog this is the place to come, with its variety ˜and fry dipping sauces you can't go wrong."
10202,32,5,1,5/20/2014,Can't beat the fries with aioli mayo. ˜Really good hot dogs too!
10203,32,5,1,5/12/2014,"One of my favorite spots in the city! Who knew a hotdog restaurant could make me come back over and over again? The owner said he wanted to provide a full meal with fresh ingredients at an affordable price and oh boy did he do that and more! All the ingredients he tops on the hot dogs are fresh and the buns are brought in fresh daily. ˜A full meal (hot dog, amazing fries and a drink) will cost you around $8. They have hot dog staples such as the Texas Tommy (chile, cheese, deliciousness) and the Chicago. The owner also has a special every month where he creates his own masterful combination, which turns out surprisingly well! One more plug, it is open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays! Have a late night craving? Go to Underdogs."
10204,32,4,1,4/20/2014,"I'm moving into Philly next month, and my knowing of Underdogs' existence ahead of this life change is dangerous. I can see it now: I'll be sitting in my new apartment, it'll be mid-summer, and suddenly the craving will strike: hot dog, wrapped in bacon and cheese, fried. A mere walking distance away. I feel like it will be extra hard to ignore the fact that Underdogs -- bright, colorful, alluring -- is in business when it's 2 a.m., the night is ending and hunger sets in. Because apparently they're open crazy late (4!) on weekends. Hot dogs might as well be one of my major food groups, and it's hard to screw them up. Underdogs does a fine job at concocting fun toppings to the traditional dog -- and for that, I'm happy. To note: Cash only. Incredibly cheap. Insanely fattening. In the best of ways."
10205,32,5,1,4/19/2014,"This was the single best hot dog of my entire life. ˜Before I finished it, I called my parents to rave about its deliciousness. ˜This was honestly the best decision I've ever made. ˜I am thinking about going back for a dinner hot dog."
10206,32,3,1,4/1/2014,"Have been here several times and kinda wish I got a card on the first visit, since I'm definitely on my way to trying everything. The dogs are tasty and the sausages themselves are each (more or less) unique to the creation for each menu item. I'm a fan of the ""Adonis"" and anything with the pepper hash (get the pepper hash). Their fries are delicious and I love the dipping sauces, but they do not portion out enough sauce for a serving of fries. Food is served relatively quickly, though the quality has varied on different visits. While I wouldn't go out of my way to visit the spot, when I'm in the neighborhood and I want to fill up for lunch on the relative cheap, this place is on my radar."
10207,32,4,1,3/31/2014,"We went to Underdogs late on a Friday night after attending a Flyers game. ˜This was exactly what we needed as a late night snack- hot, fresh dogs! The restaurant is a little hard to find because it is under street level, but once you get in there, there are plenty of seats and a huge menu of hot dog selections. ˜I decided to get a basic coney dog with mustard and sauerkraut, and my husband went for the odd combination of hot dogs with a fish cake. The hot dogs seemed like your basic/good quality and nothing special, but the toppings were all fresh, and they were grilled nice and crusty. ˜The buns were perfect- thick, flaky and delicious, and substantial enough to hold everything together. We each got a combo with fries and a drink. ˜Fries were nice and crispy and each came with a dipping sauce. ˜I had garlic aoli and LOVED it. ˜Combos went for about $6.50-$7.50 each, so I would recommend this place for a cheap meal. I wish they had one of these places near my house, because I could see myself stopping after every night on the town!"
10208,32,5,1,3/21/2014,"Great dogs and awesome fries. ˜If you eat your way through the menu you get your name on the wall and a card to get cheap combo meals. ˜The Michigan, Bufalo Gal and Seattle Grunge Dog are my go to favorites. ˜I usually get the Old Bay or Garlic dipping sauce for my fries. ˜Look for my name on the wall by the register, Bob Blunt."
10209,32,5,1,2/25/2014,"Famazing. The bun was the best part- I kept remarking to my friend on how flaky, buttery, and crispy it was. Oh, and the dawg itself was great."
10210,32,1,1,2/24/2014,"I really hope the owner reads these because it is embarrassing to complain in public. The hot dog bun was stale, I tried a second time and yes stale again- do you think we can't tell the difference if you toasted it? Bad idea to try to pass off stale buns by toasting them. Hot dogs were cold and not prepared the way it was supposed to be. The Texas says ""wrapped in bacon and fried"" however it was just regular and some rubbery bacon thrown in. I had a great Texas dog from a roadside truck on the way to Key West and boy was that good. Too bad this place ruined my craving."
10211,32,2,1,2/16/2014,"Went here with friends visiting from out of town for a quick lunch and had a mediocre meal. The toppings, which make this joint gourmet aren't all that special when the meat is sub par and cold. Also, the buns are terrible. They are too thick, dry and bready and the ratio of bun to meat is way off. I will say, the fries are fantastic and the menu is creative but the ideas are not executed well. I am sure this place is sufficient for the late night bar crowd, but we will be at 500 degrees instead. Fries to go please?"
10212,32,4,1,2/14/2014,"best selection of dogs. Great, funky atmosphere. Reminds me of Zippy's back home (only they do burgers). ˜They have gluten free buns, which is great! ˜fries are hand cut. And the sauces! Garlic aoli was to-die-for"
10213,32,5,1,2/9/2014,Great cheap place to get something different. 23 different dogs and great hand cut fries.
10214,32,5,1,2/7/2014,"great place for awesome dogs with a twist! more like an upscale dog shop, plus the fries and dipping sauces are excellent."
10215,32,4,1,2/7/2014,"I first tried Underdogs when they made an appearance and provided some of their specialties at a Yelp event. ˜From that point on, I schemed about going to the full restaurant. ˜After talking about it for several months, I went into the city specifically to go to Underdogs. ˜Took a 50-minute train ride for hot dogs. ˜But they're really so much more. ˜They're more of an adventure than just a hot dog. ˜You can go anywhere for a regular old hot dog, but these are huge, delicious hot dogs with such a creative array of toppings. ˜Prices are reasonable and the fries that accompany the hot dogs in the combo meal are great as well. I've tried four of their dogs so far and am determined to try them all so that I can get my name on the wall. ˜It's going to take me a while (23 hot dog flavors in total with regular specials to accompany those), but it's going to be awesome every bite of the way."
10216,32,5,1,2/4/2014,This place has a wide variety of hot dogs and fries....but know it's only hot dogs and fries. I had a peanut butter and jelly hot dog that was delicious! I'm told it used to be cash only but I think they take cards with a $7 minimum charge now (I paid with a card). The only drawback is there is this old wooden shelving unit next to the cash register that hold condiments and it looks really dirty. I hope this place is doing well enough that they can upgrade their shelf set up soon so no one has an excuse to not try this place!
10217,32,5,1,1/31/2014,I always walk by this place and wondered about it so I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I'm glad I did. I'm not much of a hot dog person because most places tend to make it too salty but not here. I had their vegetarian my thai and it was simply amazing. The peanut butter against the veggie sausage gave it a really good sweet and salty taste that wasn't too overpowering. The service was pretty good. The counter guy was friendly and was doing his job well. I would definitely come by here again
10218,32,1,1,1/31/2014,"I went for the first time yesterday, and got the lamb sausage combo with fries and a drink for lunch. ˜First and foremost, when I was waiting for my order I began to sincerely regret placing it. ˜The reason is the place is filthy, and if what you can see is dirty, imagine what the rest looks like. The fries were limp and oily- not crisp or crunchy on the outside at all, so they were disappointing. ˜The hot dog bun was just out of a bag, which was unappetizing. ˜And the sausage wasn't even warm. ˜Sausages have fat content, and cold fat is not delicious. ˜ Won't go again."
10219,32,3,1,1/23/2014,"I love hot dogs, but these were just ok. Nothing so inspiring as to make me want a fist on the wall. Plus, this is not the place I would opt to take kids since each dog is a bit pricey for the amount of food you get. Still, I appreciated the cool toppings, fresh ingredients. They know how to throw together a decent dog, which is a tough thing to come by in Philadelphia."
10220,32,4,1,1/11/2014,"This place puts a nice change on the classic American food item. They pair a hot dog or sausage with just about anything you can think of. I had the Peanut Butter and Jelly dog and it was surprisingly a good combo. There's lots of different variations to try and if you're a hot dog fan, you will not be disappointed."
10221,32,5,1,1/10/2014,"I absolutely love this place, it was my first time here. I'm so glad I found it on yelp and decided to try it out. The staff is so nice, helpful, and made me feel so welcomed. Now the Dogs...amazing! If you love or even like hotdogs this place is a must! So many options and you get so much food for such a great price. I definitely will be going back :-)"
10222,32,2,1,1/8/2014,"Not sure how to rate this. Have ordered delivery from and been to Underdogs several times before and while I've tried a few options I am ber obsessed with the Chicago dog and would have previously rated as a 4-5. Unfortunately, when I went in today, the person serving me went directly from taking my order/money to making my hot dog- no hand washing or gloves involved. I was a bit grossed out, but took the hot dog home for lunch anyways. Halfway through eating I came across a short thick piece of black and white hair that most resembled a dog's hair, that was less easy to ignore. Wound up throwing the rest away, which would have been more sad if my hot dog had not tasted like it had accidentally been replaced with a veggie dog. ˜Sad to lose my favorite red meat fix."

10225,32,1,1,1/7/2014,What happened to standards ? Bun was ice cold - not a Chicago dog in my book and so filthy as in a dump - this used to be my favorite dog joint in Philly but like Jim's has lost its standards - such a shame
10226,32,4,1,1/3/2014,"Huge array of hot dogs, and all delicious. ˜ The fries are plentiful and that perfect balance of squishy/crunchy. ˜Be sure to try their sauces--it's worth the extra 25 cents."
10227,32,2,1,12/27/2013,I was intoxicated when I ate here yet still found it nasty. The bread needs to be warmed up more and doesn't taste fresh. I guess they're pretty creative with the different dogs but quality was horrible.
10228,32,2,1,12/17/2013,"meh, overpriced hotdogs in a basement. Focus on making a good hot dog, not these fancy named silly ones. Also, this is a garden level/basement setting. Thus it lacked ambience"
8336,32,4,1,12/10/2013,"Glory glory!! Came in for some dogs after a late night. Walked in around 3AM and got the Texas Tommy, 9th streeter, the coney, and the pero caliente. The portions of the fries were huge and came with dipping sauces. The sodas, not so much. We got the garlic, curry, and wasabi. The garlic was my favorite! I will definitely be back when the drunken munchies take control~~~~~ I think I could even come here sober. :)"
8341,32,4,1,12/4/2013,"I've been to Underdogs a number of times over the last year (slowly trying to get a fist on the wall, by eating all of their menu) and have always enjoyed what I've ordered. The range of hot dog/sausage options + toppings is a huge plus. ˜Pretty much everything you could want on a hot dog or sausage is found somewhere on the menu. My personal favorites have been: Texas Tommy, My Thai, and The Tryp. ˜But, as I said earlier - I've enjoyed everything that I've ordered. My strategy when I go is to get two dogs, instead of a dog combo. ˜You might end up spending a little bit more, depending on which two dogs you get - but I'd rather get two specialty dogs/sausages than one with fries and a drink. That's just me, though. The service has always been very friendly and helpful. ˜(This is going to sound like a negative point, but it's not..) The interior has never been spotlessly clean. ˜Which, to some, might be a deterrant... but you are at a hot dog place in the basement of a Center City building. ˜To me, it adds to the kind of ""alternative"" or ""off the beaten path"" aspect of the whole thing. I plan on continuing my quest to get my fist on the wall. ˜And will enjoy many more hot dogs in the process."
10229,32,2,1,12/3/2013,"Meh. I had the michigan and the marakesh. The michigan was ok. Not bad, nothing special though. I was really looking forward to the marakesh... I love merguez sausage. Unfortunately, the sausage was extremely dry. The toppings on top were not Moroccan or Mediterranean... It was like a really bland salsa. Fries were good, as was the garlic aioli. All in all - nothing special. Would I go back? Maybe, if I really wanted a hot dog and was in the area. I would not go out of my way to eat there though."
10230,32,4,1,11/20/2013,"I really, really, really want to give Underdogs a five star review. I feel like my disappointment at dropping $8 (even though the food is delicious) is difficult for a hot dog, fries, and a can of coke. Granted, I am ALWAYS full when I leave and have yet to encounter a dog I didn't like. These aren't your typical street meat hot dogs. There is a ton of variety. My favorite is the Tryp. It is a turkey sausage with stuffing, gravy and cranberry relish. Another tasty treat was the California Dreamin' which is avocado, tomato, lemon mustard vinaigrette. I actually had the last one as a veggie dog with a gluten free bun. Definitely still delivered a scrumptious lunch. If you eat all 23 dogs on the menu you can put your name on the wall and become part of the Fist Club. I'm determined to get my name up there! Make sure you don't have your head in the clouds when walking down 17th street as it is an underground store front. You'll need to pay attention or you will walk on by!"
10231,32,3,1,11/14/2013,"Decent hotdog place. Nothing special, but they do have a lot of variety. Luckily, they accept credit cards now. Food Quality/Taste = 3 Stars Portion Size Given Price = 3 Stars Price = 3 Stars Experience with Staff = 3 Stars Decor = 2 Star (it's underground and its easy to hit your head on the overhead beam when coming down the steps)"
10232,32,4,1,11/6/2013,"I'm not a huge hot dog or sausage fan, but this place could change my mind. I had the TRYP (turkey sausage with stuffing) and it was great. I tried a bite of a few other dogs and they were equally tasty. You won't find your average dog here. Their prices are cheap and I like the atmosphere. Overall, a good choice for a quick meal."
10233,32,1,1,10/18/2013,"note that this review is from a vegan perspective... went there several times and enjoyed it because they offered vegetarian/vegan options. however on our last visit neither of the staffers seemed to understand the concept. (i asked about the dipping sauces and was told that all the mayo-based sauces were vegan. um?) i ordered my dogs and ate them. i went back to get a soda refill and saw fish sauce on the counter. i asked them what they used it in. it went in one of the ingredients that had just been on one of my ""vegan"" dogs. fish sauce is not vegan! this leads me to believe that some of the dogs i had in the past may not have been as vegan as i thought either. i'm very disappointed. if you're going to cater to an audience, you should be familiar with that audience's needs."
10234,32,2,1,9/28/2013,"I'll start by saying I love hotdogs. Growing up in the Lehigh Valley I've have my share of great chili cheese dogs from the likes of Yocco's, Pott's and Willy Joe's ˜I was hoping for my first great Philadelphia chili cheese dog from Underdogs, but unfortunately all I got was disappointment. Their chili dog was the Michigan, a standard dog with cheese, chili, onions and mustard. Criticism? ˜First, the Berks hotdog itself was nothing special to begin with was too big. I'm not even sure how it was cooked but it lacked any crispness that a flattop would provide. Secondly, the mound of onions and brown mustard zig-zags on ˜top made the dog not only awkward to eat but also overpowered any flavor the substandard meat provided. Finally, the toasted bun and melted cheddar over the dog made it even more difficult to eat and made it dry. Really who toasts a hotdog bun? You steam a hot dog bun. A bad attempt at an authentic Detroit Coney and one of the poorer examples of a chili cheese dogs I have had in Pennsylvania. Rather than try to elevate the hotdog to a meal, halve the size of the dog itself, don't toast it, put the mustard and onions under the dog and the chili on top and cut the price in half. If I'm ever in the area and need something to eat after the bars let out I might come here again and try the fries, otherwise it's a once and done kind of place."
10235,32,5,1,9/22/2013,"HOLY, HOLY FRACKING HOT DOG! Can I give this place 10stars!?!?! I was in Philly for a couple days and this place is one of the best finds in a long time! You can't go wrong with any of their dogs. ***TIP***Get the french fries with your dog. They are cut and soaked by Underdogs--home made! Who does that? Underdogs does! It's a very time consuming process that a majority of places won't do, but this place is about quality. The owner is so passionate about what he serves. I love this joint! It makes me want to give up sunny Cali for Philly just so I can go to Underdogs on a regular basis. Well done Underdogs! Well done!"
10236,32,4,1,9/18/2013,"I finally made it to Underdogs and I was really impressed. First, the guy behind the counter gave great customer service. He may have been the owner because he was proud of the dogs and really eager to see if you enjoyed them. I got the Hair of the Dog and was a little disappointed because I thought it was a hot dog but it was basically just an egg sandwich. It was a delicious egg sandwich but I had to have a dog. I followed that up with a California dog. The avocado and lemon was a great combo and even though it was a strong flavor, it didn't over power the dogs. Which brings me to my next topic, the dogs. They use Berks hot dogs which are really good, big and flavorful. I'm from Berks County so I was happy to see my hometown dog. We also got an order of fries with a dipping sauce. We asked for the vinegar sauce but they brought us an additional curry sauce to try as well. Both were delicious and the fries were fresh cut. I'm a big hot dog fan and would suggest Underdogs to any Hot Dog aficionados."
10237,32,5,1,9/12/2013,"Not only is this place for underdogs, it's underground. You could walk by it and almost this gem located on the lower level of the street. The food is sooo freaking good. My personal favorite is the Adonis--a lamb sausage, with tzaziki, and tomatoe and cucumber salad. Now you may think, ""cool, you just got a gyro in sausage form""--which is kinda true, but the lamb sausage is killerrrr. It's the perfect amount of spicy and has a really great flavor. All the sausages are locally bought and made, so it doesn't have that gamey flavor you sometimes get with ""un-fresh"" lamb. The best part about this place is that it's open super duper late. It's meant to be a drunk food, and when I went, I have never been so satisfied with my ""drunkchie"" food."
10238,32,4,1,9/10/2013,"Hot dogs here! Get your hot dogs! Gourmet hot dogs! And sausages! They should have someone outside hawking their food, because I never really knew this place was here until I was invited by a friend for lunch. We entered to find it crowded like a grown-up cafeteria - a line winding down the middle of the restaurant and people at almost every table. Luckily, my friend snagged two seats while I went up to order our food. I went with the Warsaw Packed (Czerw's smoked kielbasa with saut?ed onions and spicy mustard) and she got the Coney Classic (with sauerkraut and spicy mustard). We got our drinks and waited a bit for our food...were even brought the wrong food at one point...but in the end, we got our meals, complete with crispy, salty fries that complemented the dogs well. I was a big fan of the kielbasa - it was cooked to perfection and paired well with the spicy mustard. It's not a lunch I would eat everyday (oh, the calories!) but it's a great choice for the every now and then when craving real meat or even french fries. Their choices are creative and varied enough to have something for everyone. And their prices are just right! Lunch for less than $8 - $5 if you're getting your hot dog Han Solo. Can't beat that!"
10239,32,4,1,9/2/2013,"Food wise, Underdogs was everything I wanted it to be: Gourmet hotdogs and really good fries. I ordered the Texas Tommy, regular fries with garlic aioli dipping sauce. It was fantastic. A friend of mine ordered the Coney Classic, fries and wasabi aioli. She enjoyed her's just as much as I did mine. The atmosphere wasn't really what I was expecting. For me, a hotdog brings back memories of 4th of July BBQ's and classic Americana. Underdogs doesn't offer that feeling, but for a quick lunch, it's not bad. Overall, it's good, and I would recommend it to anyone. Especially those who want to try something different, and new, but don't want to be to crazy."
10240,32,5,1,8/28/2013,"Huge variety of delicious gourmet hot dogs to try. In addition to their huge variety of dogs, they also have gourmet cookies and probably the best fries I've hard. Highly recommended. It's also awesome that they're usually open until 4 AM on weekends."
10241,32,4,1,8/24/2013,My husband ate here recently and loved it. The hand cut fries are divine and come with loads of cool flavored mayo options. He got the equivalent of an Irish all-day breakfast on a bun (must be tried).
10242,32,5,1,8/17/2013,"Let me say this upfront: I am a vegetarian who really misses meat (I know, lots of veg people don't, but I do - sue me). Before coming here, I never, ever had a good veggie dog. Hamburgers, chicken - all that stuff I could find a decent approximation. But veggie dogs were always lacking for me. I can honestly say that the veggie dog from Underdogs has been a lifesaver for me. Any of the dogs can be made veggie, from what I understand. I'm partial to the original Underdog, but I also love the Penn Deutch (with pepper hash, which I so rarely get to enjoy) and the Coney Classic (can you see that I have a thing about cabbage?). The Chicago dog is also fantastic. My greatest love for this place comes from the fry sauces. The selection is vast and excellent. Most of the sauces are mayo-based, so if that's your thing, you'll enjoy these. I keep coming back here because this is the only place I've found that has FRY SAUCE. I got hooked on fry sauce when I lived briefly in Utah - and it's almost impossible to get elsewhere! I've tried making my own, but it never really turns out right. I love being able to get actual fry sauce whenever I want. It tastes like Utah, it really does. As long as the veggie dogs and fry sauce stick around, I will continue coming here."
10243,32,5,1,8/16/2013,"I eat only the veggie dogs, but they are the shit. I've had a few different options but I usually make my own dog jawn. The owner of the place is always courteous and helpful - he provides guidance if you look lost evaluating all your options. Anyway, haven't had a bad dog there. I suggest getting the combo since the fries are spot-on. To the people ragging on the buns, I take exception - I actually enjoy the buns. They are definitely a different bun, but I think they complement the dogs quite well."
10244,32,3,1,8/11/2013,"My boyfriend and I were coming home from a late movie and wanted to stop for a late night snack, and this place hit the spot. I got a Chicago dog with a vegan hotdog and he got the Brat. First of all, I was very impressed that a vegan dog was an option. It makes me really happy that it was. For us non-beef eaters, other hotdog alternatives are always exciting. Second, the price was very reasonable. This was a good snack for less than 15 dollars. People complain the bread is too bready, and I would also agree with that. The place is also not exactly the nicest or the cleanest, but I dont think you can expect it from a place you go to for a midnight snack. So, I wasn't floored with my experience, but it definitely wasn't bad. I could see myself going there again."
10245,32,4,1,8/10/2013,"I went to Underdogs the day it opened and many times since! I'm a huge fan of the special dogs they serve, specifically the Mac Daddy- fried Mac and cheese and broccoli with jalape?o sour cream. Delish I don't *love* the bread, it's just a bit too doughy for me. They give free refills if you ask and the sriracha mayo is fantastic. I think the combo (dog, drink and fries) is a good deal for about 8 bucks."
10246,32,5,1,7/30/2013,"I come here for a lunch that's not too big but totally satisfying. Plenty of awesome combinations for hot dogs and sausages made to cover whatever you're craving. Delicious seasonal specials keeps things fresh, but you'll quickly grow a list of favorite ones from the huge list on display. Tasty fresh fries with just as crazy a list of dipping sauces. Cool, friendly staff on deck has helped make this place a favorite of mine."
10247,32,3,1,7/6/2013,"Cash only, folks. Wish I had read other people's reviews more closely to catch that, to avoid having to use their onsite ATM. Extensive menu with lots of options for your hot dog and for aoili's to go with your fries. I got the Adonis, which is a lamb sausage that comes with the usual accompaniments. The sausage itself was perfectly cooked, tender, and flavorful. The bun really didn't help things any- quite generic in taste and texture. The fries were great, and they give a very generous portion of them. I got the curry mayo which was pretty good. My fountain soda tasted very dilute/more or less like club soda with a hint of root beer. ˜ The guy behind the counter, who I believe was the owner, was very helpful and enthusiastic about their offerings."
10248,32,5,1,6/27/2013,"I moved to Philly a few months ago, and this is by far one of my favorite places to eat at.-- enough said. If you're a local and you aren't doing the ""Wall of Fame"" challenge, you are stupid. I LOVE YOU, UNDERDOGS!"
10249,32,5,1,6/25/2013,"There are dozens of combinations of hot dogs you can get here. Spicy, Mediterranean, mexican, texan, I can't even remember the types. I just remember having a full stomach and delicious experience--for less than $10!"
10250,32,4,1,6/22/2013,I really like this place. The fires are awesome and both dogs I've tried have been fantastic!
6578,32,3,1,6/18/2013,"Pretty good hotdogs. ˜There is no way it compares to Texas Weiners on Snyder, but a great option at 3 am when you are about to end your night. ˜I ordered a Chicago and Michigan dog. ˜Both were good, though I prefered the Michigan (chili cheese dog). ˜The fries were okay, we tried them with the Thai peanut sauce. ˜ I would absolutely like to try each of their 23 hotdogs, and not just to get my name on the wall."
10251,32,4,1,4/18/2013,"Definitely a great place, something for everyone. I wouldn't be able to tell you my favorite dog yet, as I've only gotten through half their menu. I like that there is a veggie dog option and a gluten free bun option. The buns in general though, are just terrible. They're just too dry! But the fries are great - thin and crispy. There's almost as many options for dipping sauces as there are hotdogs. Love that this becomes a BYOB in the later hours. The staff has always been great and the bathrooms are always clean. I'll be coming back here even after my fist and name is painted on the wall."
10252,32,4,1,4/15/2013,"The weather was so glorious this weekend, with the sun brightly shining, that it made me want to feel like it was summer already in any and all ways possible, and extending the summer feeling to food just seemed natural. We were both starving - he from doing work on his laptop all afternoon and I from 6 hours of yoga training - so we didn't want to wait for food. I remembered our friends had enjoyed Underdogs when they first tried them last year, and since we still hadn't followed through on our promise to check them out my suggestion became our dinner choice on Sunday. They're a cash-only establishment...unless you order ahead online, THEN you can pay by card. We placed our order, walked over, picked it up and walked over to the crowded Rittenhouse Square Park to enjoy the remainder of the lovely weekend weather with our ""dogs."" They primarily offer beef hot dogs, but they also have a nice selection of sausages, which is perfect for me (I'm not partial to hot dogs...ever, really). I was tempted by the Marrakech given the Yelp reviews, but went instead with the Adonis (lamb sausage with lettuce, tomato, onion and tzatziki) that had first caught my eye (and stomach). My fianc? got the Chihuahua chorizo sausage with saut?ed onions, chipotle mayo and queso blanco and the My Thai (beef hot dog with spicy peanut sauce and green papaya slaw) combo, with fries and garlic aioli. The rolls they came in were not your supermarket find; large and NOT super soft, they're closer to what you might get as a hoagie roll (or at least that's what my fianc? said). My lamb sausage was split in half to fit into the roll with its toppings, and it was deliciously lightly spiced, and its warmth against the cool tzatziki sauce was super YUM. I got a taste of the My Thai, whose peanut sauce contrasted nicely with the Asian slaw on top, but I didn't get a chance to try the Chihuahua because that disappeared too fast! (I guess that means its good...) The fries are pretty good, but the aioli is only ok IMHO - hard to compare to Monk's fries and aioli, once you've tried them nothing else tastes good. But hey, the prices aren't too bad, although there are always people who feel paying more than $1 for a hot dog is stupid (I know a few). We'll have to compare the other specialty hot dog places to see which is the TOP DOG (oh, haha, I'm so funny (thanks Dad for your sense of humor))."
10253,32,3,1,4/9/2013,"This basement space off of 17th street is A-OK, but nothing that knocked my socks off. ˜The staff was kind of short with my boyfriend and I, even though they weren't busy: there was only one other couple sitting at a table. ˜ I got the Chihuahua and my boyfriend got the Texas Tommy; we both agreed mine was better. ˜The chihuahua is a chorizo style sausage covered with white queso and peppers. ˜It was tasty, although it really bothered me that the dogs were both kind of luke warm-- I thought its called a ""hot"" dog for a reason? ˜Unlike many reviewers before me, I didn't have a problem with the bun (maybe they changed their vendor?). ˜It complemented the dog without overwhelming. ˜The best aspect of the meal were the crispy fries, which we got a mountain of. ˜The garlic aioli dipping sauce was good, but strangely cold... I think Underdogs would make great drunk food, or a good snack when I have an insatiable hankering for a hot dog, but otherwise, it's just another average, somewhat-overpriced fast food joint in Center City. One big no-no: the bathroom is nasty. ˜Like a gas station. ˜Poorly maintained and no paper towels. ˜You've been warned."
10254,32,3,1,4/2/2013,"3.5 Stars. It's amazing how hot dogs have moved up in the world in recent years, jumping from sidewalk stands into their own gourmet shops. Underdogs is one of those landing spots, which is worth a stop...or even 23! Yep, with 23 different types of dogs and sausages, you may need to take your time deciding what to order from a wide variety of combinations. I went with ""The Michigan"" combo: a chili dog with cheddar, mustard and onions with fries and a soda. For only $7.00, I thought it was a good value. Although I'm not a huge fry fan in general, their bagged variety were pretty decent. However, the dog wasn't the best I've ever eaten. Good, but not great. Of course, they have 22 ways to make it up to me, so I'll probably give them another chance, even if I never get my name on the wall for defeating every one."
6896,32,4,1,3/29/2013,"Love this place. Great late night or weekend afternoon spot for a hot dog. The bread is a little thick for a hot dog, but the options are really unique. My fiance and I tired to eat every hot dog and get our names up on the wall. It was a fun journey, we have four left."
10255,32,3,1,3/14/2013,"Went to Underdogs for a quick lunch. Had the Warsaw, a lovely locally made smoked kielbasa served with caramelized onions and a spicy brown mustard. Very nice char on the kielbasa and the smoke really came through as well. The mustard was not overpowering. While a bit messy to eat, the sandwich did not suffer from the too much bread syndrome. Recommended. ˜Looking forward to trying other non hot dog hot dogs here."
10256,32,3,1,3/12/2013,"I don't know how I have lived in Philly for 2 years and never came to Underdog before this week...really, I literally don't! I've walked by so many times but never ventured in until last Saturday night around 1am. ˜I was craving some late night pizza and some one recommended Underdog instead. I got The Adonis which is the lamb hotdog and it was ridiculously delicious from what I remember (but maybe everything tastes ridiculously delicious at 1am when you're drunk). Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I will definitely go back. I took a star off because they're cash only and I hate that. But not to worry, there's an ATM on site of course! I'm just sayin' I dont like when places don't want to pay credit card fees but they want their customers to pay them an ATM fee. Who carries cash anymore?"
10257,32,4,1,3/11/2013,"Sometimes a girl just needs a hotdog. ˜ Tired of the endless salads that often come at lunch time, Underdogs has earned a spot in my lunch rotation. ˜The dogs are decent and offer fun toppings that can take you from Thailand to Greece with their ingredients. ˜Sir Mixalot may beg,""Don't lose those buns hun"" but I beg to differ. ˜I think they overpower the dog, even with all the fixins. ˜A minor complaint and certainly not something that keeps me away. I base 80% on my decision to dine here based on their fries and while they pretty much consume my caloric allowance, I don't really care. ˜They are my favorite version of fried potatoes: skin on, perfectly salted, and come with an aioli of your choosing. ˜A combo will cost you less than $8, which in these parts, is a good deal. ˜Plus there is always enough fries to share."
10258,32,3,1,3/10/2013,"Underdogs is half a block from work and is a pretty popular lunch spot with my co-workers. I'd have to say that I've enjoyed the hotdogs I've gotten there, myself, though I'd say it's wildly overpriced. I think I dropped almost $8ish on a dog, some fries, and a canned soda. There were some cool toppings on it, and it did taste great, but something about any hotdog costing that much seems ridic. I did get a dog that was actually a lamb sausage, but even the standard dogs weren't that much cheaper than mine. That brings me to the food itself - I got the Marrakesh which is a lamb sausage with a bit of mediterranean salad on it. I thought it was pretty delicious. The fries are ˜pretty standard, but the array of dipping sauces to choose from to come with the fries are really what make the fries come to life. Overall, if money is no object, Underdogs has some pretty great hotdogs. Get it to go, though. The tiny little location is situated down a flight of stairs from ground level and it can get a bit overwhelming when it's packed for lunch. Service is pretty fast, so you won't be waiting around long."
10259,32,4,1,3/10/2013,"Been here 3 times and had three different dogs: the smoker, a nice smoky sausage from Czerw's in Port Richmond; Pero Caliente, a spicy sausage with a chocolate mole and jalape?o; and damn I must have Alzheimer's because I can't remember the third right now. Let me just say they were all pretty good, not blow your socks off, but good. Smoker was easily the best but that's just my own preference. Fries are solid too. Definitely a good joint to grab lunch downtown if looking for cheap (relatively) and a sure upgrade from cart dogs. Try it...you will find something you like on their menu."
10260,32,3,1,3/6/2013,"Every now and then you just want a hot dog, you know? Even better, with a lot of random gross crap on it. I am a fan indeed. OooOo and with greasy fries (word of advice, don't get the ""horseradish mustard"" dipping sauce...it's just spicy brown mustard). Just one request: FIND A NEW BUN VENDOR. I just can't get behind those buns..."
10261,32,4,1,2/27/2013,"Great hot dogs, weird bread- almost tastes stale and waaay too thick/dense. ˜Manhattan can use some help with their simmered onions- not tangy like I'm used to from NYC street carts. ˜Fries are good and sauces are yummy but only give you a very small amount of sauce on the side."
10262,32,4,1,2/25/2013,"Very close to our hotel, and after living in NYC, for 1.5 yrs, we're a bit picky about our dogs. ˜I opted for the Texas Tommy, and it was sinfully good. ˜The fries are fantastic! ˜I can't give it 5 stars as my heart belongs to Crif Dogs in the East Village, but tasty for ""upscale street food."" ˜The gal behind the counter was sweet."
10263,32,3,1,2/20/2013,Had heard alot about this place and decided to visit. Had the Chicago Dog. Was not impressed at all. It was very mediocre. The bun was cold and was missing the poppy seeds. They also forgot to put the Hot green chillies on mine. Place is nothing special. Its cool and a bit different at the most. Cool thing is that its open pretty late if you are trying to get a bite to eat on the weekend.
10264,32,2,1,1/27/2013,Went here to see what a Philly hot dog place would be like. It is kind of small and in the basement of the building. It is a little dingy inside and seemed old. I ordered the chicago dog and I wasn't really impressed. The rolls are very thick and it did not have poppy seeds on it. A proper chicago dog would without a doubt have that.
10265,32,4,1,1/20/2013,What's better than getting a chili cheese dog @ 1 am on a Saturday night? Well...not much! Great experience at Underdogs this weekend. Service was quick. Fries were amazing! Got the chipotle mayo and utah fry sauce (kinda like a sriracha mayo) for dipping. Signed up for the Underdogs challenge. Time to get my name up on that wall! Will post my favorite sausage & hotdog at the end
10266,32,3,1,1/5/2013,"Hmmmmmmmm. I really want to like this place and I do for the most part, I just won't be jumping at the need to get back here as soon as possible. I had the pleasure of first trying Underdogs at a Yelp event last year and was really impressed. By the time I had gotten to my Coney Classic, it was cold but still delicious and that sparked my interest. So I finally got a chance to check this place out and....it okay. Not amazing, but okay. 1. The hot dog is extremely filling. I got the Texas Tommy Combo to go and couldn't finish it all in one sitting. The hot dog was thick and the bun was soft with a crusty crust. It was wrapped in bacon and smothered with cheese. I could feel the calories hitting my hips in every bite. Overall tasty but nothing that blew me out of the water. 2. The speed is quick. Took me about 15 minutes to order and get my food. 3. But....my fries were lukewarm. I had a to go box or else I would have asked for newer fries if I was eating in. The fries were tasty but the fact that they were lukewarm just 3 minutes after getting the box was very disappointing. Basically that means they had been sitting out for a minute. 4. The lady at the counter was both handling money, filling up drinks, and serving the food- all without gloves. Gross. I was particularly put off when I saw that she was cleaning the tables with a rag and spray and saw my order was up. I looked at her, she looked over at the kitchen and saw my order. She went right over and put my food in the box. No washing of hands or anything...... That's a big no no. But I was really hungry and in a rush so I grabbed my food and went. But thinking about it again....I don't know if I would so readily come back to this one because of that."
8380,32,4,1,12/26/2012,"A+ for The Marrakesh! A good place to grab a cheap, fast, and delicious bite in the Rittenhou$e neighborhood. ˜The huge menu definitely has something for everyone. ˜I'll be back to try out the other combos! Bonus star for staying open til 4AM during the wknd!"
10267,32,4,1,12/18/2012,"Eat one of every hot dog on the menu to earn a fist on the wall with my name on it?! Challenge Accepted! Wait, I don't need to do it in one sitting? Well, that's gonna make it easier! I was first introduced to Underdogs at a Yelp! event and made a mental note to return. ˜Maybe they put something in the samples I had, the Georgia Bulldog and Coney Classic, that help keep the tastes alive in my mind. ˜For whatever reason, it took me forever to return... until I realized they were open to 4AM on the weekends! ˜Victory is mine. ˜I confirmed my opinion on the Coney and branched out to lamb with The Adonis. ˜Both hit the spot, but I still give the edge to the Coney. ˜Now, I only have 21 more dogs to cross off the list..."
10268,32,4,1,12/17/2012,"I ordered 2 different veggie dogs and fries tonight, and they were all great and delivered in 15 min."
10269,32,2,1,12/7/2012,"I'm not happy about this update because until now, I've had nothing but a good experience at Underdogs. I went back about a week and a half and got eh 9th Streeter and it seems like the quality of their products have dwindled from great to meh. The dog was topped with minimal onions and peppers (more onions that peppers but again, minimal...maybe a a teaspoons worth), the bun was stale and the fries tasted like they had been in an open bag in the freezer for days. I had a few bites but ended up throwing most of my meal out. It's a shame because this place isn't on the cheap side, I expect value for my money."
8358,32,4,1,11/30/2012,"There seems to be a recent blossoming of many different gourmet hot dog places in the city, all of which offer a vegi dog (a nice alternative for a veg head like me). ˜I wandered into Underdogs rather late one Friday night (well after 11) ˜- definitely appreciate their late night hours. It was pretty empty, and we found the seating to be clean and easy. ˜The selection of available hot dogs is many, and they all seem really creative. I tried the thai dog, and it was pretty fantastic. I loved it! I would definitely go back and try more - especially since they are so inexpensive, very filling, and rather well flavored!"
10270,32,4,1,11/28/2012,"When I heard about this 'haute' dog joint near work, I knew I had to check it out. Since then, I've been back three times. So when the GF's brother and cousin came to visit from Michigan, where did we decide to go on our first night? Underdogs of course! If you're heading south on 17th street, look to your right and a bit down, and you'll see the 'under'ground steps to Underdogs. Almost makes you feel like you're in the know. There's an ATM right outside - and for good reason. Unfortunately, Underdogs is a cash only joint - surprising, as orders can easily total over $20 if you go with a friend. Apparently they do BYOB after 5PM though, so there is some satisfaction there - for others perhaps. In any case, on to the onslaught of haute dogs! Chihuaha ($4.50 / $7.75 with small soda and fries) Chorizo sausage with saut?ed onions, chipotle mayo and queso blanco This dog had a slight bit of heat to it - the chorizo definitely came through. This was nicely balanced by the queso blanco cheese topping the dog as well as the chipotle mayo, which added a nice creaminess to the dog. Definitely one of my favorites. The ""buns"" that these dogs come on are pretty hefty - more of a roll. Once you get through about three of these - you feel that wear and tear on your jaw - but it's totally worth it. There are no soggy buns here. Chicago Style ($3.75 / $7.00 with small soda and fries) Yellow mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, sport peppers, dill pickle spear and celery salt If the Chihuaha dog was more savory - this was definitely more fresh and even sweet. The fresh tomato slices and dill pickle definitely brought Chicago to light - cool, fresh, and bright. The sport pepper added a spicy kick and was nicely accentuated by the celery salt and chopped onions. No ketchup needed or wanted here! The Michigan ($3.75 / $7.00 with small soda and fries) Beef chili, cheddar, chopped onions and mustard The Michigan dog was ordered by both the GF and her brother. I sampled a few bites of her dog (not the first time this has happened!) and declared it a hit. The chili was of the creamy variety and it had a small kick to it. The chopped onions were a nice foil to all that savoriness. The hot dog itself was plump and juicy. A solid dog. The fries? Let me tell you - they do not disappoint. They are not necessarily the most crispy of fries, but are well seasoned (a tad over-seasoned with salt) and delicious. An order of small fries or a combo nets you one of there different dipping sauces - I typically go with the garlic aioli or the chipotle mayo - perfect complements to greasy, delicious fries. If you order a side order of large fries - be prepared for a massive dose of fries and two complimentary complements to your fries. My only other gripe (the first being the fact that Underdogs is cash only) is that the sodas that accompany any combo are not only ridiculously small - they are filled with 75% ice. Knowing this - on this visit, I clearly asked for no ice in my soda (it was also freezing outside). Lo and behold however, ice packed my cup. It was not a big enough deal to ask for another soda, so I took a sip of it. One sip and it was done (ok ok, maybe two sips). Other than this pet peeve of mine (really? who needs that much ice?), Underdogs is a great place to go for a quick, tasty bite in the Rittenhouse area. If you're closer to South Street however - I hear Hot Diggity is great as well. I'll need to do a taste test between the two haute dog joints one of these days. In the meantime, Underdogs gets it done for me."
10271,32,4,1,11/20/2012,"One of my coworkers recommended it to me and after being used to the $6+ lunches in the area, I gladly gave it a shot. I got the California Dreaming - big hot dog, great bun, lots of avocado onions vinaigrette, etc. For less than $5 I couldn't complain. The ambience could be better, but then again, it's a hot dog place. I'll definitely be coming back."
10272,32,5,1,11/19/2012,"We used Underdogs for our Wedding Celebration catering and we would highly recommend them to anyone that is looking for a fun and casual catering option. Robert (the owner) was a class act from the very beginning. ˜He gave us plenty of options and explained his no-frills approach. ˜We got sides of Mac + Cheese and Pepper Hash with our 86 dogs (of 8 different varieties, all with vegetarian options) made by the Underdogs crew, since their fries do not travel well, self-admitted by Robert. Delivery was timely and flawless. ˜The dogs are cut in half to offer more variety for you guests. ˜The mac and cheese was one of the most talked about side dishes. ˜Of the hot dogs that we chose, the Buffalo Gal was far and away my favorite. 2 words to describe Underdogs catering: ˜Affordable and Awesome!"
7315,32,3,1,11/16/2012,"These kind of quick grab places are always tough to review. ˜It's just a hot dog, really. Are the dogs themselves anything special? ˜No. Are the topping options awesome? ˜Yes. Will I come here again? ˜Probably.

10273,32,3,1,11/14/2012,"Don't get me wrong, I love a good wiener. It's sick actually. Like, the essentials in my fridge ""sharp white cheddar cheese, ketchup and hot dogs"" instead of the standard ""eggs, milk, and bread."" ˜The best part about this place is the variety of dogs you can get-- including vegan hotdogs and actual sausages. The best ""hot dog"" I ordered was the Marrakesh which was a lamb sausage and pretty tasty but could have been spicier. ˜Everything overall is pretty solid and the fries almost *almost* stole the show. But my take here is that not all dogs come out winners... Just as it is in life-- so depending on what you order you could give this place 5 stars or 2 stars... They should probably tweak their menu on the dogs that are sort of underwhelming to make them their own super stars."
10274,32,2,1,11/12/2012,"I had a really disappointing experience at Underdogs tonight. I have been wanting to go to this place since it opened and was expecting to love it! I can't help but compare it to Hot Diggity, and Underdogs didn't even come close for me. I had the Chicago style dog with fries and garlic aioli dipping sauce. The hot dog was lukewarm -- I noticed that it was done and on the counter long before the fries were ready, so I'm not sure if it was cold because it was sitting out or because it was never that hot to begin with. The worst part for me was the bun. I thought it was way too dense and bread-like, but that might just be personal preference. I did enjoy the toppings, and the fries and dipping sauce were good -- the fries were crispy and came out nice and hot. The cashier gave me a two dollar bill for change because they were running low on ones. I can't help but be annoyed by that! (But honestly, who paid them with a two dollar bill?!!)"
10275,32,4,1,11/10/2012,Tried the Chihuha Dog and the Thai Dog last night..both were very fresh and tasty...the Chihuha was a little more fancy and rich with chipotle mayo and some queso fresco cheese on top while the thai one was more on the simple side with peanut sauce and papaya salad..both served on a yummy bun...They were also kind enough to substitute the chorizo dog on chihuha for a lamb sausage...great fries too !!!
10276,32,3,1,11/4/2012,"The Philly equivalent of Crif Dogs in NYC (it's even a little underground like Crif Dogs!!). ˜I had the My Thai dog which was pretty good, but I didn't find it as tasty as Crif Dogs (Sorry!). ˜What I DID love was that this place is open till 4am Fri/Sat. ˜Philly desperately needs more late night eats and Underdogs provides."

While I love that other fancy hot dog place too, I like the veggie dogs at Underdogs a tad bit more. Toppings overfloweth, though, so get ready for a good portion of the food to be in the carrying container thingy. The fists on the wall have done a great job of encouraging me (and others, I presume) to try different dogs. And they're not too expensive either. Lose one star for no Level Up but regain it for that pervy fist logo. Underdogs boss people - start using Level Up!"
7249,32,4,1,9/30/2012,I've had the Texas tommy and the chili dog ( whatever it's called on the menu). Great dogs cheap prices. They're open late as well. I stop here all the time on my walk back to the train.
10281,32,4,1,9/26/2012,"Popped in for a late lunch/earl dinner and decided to try the 'Smoker' and the 'My Thai'. ˜First, presentation. ˜Walked up to the counter and was met by a friendly lady. ˜She took my order, made a suggestion and took my cash with no problems at all. ˜The store was empty, but it has a nice feel to it. ˜It's not a first date kind of place, but definitely a ˜third date. ˜The dogs were made quickly, although I was a little squicked out by the counter nibbling out of a large stainless bowl. ˜No idea, it could just be her lunch.

On arrival to my office, I popped the box down and opened it up. ˜Two tasty looking morsels stared up at me. ˜I tore into The Smoker first, as the lady at the counter said that it was the spicy one. ˜While it did have some heat, at no point was I wishing for water or bread. ˜Darned good flavor. ˜If I had one complaint, it would be the bun was not warm, so it was a little stiff. ˜Other than that, tasted great, was gone quickly. ˜Make sure you grab an extra napkin. ˜The toppings do tend to slide. The My Thai was next. ˜Same complaint about the bun, but the overall flavor was terrific. ˜I would have never thought of putting peanut sauce on a dog, but it really worked. Overall, I'm happy."
10282,32,5,1,9/24/2012,"I appreciate Underdogs' quality and creative options. My Marrakesh dog's merguez sausage had a great snap with excellent spicing, and was complimented nicely by the creamy, piquant harissa mayo and refreshing Meditteranean salad. The fries here are among the best I've tasted. Crispy, golden brown, and fluffy on the inside. They come with a free dipping sauce, and the chipotle mayo I chose to complement the fries did not disappoint, although next time I go I'll be sure to try the malt vinegar aioli. I'd rate Underdogs 4-stars solely on culinary merit but they get an extra star for an extremely friendly, patient staff. They handle the Rittenhouse drunk crowds probably better than any other establishment I've seen. Prices are reasonable to boot. Thus Underdogs works well for late night munchies or when the mood for quality sausage strikes."
10283,32,4,1,9/16/2012,"It's ""just a hot dog place"" but it's good. Nice staff, decent food, and the prices are reasonable. I wouldn't go for a full meal if you're worried about price - skip the fries and drink if that's the case, because they're extremely overpriced. Though fries and sodas always are. I've only had one type of hot dog here so far, but I enjoyed it and would definitely come back to get another (or even a different kind)."
10284,32,3,1,9/15/2012,"Had three sausage dogs here. The sausage themselves were pretty good. I was a little annoyed with the bread though as it seemed somewhat stale. Fries were really, really good. The garlic sauce gave it a great touch. Service was great. This place is open till 4am and is bob after 5pm. Works as that perfect after hours munchies place."
10285,32,5,1,9/9/2012,All their various hotdogs have a vegetarian counterpart. Inclusive and delicious.
10286,32,2,1,9/5/2012,"Let's start off with he positive. The fries are really good. The hot dog itself is decent. ˜However, the bread is blah and they screwed up 2 of the 4 hotdogs we ordered. I ordered a brat and they gave me a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. The other one was completely wrong. It was smothered with cole slaw and some weird sauce. I did not care for that one at all. Don't think it is worth giving it another shot."
10287,32,3,1,8/26/2012,"I really want to love this place, but I can only say it's OK. I've tried about 5 different hot dogs here, and none has blown me away. The only one I really enjoy is the Michigan dog. I'm from Michigan, and they actually do that one really well. The other ones I've tried seem dry or lack flavor. And I've been here when stale bread was served to me. The fries are decent, and it's nice that they offer free flavored dipping sauces to supplement the ketchup & mustard."
10288,32,3,1,8/21/2012,"Not too bad. But sadly, Underdogs was rather... underwhelming. On my way back from a trip to Reading Terminal Market with two of my friends (who half near drove me to bankruptcy while at RTM), we decided to grab an early dinner and head back to my place. We found ourselves at 16th street and were in the mood for something fast-foodish, so it came down to either Underdogs or Shake Shack, of which both were remaining to be checked off in my books. Since 17th was right around the corner and we were already dead tired, we decided to hit up Underdogs and leave Shake Shack for another day. This is, as other reviewers have mentioned, one of those small, hole-in-the-wall types of places, but has its own charm to it. Decor mainly consists of anarchist-looking paper fists for those intrepid warriors who have downed 23 of their dogs (doesn't have to be in the same sitting). After asking for recommendations (vegan dogs, of course), I was steered towards the California Dreamin' and My Thai dogs. In my opinion, they really weren't THAT mind-blowingly-awesome as some other reviewers have mentioned. The rolls were not that great, but the vegan dog itself wasn't bad. The Thai peanut sauce was too sweet for the overall composition of the dog, and the papaya just added a funky texture and taste. On the other hand, the veggies on the California Dreamin' (onions, avocado, tomatoes) were fresh and nice. All in all, they were okay, but definitely not worth the 10$ that I shelled out. On that note, this place is cash only, so keep that in mind! Tip: Where's the ultimate vegan dog in the US (in my opinion)? Try Spike's Junkyard Dogs up in the Boston area (spikesjunkyarddogs.com). Really good stuff!"
10289,32,5,1,8/19/2012,"I'm a sucker for a hole in the wall, especially when that hole is brightly painted and is staffed by some quality employees. ˜Underdogs simply oozes ""cool"", and I got the feeling that it was a little bit of a cash-only hipster paradise. Admittedly, I've only been once, but I get the feeling I'll be back at least 22 times. Why? Well, if you try all 23 of their dogs/sausages, you not only are chock-full of delicious meaty goodness, but you get your name painted on a FIST on their wall. ˜I know that doesn't sound like much, but I love a challenge and will be toting my menu everywhere I go in case the urge hits for some sausage or a dog. This first trip, I went in for the highly recommended Chihuahua: chorizo sausage with saut?ed onions, chipotle mayo and queso blanco. I figured ""YOLO"" and made it a combo for a few bucks more in order to get those tasty looking fries. ˜Before I get distracted talking about the sausage, let's just talk about the fries. Natural (I love when you get to see and nibble some potato skin) and well-salted (though, I imagine if you weren't part-deer like me, you may consider them over-salted), they were the best fries I've had in recent history. All different shapes and sizes, they were even tastier dipped in the chipotle mayo (you get one dipping sauce fo' free, and it's like, 50 cents for another). The amount of fries you get as the side in the combo was unreal (as in large) and I was totally stuffed after wolfing the whole order. The Chihuahua itself left me aching for more chorizo sausages in my life. It was fully loaded without overflowing, making it the ideal size for an indulgent lunch. The bun was miles above your average hot dog bun, with an actual doughy flavor that I loved. The sausage held it's own despite the rich toppings. The onions were perfectly sauteed and, though the queso blanco didn't add a ton to the party, the chipotle mayo was a match made in heaven to the sausage. I took mine to go (and went straight to Barnes & Noble to read an entire book cover to cover, ah funemployment) and the combo came in the most adorable (and practical) little box, which kept everything neat and tidy. I am already looking forward to trying the Tryp (smoked turkey sausage with stuffing, gravy and cranberry relish) and the 9th Streeter (Fiorella's spicy Italian with saut?ed peppers and onions). And the other 20. I'll be back (again, and again, and again. With friends.)"
10290,32,2,1,8/19/2012,"The issue is that Underdogs goes overboard While underwhelming My hot dog love only extends so far, and Underdogs just stretches the limit past the breaking point for me. Their dogs, while less expensive than others in the city, also have a lack of attention to detail that is incredibly frustrating. I get it, they're 'just hot dogs,' but if I wanted that I would go to the cart outside my work, drop $2 on two dogs and call it a lunch. The reason you go here is because you still want a dog but want a little more out of your lunch. My issue with Underdogs isn't the location or price, or even the service which has always been friendly. It's that without fail, every time I order a dog there is something discernibly wrong about it. Last time I got the California Dreamin and the Adonis. The California includes avocado, which wasn't sliced but rather seemed to be heavily ladled on top in a soupy mess that soaked through the roll and combined with the lemon mustard vinaigrette in a fairly stomach churning mixture. The Adonis had the same sauce problem, in that the overabundance of tzatziki was watery and turned everything into a big mess. I've had other dogs there with similar problems. The Georgia Bulldog and Special come with enough pepper hash to nearly cover the entire hot dog. Including the bun. My advice with Underdogs is to use caution with anything that has a sauce, and ask questions if you're not sure. Underdogs has been a series of 'man I wish I had known that before ordering' experiences for me. Had I known the avocado would arrive in liquid form I would have shied away. Same for the sauce on the Adonis. Or the hash on almost anything. Sometimes too much isn't a good thing. The good: it's the least expensive of the upscale hot dogs, and is easy to get to from anywhere in Center City. Their takeout boxes are great when getting more than one dog, and despite being cash only they do have an ATM right inside the door."
10291,32,4,1,8/6/2012,Great variety of hotdog sandwiches with yummy toppings and sides. Great stop for an after party bite.
10292,32,4,1,7/31/2012,"I am lovin' the hot dog fad in Philly! I stopped in at Underdogs for a California Dreamin' dog because I figured it was the one that would cause the least harm to my insides. This was my major mistake because to really enjoy a hot dog, you've got to have some savory, spicy, cheesiness, right? My dog was a bit too light and girly, which I should have expected, but I will surely be back to try something more intense. Maybe I will surprise everyone and get the bacon-wrapped and deep fried dog. Yeah, that'll show my arteries who's boss!"
10293,32,5,1,7/27/2012,"Absolutely LOVE this place! It's a hidden GEM right in the heart of Rittenhouse...if it wasn't for an article I read in a magazine, I wouldn't have even known this place existed! HUGE selection of hotdogs, very unique pairings that make you go, ""welllll I don't knnnoowww about that"" but then BOOM, it's delicious!! Their rolls are great too, not your standard hotdog bun you buy at Acme. The fries are quite tasty! Reminds me of Five Guys french fries. If you're as big a hotdog fan as I am, you will not be dissappointed by this place! TIP: take their menu and have each one you eat stamped...once you try them all, you'r name gets painted up on their wall of fame (although my girlfriend feels it's a wall of shame)...my ultimate short term goal in life!"
10294,32,4,1,7/27/2012,"I stopped in here for a quick dinner after work yesterday, and it was pretty good! This was my first vegan hot dog, and it was definitely not the faux-meat taste some vegan hamburgers and sausages can have. I chose a California Dreamin-there was plenty of avocado and it was good, but I think I'll go spicier next time. If you have any sort of allergy or food restriction, Underdogs was super accommodating which I really appreciate. Make sure to get the combo here-the fries are super salty and it's a huge portion for the extra $2/3."
10295,32,4,1,7/26/2012,I've only had their Texas Tommy and the Warsaw Packed. I do like the fries and they give you a TON of greasy fries in a bag plus a variety of sauces. I definitely want to come back here and try all the dogs on their menu.
10296,32,5,1,7/25/2012,"Oh, Underdogs. Where have you been all my life? This place is a little hidden treasure. I am a big fan of hot dogs and didn't have big expectations when I first went to try out their vast selections of crafty dogs. The menu is a bit overwhelming. It took me longer than I thought to decide the first time! My favorite is The Chihuahua...chorizo dog with spicy mayo and cheese? Um, YES! The fries are delicious. They are the closest thing to In & Out's fries that I've found in awhile. And they have a great variety of dipping sauces...my favorite are the spicy mayo and the malt vinegar aioli. Delish!!! The employees are always really cool. The girl I usually see behind the counter is super friendly. Price wise, it's a good place for a cheap lunch/dinner. Hot dogs range from $3-4 and you can get a combo for about $6. BYOB after five pm! Expect to leave this place with a massive food baby."
10297,32,5,1,7/19/2012,"I have never returned to a fast food place so many times as Underdogs. They quite simply make delicious quality food that is served quickly by the most friendly staff I've ever seen. The prices aren't too steep either for what you get... $3 to $4 for some delicious, crafty hot dogs on burly buns. If you have room for fries, get them too! They are fresh and tasty and go well with one of the dozen dips. Not all items are the standard beef hot dogs. All items live up to their name such as the Warsaw Packed being made with a kielbasa, the Adonis actually being a lamb sausage, the Haute Dog Parm having a chicken herb sausage, etc all topped with delicious and plentiful toppings. Once this place was discovered, most of the team now goes to Underdogs often for lunch!"
10298,32,2,1,7/19/2012,"While I really was wishing for a well-matched hot dog face off to go down in Philly, Underdogs just fell far short of the competition. ˜Not only is the sunken restaurant sullen, dingy, and depressing, the dogs have a distracting chewy casing and a bun so big you can barely see the tiny dog fighting for its life in the middle. And for another kick in the pants: the fries are greasy, thin and wobbly a la Micky Ds. ˜Appropriate occasionally, but I like a good thick frite with my hot dog. ˜And the sauces...meh."
10299,32,2,1,7/6/2012,"Terribly unforgettable. Though the vast menu promises otherwise, the end result is pretty average. ˜Their regular beef sausage is nothing to rave home about, not particularly flavorful, and the toppings not particularly plentiful. ˜The worst part, the bun, is toothsome and overly starchy. ˜It is way too bread-y ˜for a hot dog and is almost more hoagie-esque. ˜In my personal opinion, a bun should be soft, almost one with sausage and that each bite is equal 1/3 bread, 2/3 hot dog/contents. ˜With Underdogs' buns, I always manage to peel off more bread when eating these so I could enjoy the contents. ˜Unsuccessful. Affordable and toppings are fresh, but that's about it. ˜And on a total side note, as lamented by other reviewers here, I deeply miss Argan, the former occupant. I still dream of their ridiculously lovely baba. ˜Boo. :("
10300,32,4,1,6/25/2012,"Best dogs in Philly. ˜Huge selection. ˜I recommend their chorizo and any of the all-beef dogs. ˜Some weird combinations, but they always work out (fish cake and beef dog = A+). ˜I think the buns are homemade, either way, they taste like it, good stuff. Nice place to jump in for a quick bite. BYOB after 5pm."
8403,32,4,1,6/18/2012,"The only problem here, is deciding which dog to get. ˜There were tons of dogs to choose from. ˜I ended up with the Marrakesh and California Dreamin- both delicious. California Dreamin: topped with avocado. Marrakesh: margeuz sausauge with a mediterranean salad. ˜Fantastic. ˜Liked it more than the California. I had heard complaints that the bun wasn't soft enough, but I thought they were just fine. ˜ They were bigger than your usual hot dog bun to hold in all the extra toppings. ˜The fries came in a brown paper bag and were also really good, although not super crunchy. ˜The only downfall with this place is that they are a bit expensive. ˜The avg price is 4 bucks which seems a bit pricey for a hot dog. ˜I will definitely be back here again to try the other dogs they have. ˜I also love how they're open till 4AM on weekends!"
10301,32,4,1,6/17/2012,"I wasn't sure how a Thai hotdog with green papaya and peanut sauce would taste, but it was pretty good! The dog was good quality, too--this place is perfect for a late-night snack."
10302,32,1,1,6/13/2012,"this place is in a good location, near some bars I frequent, and open late on weekends. So I went in for some fries the other night. Had hot dogs before, nothin really special, I mean its a hot dog shop... But I heard the fries were good. so I got some and then the owner asked me to leave. I asked why, and then saw an ex's friend. So, I said it was kinda bullshit, since I was minding my own business, and security threw me the hell out. Ok. That's his job and I wasn't trying to fight him. But once outside, I was attacked by two random drunks, the bouncer kinda warded them off after they kicked me and tried to hit me, which was cool, but as I looked up, I saw THE OWNER STANDING OVER ME AND TAKE A SWING AT ME. I guess that speaks for itself, I was on the ground, pushed into the street by security guy and now being attacked by strangers and this skinny bald guy is swinging at me too. Seriously, why did he get involved? I understand kicking people out of places, especially late nights, and I wasn't fighting a 6'2"" bouncer, but the OWNER himself trying to blindside me? Don't know what to even call that..."
7764,32,4,1,6/4/2012,"I felt really fat afterwards, but man was it good at the time. We went for the marrakesh and the pero caliente, combo'd one order. ˜Perfect size for two people. ˜You get one small fountain drink, but a large order of fries with a rich mayo dipping sauce (we went for the old bay seasoning flavor). ˜The hot dogs came in these buns that were basically the love child of a regular hot dog bun and a baguette. ˜Not sure what it's actually called, but it has more definition and texture than an average hero. ˜Both dogs were delicious. ˜The marrakesh was lamby and smoky with a nice light cucumber and tomato salad on top. ˜The pero caliente had a mess of stuff on top, but most notably thinly sliced jalapeno peppers that weren't your typical ones out of a can. The fries were fresh and seasoned with good sea salt and came with your choice of one specialty dip. ˜Our Old Bay mayo was very flavorful and definitely rivals some of the dips of specialty Belgian frite places. ˜Sure it's a bit greasy, but that's to be expected. All in all, a delicious lunch. ˜I would definitely go back to satisfy a hot dog craving and try the other decadent looking choices they have. ˜I just don't like taking the walk of shame afterwards."
10303,32,4,1,6/4/2012,"Have to say I like Underdogs as much as Hot Diggity. ˜I think both are excellent and deserve success. ˜I think the goal is different for each so I expect a different experience. ˜Hot Diggity is more ""foodie""--shows me what a hot dog can be, pushes the boundaries. ˜Underdogs is more ""classic""--the dogs I tried tasted very much like hot dogs but classic in the ""best version"" of a ""normal"" hot dog. ˜Their Michigan dog is the classic Chili dog, great all around. ˜The Chicago dog isn't my favorite but was a decent version. ˜The Texas or Fried Dog w bacon was very good, and they weren't afraid to let it be somewhat greasy. ˜There's 23 dogs on the menu, and I will be back for more, especially curious about the Thanksgiving dog, made from Turkey Sausage, w. stuffing, gravy and cranberry sauce. The fries are thinner at Underdog, a bit greasier, but delicious. ˜The dipping sauces at Underdog were better, w. more balanced flavors. ˜Sometimes at Hot Diggity, i wonder, ""did anyone taste this sauce?"" ˜The intensity can be too much, too overwhelming, not just too hot, but sometimes too bitter or too sweet as well. ˜These fries worked perfectly w. all the sauces I tried. Price at Underdogs is great, around $6.50-$7.00 for a hot dog, fries and drink. ˜The size of the fries are a bit smaller and the soda comes w free refills which you have to get from the register person I was full. ˜In Philly, it's easy to pay $10-15 for a what is basically fast food, so I'm glad for this creative, tasty option. ˜I will still go to Hot Diggity and wish both places great success."
10304,32,5,1,5/24/2012,"This is one of the most original hot dog places I have ever been to and being a vegetarian they have so many choices to pick from. My favorite is the special with the veggie dog instead of a regular hot dog, it has Russian dressing and a homemade pepper hash. I have convinced a few meat eaters to try mine and they love it too."
10305,32,2,1,5/22/2012,"I'm not much of a hot dog fan, but I thought I'd give Underdogs a shot. Unfortunately, Underdogs performance was (ahem) sub par. Initially, I was excited (and a little overwhelmed) by the variety of hot dog styles available. The menu offers some pretty novel topping combinations. Like the ""Pero Caliente,"" which comes with pico de gallo, chocolate cayenne mole, jalapenos and sour cream. Sounds pretty awesome, right? Well, not so much in reality. The first thing I noticed was that the hot dog itself was barely warm. Yech! I imagined my hot dog bobbing around in a sea of tepid water with other lukewarm hot dogs. Double yech!! The second thing I noticed was the bun; it was basically an over-sized version of those 10-pack Wonderbread buns. I hate to sound like a food snob (which I totally am), but here's the bottom-line: If I'm going to pay a premium for a fancy hot dog, I expect a fancy bun! What about those cool-sounding toppings? Frank-ly (ha!), I don't know. I was too distracted by the aforementioned deficiencies to even notice the chocolate cayenne mole! It's really very sad. On a positive note, the french fries that came with my meal deal were pretty decent. So if you want to grab some fries, you could do worse than Underdogs. Just skip the hot dogs."
10306,32,1,1,5/22/2012,"Terrible! I got the Chicago dog and if you don't know how to make a Chicago hot dog just don't bother. When I picked up my order I had to clarify ""Is this mine?"" ""Is this the Chicago?"". It looked nothing like a chicago because all the toppings were placed underneath the dog. Every Chicago hot dog I've ever had the topping were on top. Furthermore it's supposed to be sprinkled with celery salt not celery seed. Big Difference. No poppy seed roll ok but the roll they gave me was hard and cold. The staff looked bored and unhappy."
10307,32,5,1,5/16/2012,"I boycotted hotdogs from age 8 through 16 for a reason that probably seemed totally legitimate in third grade but that I have since forgotten. I have nothing against the food now, but rarely think to eat it - it's just not on my radar. Apparently my subconscious really wanted me to try Underdogs, because I woke up from a nap in the middle of an incredibly vivid dream about eating an Italian sausage sandwich and knew that I had go to find one immediately. Never fear, Underdogs is here! Their menu has an extensive range of dawgs - ranging from traditional American favorites (the Texas Tommy) to innovative (I am now dying to try the Thai version with peanut sauce and green papaya). Clearly inspired by my dream, I went with ""the ninth streeter"" - Italian sausage with sauteed peppers and onions. It had classic Jersey shore flavor, but was much more delicious - great bun, delicious non-greasy sausage, really flavorful and well-cooked onions and peppers. The combo comes with a drink and a very generous portion of excellent fries. They have a ton of options for dipping sauce, I tried both the garlic aioli and Utah fry sauce. I purposefully am forgetting what they told me is in the Utah fry sauce because it is really delicious and ""ketchup, mayo, and pickle juice"" sounds too much like a concoction that sixth-grade boys try to make each other eat before throwing up. Just think of it as ""like Russian dressing."" Yum! The space is cute, there's lots of seating, and service is friendly and fast. I showed up half an hour before closing and they were still quite busy. Late-night hours, anyone? They would be a perfect spot for satisfying late-night cravings!"
10308,32,4,1,5/13/2012,"Great concept and staff. The dogs were delish and so were the fries and dipping sauces. Maybe it was the weather, but they had some sketchy clientele only there for the bathroom?? Other than that, it was a super fun night out with 4 girls, 4 dogs, and tons of fries! Ps they dont serve come products"
10309,32,5,1,5/8/2012,"Went to Underdogs for the 4th time tonight and as always they are great. I was coming from work in fairmount and was there 10 minutes before the 9pm close. I usually tend to stay away from that after going to other food places before closing and seeing the staff groan from last second customers but was instantly greeted and was not made to feel as a burden. I wish i got the name of the employee because he couldnt have been nicer and more helpful even offering a refill on my soda after seeing how quick i got into the first while waiting for my dog. As for the dog itself, I got the herb chicken parm dog with marinara and shaved parm and it couldnt have been better. the dog itself was tasty enough to stand alone but the marinara and shaved parm took it over the top. The side of sriracha mayo with my fries and I was feeling great. Cant wait to go back, thanks underdogs"
10310,32,5,1,5/8/2012,"In my local NJ neighborhood I saw two hot dog joints come and go, in the same building no less. I have a feeling if Underdogs inhabited the space, I'd still have a local hot dog joint. Decided to check this place out after reading Philadelphia Weekly's The Battle Between Two Hot Dog Joints. My boyfriend and I have been craving some good veggie dogs and yum yum: perfect. The veggie dogs were Yves Veggie Brat's I believe. The guy told me they usually use Tofurkey Brand but these were still great. We went with a couple of Coney Classics and at the suggestion of the staff, a Georgia Bulldog. The buns were picked with toppings, leaving a messy but extremely enjoyable hot dog experience. I can see why this place stays open till 4 am on weekends. We also got some delicious fries. They packed a lot in including a couple sauces Old Bay Mayo and another one I forget the name and it doesn't seem to be on the online menu. Great service, very friendly and seemed to really enjoy what they do. We got 5 hot dogs, a soda and large fries and the total was $25. I think that's a good deal."
10311,32,3,1,5/7/2012,"I had a special connection with Argan, the Moroccan restaurant that used to live down here, and was sad to hear it was closing. ˜So it was especially nice to see the first dog on the wall-menu was the Marrakesh -- a merguez sausage with a harissa sauce. ˜Sounded good, but I went with the Chicago style dog (sans peppers) and a side of fries. ˜The dog was tasty and the bun overflowed with some very yummy fillings. ˜I enjoyed every bite. ˜The plain dog was also a hit. ˜And the fries, while a bit greasy, came with a side dipping sauce of our choice and the one we chose (georgia mustard bbq) was excellent."
10312,32,4,1,5/5/2012,"A girlfriend and i stopped in before we headed out for the night.. Brought a bottle of wine (BYOB till 2am) We had the Marrakesh and the Chihuahua combos, and both were delish!! They consisted of a semi-spicy lamb sausage and great toppings. Staff was really friendly and helpful.. overall, great time!"
10313,32,3,1,4/29/2012,"I stopped in for a quick lunch. The dogs are all 100% beef. Ordered the My Thai hot dog. This consisted of a peanut sauce and pickled veggies. It wasn't bad, but there was really nothing special about it that made me go wow. I also ordered a small bag of fries. Pretty substantial for $2 and change. It comes with a single dipping sauce with an order, but you can get another for a mere quarter. I wish I ordered another, I think the sriracha mayo was calling my name. Anyway, the fries were done well enough and the garlic aoili was tasty. Not bad for about $6."
10314,32,1,1,4/26/2012,"came in here and waited in line for about 15 mins only to find that they were out of gluten free buns, despite the fact that they were still advertised on the CHALKBOARD next to the cash register. it's not a printed menu or a painted sign, it's a chalkboard, keep that sh*t up to date."
10315,32,3,1,4/24/2012,"I can't deny it -- I miss Argan, the unique Moroccan restaurant that used be here before. ˜Their freshly made pitas, meats, and veggies were incomparable. ˜But this is supposed to be about Underdogs.... Stopped here for lunch with a friend recently. ˜It was fairly busy with center city denizens stopping for lunch yet moved relatively rapidly. ˜In homage to the lost Argan, I ordered the merguez sausage; my friend got one of the chicken sausages. ˜A few minutes later, the dogs arrived at our table. ˜The merguez dog was tasty with a spicy core and a spicy topping. ˜The chicken one was okay, with a somewhat-tough casing and a relatively bland core. ˜The buns were nicely toothsome. ˜ So ... if you're by Rittenhouse and hankering for a dog, this is a fine spot to get one. ˜But I wouldn't trek out here for one. ˜Oh, Argan, you are indeed gone."
10316,32,4,1,4/19/2012,"I'm a big fan of most things about Underdogs: * the staff are great -- friendly, willing to discuss the product, service-oriented * the fries are excellent and the fry sauces are terrific (Utah Fry Sauce and Curry Mayo are my faves) * ˜the buns are chewy, sturdy and delicious without getting in the way of the sausage * the sandwich menu offers creative new combos as well as old classics * toppings are fresh, tasty and applied in good measure * the non-frankfurter sandwiches (I've tried all but 3) are uniformly delicious But, I don't love the hot dogs themselves, sad to say. I had a great conversation with Robert (owner/braintrust) about why they use a hot water bath rather than grilling the dogs, and to a lesser extent why they use the Dietz & Watsons - it's about replicating traditional Philadelphian hot dog service. He said that they would happily split and grill a dog for me any time, and not only have they done that, but he remembers me and offers to do it when I order. But after lunch today, I just have to conclude that I don't love the D&W dogs. But I do like Nathan's & Heb Nats, so it's not hot dogs in general. Don't get me wrong - I WILL remain a frequent customer, and I will get my name on a fist on the wall for trying all 23 dogs. But once I've done that, I will be sticking to the many excellent non-frankfurter options the menu provides - the 9th Streeter's spicy Italian, the Warsaw Packed's kielbasa and the Marrakesh's merguez are my faves so far. The Adonis (lamb with gyro toppings) and Brats were also quite good."
10317,32,1,1,4/19/2012,"UPDATE: I will not be returning to Underdogs. I went there the last time on 5/17. I was in a rush and wanted two dogs quick, it was not busy but it took forever to make them, whatever. As I waited, I could see the kitchen where the food was being prepared in full view. The ""chef"" was in the kitchen eating a hotdog, and I observed him putting the last bite into his mouth, and turning and getting buns for my hotdog - without washing his hands, using food prep gloves or even a wax tissue! I was appalled! I could get past the unsanitary (possible Board of Health Violation) habit of him eating in the kitchen, but I could not get past him them handling my food without gloves or washing his hands immediately after eating in the kitchen! I discretely mention this to a girl who tried to serve up the dirty dogs to me, and she tells me that didn't happen. After I insisted it did, because I observed it with my own eyes, she refused to make eye-contact me with and referred me to the girl at the cash register who offered to have the ""chef"" wash his hands and re-make the dogs. I declined, and asked for a refund which was promptly given. The real issue is whether they will teach the staff better food handling techniques? I will not go back to find out. __________________________________________________?___ I've been to Underdogs twice now, each time I got the veggie dog Chicago style. The second time I had the fries, but they were too greasy for my taste. I noticed they copied 5 Guys with the paper bag setup for the fries. The veggie dog Chicago style was good. I consider myself a veggie dog connoisseur, having tried plenty of brands, but the this dog was green/grey and I worried I would get food poisoning, luckily I did not, but the color weird's me out and I'm curious to know the brand they use. Overall, I say go, but bring cash because they are cash only!!!! The price is reasonable for a gourmet dog, the place is somewhat dive-y, but there is seating. The staff was friendly; just skip the fries unless you like grease."
8572,32,2,1,4/17/2012,"I guess I'm secretly kind of happy that Underdogs wasn't as good as Hot Diggity. It's approximately 200 feet from my office, and let's get real- if you eat too many hot dogs you start to look like a hamburger (sorry, that wasn't very funny. What I was going for was ROUND.) The veggie dog was thick, with a strange green/grey color. It didn't taste like a hot dog at all. The bun was too much and the sauerkraut was weak. French fries were fine, and I appreciate that the aioli was refrigerated (who wants room temp mayo?) however they simply can't compare to Hot Diggity's double-fried, Belgian-style taters. Decor was cute and service was good, but I won't be back to Underdogs unless I start eating beef again."
10318,32,4,1,4/17/2012,"I really loved these hot dogs! ˜The buns stand up to the toppings really well, they're not WAY too overstuffed (which can lead to toppings spilling everywhere) but are still substantial. ˜ Mine (the Brats) was pork sausage with sauerkraut and horseradish mustard, and it was really tasty, a spin on a classic. ˜My girlfriend grabbed a Georgia Bulldog which was also terrific. That pepper hash... it's sweet and fantastic, made in house and featured on a handful of different dogs. ˜ The fries were great, the sriracha mayo was delicious... I'm a fan, Underdogs."
10319,32,4,1,4/16/2012,"My boyfriend and I walked right by Underdogs while shopping around this weekend. Since we both love hot dogs, we decided it was the perfect place for lunch. I got the Georgia Bulldog which was awesome. I'd rather have my hot dog grilled on a flat top BUT this one was still delicious. It had this pepper hash on it that was awesome with a BBQ mustard. I love salty/sweet. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, I'll definitely hit it up again."
7427,32,4,1,4/15/2012,"I love spots like this. It's casual, funky, pretty dang awesome. Descend the steps to this unassuming spot for a creative hot dog or sausage. The meat is great quality, and I've heard mixed reviews on the buns, but I like it. It's hearty and doughy, and won't fall apart with the sausage and toppings. Here are the ones I had: - The Marrakesh - A delicious merguez sausage topped with nice Middle Eastern flavors. - The Chihuahua - I love chorizo, and the cheese and chipotle mayo go so well on it. - The Adonis - It tastes like gyro! - The Brat - Delicious Bratwurst. - The Michigan, The Chicago Style, The Georgia Bulldog - All nicely done. I love hot dogs and sausages, and as you can see I'm on my way to tasting all the flavors and getting my name on a fist on the wall. The fries are tasty as well, and I love the sriracha mayo and the malt vinegar aioli. Good stuff for a great lunch. Philly definitely needs more places like this."
8389,32,4,1,4/14/2012,"Kudos for knowing a bit of Philadelphia hot dog history - pepper hash and the Philly surf and turf; a hot dog with a fish cake. All that is missing is Levis Champ Cherry to wash it down. Locally sourced artisan dogs and sausages. Custom bun. Interesting condiments. Low price. Friendly employes. Yes, friendly wit no addytood. Two suggestions to them: a Rutt's Hut style ripper and a North Jersey Italian Hot Dog would bring the menu to a nice round 25 count. I'm already looking forward to going back."
10320,32,5,1,4/7/2012,"Where to begin? My girlfriend and I went there on a Saturday afternoon because I've been curious about the place since it opened. The decor is bright but not overwhelming with colorful geometric shapes contrasted by framed sports photos, and the music sounded like it was straight from one of my Pandora stations so I immediately felt at home. The menu is painted on the wall and is very easy to read which is an accomplishment because the sheer variety of hot dogs and sausages they provide is astounding with 23 options to choose from each at under $5 per dog, pocket change for a Rittenhouse Square establishment. While they have the typical hot dog choices, their ""Haute Dog"" menu includes ingredients such as peanut sauce and papaya coleslaw on their Thai inspired hot dog or pico de gallo and mole sauce on their Mexican one. There's enough variety here to satisfy everyone and if someone were to not find something that satisfied them they were dead inside to begin with. I had the My Thai and The Adonis (think lamb gyro, but in sausage form) and my girlfriend had the Michigan with beef chili, cheddar and mustard and the dogs were juicy and perfect, the bun was fresh baked and unlike any other roll I've had, and the toppings were fresh and delicious. On top of that, they make a game out of it where if you have every one of their hot dogs you get your name on the wall. I'm three down with twenty to go, and that is a challenge I will gladly accept."
10321,32,2,1,4/7/2012,Just ate here today for the first time and I was mad that I did. The hot dog bun was cold and too large for the hot dog. The hot dog was just very forgettable and being that it's a place based on hot dogs they better get it together. One pro was the fries which were not amazing but the malt vinegar aioli dipping sauce earned them 2 stars.
10322,32,4,1,4/7/2012,"I love hot dogs. ˜I was so excited when I first read about this place, and it did not disappoint. ˜I got the Michigan dog, which had beef chili, cheddar, onions and mustard. ˜I was expecting more chili and less cheese, but it was still pretty darn good. ˜And the combo comes with fries and a drink, for about $7. ˜Not bad for a center city lunch! ˜I tried the malt vinegar aioli dipping sauce, so good! ˜If you try all 23 of their hot dogs (and get your menu punched each time) you get a fist with your name on the wall! ˜Oh glory of glories! ˜I may not make it before I decide to give my arteries a break, but I'll sure have fun trying! ˜Oh, and it's open til 4am on Fridays and Saturdays, and I spied a sandwich board inside that said it was BYO after 5pm?? ˜I have yet to verify that though, but exciting nonetheless! ˜Can't wait to come back."
10323,32,4,1,4/3/2012,"If Occupy Philly had a sponsor, I like to think Underdogs would be it. It's a place where revolutionary spirit drapes the walls with its raised, clenched fist mural; the kind of artwork that would be welcoming to a group that, say, might want to overthrow the Fed and return to the gold standard. But as far as I can tell, Underdogs is less concerned with Ben Bernanke and more focused on putting out great hot dogs. The buns are not the flimsy 4th of July cookout ones you snag off a grocery store shelf. Sturdy, crackly sides are just dense and chewy enough to make you appreciate the quality rolls without any unnecessary padding. A proper meat/toppings to bread ratio is paramount and they've got it down. The Special ($3.50), with pepper hash and russian dressing, probably pairs nicely with 6-8 lagers and is a late night craving waiting to happen. The Chihuahua ($4.50) was my only foray into the sausages and the queso blanco adds a nice, needed smooth finish to play against the sharp spices of chorizo. The salty peanut taste of the My Thai ($4) dog marries well with the cool, crispy papaya slaw, but I only want peanut sauce with chicken and some kind of noodle. The fries ($2.25/reg) stand up on their own merit. Unless a better writer shows up to finish this review I'll lazily tell you to think of Five Guys fries, greasy paper bag and all. But stay away from the ketchup when you peel back your greasy bag of spuds. Utah sauce is another weird cult-ish thing to come out of Utah, but this one is actually worth following blindly. Ketchup, mayo, and pickle juice--stop, get that look off your face--forms a surprisingly addicting condiment. It's a fairly smooth concoction before the pickle juice kicks your palate with just a bit of brine. There was nothing wrong with the chocolate cayenne mole--nice heat and all--I just didn't think it matched up well with the spuds. The curry is good, too, and lacks heat if you shy away from it typically. First dipping sauce is free, second is 25 cents. Get at least two."
10324,32,2,1,4/2/2012,"Not sure what all the fuss is about this place. ˜It seems most of the reviews are about everything but the dogs/sausages. ˜Great fries, low cost, fresh toppings and good sauces. ˜The hot dogs (Dietz & Watson) are mealy and not much flavor to them. ˜I had the Back In the Day (needed salt) and the Chicago (you couldn't taste the hot dog) on my first try. ˜On my second the Chihuahua would have been great if not for the lack of chorizo. ˜It seems they cut one link in half in order to fill the length of the bun. ˜Either go with a bigger link or double it so you can actually taste the chorizo. ˜Definitely doesn't live up to the hype."
10325,32,4,1,3/30/2012,"They use Tofurkey Brats as veggie dogs here, which scores big points with me as a vegan. They're pretty fairly priced for what you get. I got the Chicago style dog and loved it. I'll be going back soon. They're also open til 4AM on weekends!"
10326,32,4,1,3/30/2012,"The gluten-free hot dog bun was surprisingly good, it looked like a shortened baguette. It may come from Tote bakery in the Italian market, not sure. If that's where they're from then I'm screwed in about an hour because their baguettes contain honey and chickpea flour which I'm not supposed to have. I opted for an original hot dog combo with spicy mustard on the dog and malt aioli for dipping. The hot dogs are really substantial and meaty- I couldn't finish it. I'm not a huge hot dog person so the largeness of it was a bit of a turn-off. The fries were excellent, though, much like 5 Guys does. My coworkers got a few hot dogs to try: Coney, Chicago, 9th Street, and the Smoker. Favorite was the Coney, the Chicago a runner-up (be warned that the peppers are pretty hot), and neither really cared for the Smoker hot dog. They said it was the sausage itself they didn't like, not the toppings so much. The place was pretty full the whole time we were there, from around 12:15 to 1-ish on a sunny Friday. The line moves fast because they take your order while waiting in line, then you pay and by the time you're done there your hot dogs are ready. If you snag a table they'll bring it right over to you. We lucked out and got a table, but there are only a few. Overall, though, $6.25 for an allergy-free solid lunch combo near Rittenhouse is nothing to complain about."
8657,32,4,1,3/30/2012,"Underdogs is a cool spot to grab an insanely cheap (especially for Rittenhouse area!) filling, good, not-your-every-day meal. I stuck to the tried and true original dog for trip one. ˜It was awesome. ˜These dogs remind me why I should never even think about going vegetarian again. ˜But wait, they have veggie dogs too. If you go, get the combo. ˜We got two combo meals for $13. ˜CHEAP. It's really cheap and their fries are awesome. ˜You get a free dipping sauce. ˜I got the horseradish mustard and it was excellent. Service was fast. ˜The restaurant is adorable, very bright and plays good music. ˜ Minus one star for unfriendliness. ˜Maybe it was an off day. ˜I'll give it another shot."
10327,32,3,1,3/29/2012,"Rebecca S. has nailed the review I was just about to post. ˜The truth is, without comparing UnderDogs to another one of my favorite hot dog purveyors in this city, it's hard to fault them. ˜But, I don't think its fair to say ""don't go here because its not as good as X"". ˜ I will say you SHOULD go to UnderDogs because you get a hefty wiener for just a few clams and the toppings are fresh and delicious. ˜The staff is friendly and helpful and the place is clean. ˜Even during a mid week lunch time rush, people weren't standing in line for more than a few minutes. ˜We had our dogs delivered to our table about 8 minutes after walking in the door. ˜I'd be all over UnderDogs if I was a center city worker or if I were trouncing the city at night. ˜With all the various flavors of dogs, there's no reason not to go back here at least a half dozen times."
10328,32,5,1,3/16/2012,"I love this place. ˜Firstly they get an extra star for the name alone. ˜Its the best name in the entire city (if you don't know it is ""under"" ground). ˜I have only had one dog, the Texas Tommy which was great. ˜The price is right, lunch for two was $13. ˜They are BYOB and open until 4am on Friday and Saturday night. ˜The owner, servers, cashiers were great. ˜ Some of these other reviews are a little ridiculous. ˜This place is not competing with Le Bec, this is a fun hotdog joint. ˜For fun hotdog joints, this place is doing 100% right."
10329,32,4,1,3/15/2012,"Veggie hotdog, whoohoo! ˜ I've been a vegetarian for over 10 years, so I've tried all different varieties of veggie hotdogs at home, and believe me, there are some terrible ones out there. Underdogs made a great choice in their veggie hotdog selection- it's actually more like a veggie kielbasa or sausage because it's thicker and more substantial then the normal ""hotdogs"" I've eaten. Also cool that you can have any type made with the veggie dog with no problem. I loved the atmosphere, the friendly staff, the gimmick and the pricing. The fries, dipping sauces, bun and toppings were great too. The only reason I withheld a star is because l would love it if they had an actual veggie hotdog option (for the hotdog side of the menu) like a SmartDog, and put their current selection on the sausage side. But hey, sometimes veggies can't be choosies. :/"
10330,32,5,1,3/15/2012,"Exactly what I've been looking for in center city. A combination of old school and modern, underdogs is a reinvention cooked for success. The ambiance was well put together, sublime playing in the background of the small store front. The store located underneath a much bigger building. I knew it was going to be good. I just didn't know how good. The menu was on the wall, the cook was singing to the lyrics and the other workers were laughing about some inside joke. It felt homey and happy. I ordered four dogs: the california dream, the tryp, the chicago and the warsaw. All were delicious, but the two that stood out were the tryp and the chicago. The first was a twist on the thanksgiving platter and the second a perfectly concocted traditionally structured dog: yellow mustard, relish, chopped onions, tomato slices, sport peppers, a dill pickle spear and celery salt. I was engulfed in flavor immediately. Basically delicious. And to top it off (pun intended) the owner walked over to our table personally and on his own, making sure we were enjoying the meal. Furthermore, he gave us a quick hot dog history lesson on east coast vs midwest coney dog. I simply can't complain. But then again, maybe their name shouldn't be underdogs."
10331,32,4,1,3/15/2012,"I've been to Underdogs four times since it opened just a few weeks ago. ˜Here are my observations: The two quality foundations of a hot dog are the the dog itself and the bun. ˜The dog should be plump and most ideally snap when the casing is bitten. ˜The bun should be proportional to the dog -- a thick bun should only accompany a substantial dog and it should be constructed strongly enough to support the dog and toppings (especially wet) without ripping at the bottom. It's obvious that Underdogs considered quality first when choosing their hot dog materials, as I have been completely satisfied each time. ˜My vegetarian companion confirmed that the veggie dog was of excellent quality as well. The staff is friendly, remembers repeat visitors, speaks to customers and appears passionate about hot dogs. There are a ton of dog options -- I can't say that I have a favorite yet, but quite enjoyed the Manhattan, which has an onion sauce similar to the traditional Sabbrets but less sweet. ˜There are also several attractive sausage options, but I haven't yet tried them. The fries, cooked in peanut oil, are a dream. ˜The dipping sauces are an excellent idea, though the fries are equally enjoyable in ketchup or alone. I find myself wishing that the sodas were a little larger in the combo, but the staff behind the counter is happy to provide a refill if necessary. The horizontally spread out menu is a little difficult to navigate, even on repeat visits -- they would be served well to add a vertical list that mimics their paper menu closer to the front door. ˜This might also help with some of the sometimes awkward queuing in the middle of the restaurant. Overall, a leading addition to the philly dog scene!"
10332,32,3,1,3/13/2012,"Def a solid place. I got a Michigander combo. This place carries Pepsi products, which is just stupid if you ask me. Why not carry coke, I mean coke and a hot dog. That's America. Pepsi and a hot dog? That's like, i dunno, Canadian. Anyways they have Dr. Pepper which kind of saved them. However, their syrup levels are a little off. The interior is kinda dilapidated, and it's only been open a couple weeks. I'd be curious to stop in a year later and see if that paper ""underdogs"" banner is still hanging on the grill exhaust. My guess is no. The fries are tasty. Peanut oil frying is the rage. Love the little brown paper bag they come in. The dog itself was good. Very meaty. I do wish there was a place that would actually grill a hot dog somewhere, but what can you do. The chili on the Michigander was just the right flavor to balance other ingredients, however, I could have used a touch more on mine. Service wasn't the fastest. Took probably over 15 minutes for my order to arrive and the place was essentially empty with about 8 employees standing around. ˜Price is fine, especially for the Rittenhouse neighborhood. Ohhhhhhhh, and I forgot about the dipping sauce. This was a low point. I tried the malt vinegar aioli. Tasted nothing like aioli and barely anything like malt vinegar. Basically it was like dipping my fries in mayo, and I'm not from England. So yeah, switch to coke, get a grill, clean the place up a little, ˜make it faster, and add some vinegar to your ""aioli"" ˜and you have a 5 star hot dog joint on your hands. Love the name btw, clever multi-faceted pun."
10094,32,3,1,3/13/2012,"I like this place, I do. The price is perfect for those not looking to do wallet damage on a quick lunch break, it's really convenient to both my weekday full time job and part-time weekend job, and the menu options are pretty much endless. I don't want three stars to scream ""it's just middle of the road"" because it's not if I could lean a little higher in the 3.5 range I would, to me it's literally the definition of A-Ok, not bad but not terrific. I went in armed with the knowledge that these are big beefy hot dogs and offerings of other assorted types of sausage, also that the dogs here are boiled instead of grilled. I already know that my preference is a thin dog of the New York streetside variety, and I also know that I generally prefer a hot dog to be grilled; I wanted to give this its fair shot though and so on my lunch break over the weekend I headed over. There are a ton of predetermined concoctions with a single dog running in the $3-4 area while the combo is somewhere in the $6-8 area, perfect for the wallet watchers. Many reviews talk about the Adonis which looked interesting enough, but I last minute decided to go with a ""California Dreamin'""...a dog topped with avocado, tomato, and a lemon mustard vinaigrette. I went for the gold and made it a combo with fries and a malt vinegar aioli and a soda rounding out my total to less than $8. A trip to the in-house ATM remedied the fact that this is a cash only establishment and I took my to-go order back to work. First thing I noticed, a mixed up soda order. While not a deal breaker, I was really hoping for that Dr. Pepper over the Root Beer...when you drink soda as infrequently as I do, these little treats and subsequent mishaps can make a heart sad. Second, the fries are pretty decent...certainly a dippable fry that can withstand a drag through a hefty dipping sauce, but nothing terribly exciting. Third, the hot dog itself? Well, you can't always sway a girl with a love for the grill, I wanted to love it but it was almost too meaty for a hot dog....is that possible? The avocado was nice and fresh, the tomato mixed in was a nice guac-like combination, but it seemed the lemon mustard dressing got a little lost. The presentation was nice, the gentleman at the counter (possibly the owner?) was very proud of the work that went into the dog as he made it a point to show me before closing up the box. Really nice employees, but in the end that didn't really salvage the so-so(ness) of my lunch. Maybe I should have gone with the Adonis, maybe the lamb and chicken sausage is where it's at. For the price, I wouldn't mind giving it another shot, there are a number of sausage and veg friendly options that I can see myself venturing towards, I just don't think these are the hot dogs for me."
10333,32,1,1,3/11/2012,"buns were frozen--ours was still cold from incomplete defrosting. ˜can't you stick that thing in an oven or toaster for half a minute? ˜the fries were very blah, overly soaked in grease. ˜with the variety on the menu, i was expecting something similar to the east village's crifdogs. ˜we were sorely disappointed (but at least the dog was colorful w/ all that mustard and relish). ˜the weiner was no better than boiling an oscar meyer at home. ˜despite how cheap it is, totally not worth it. ˜maybe my expectations were way too high going in. ˜this was the underdog i was rooting for that just couldn't deliver."
10334,32,4,1,3/10/2012,"Got the chihuahua dog, so damn good, though that didnt taste very queso fresco like to me. No matter though, whatever it was it was great. Asked one of the staff what dipping sauce to get and was recommended the bbq (perfect rec). Don't know why these little gourmet dog shops are all the fad now, but this place is good and nearby... I'll definitely return for another bite."
10335,32,4,1,3/10/2012,"Working in the mellon building, i couldn't have been more excited about a new cheap lunch option coming to the area. ˜I sent a message to my the marketing team and managed to get 5 over to the hotdog spot. ˜The line was almost out the door, but was moving pretty fast. ˜Underdog is very smart, taking orders throughout the line to keep things moving while money changes hands ahead of you. Instead of the reasonably priced combos, i decided to just get two dogs. ˜I went with the Penn Dutch (with spicy mustard and our house made pepper hash) and the Warsaw Packed (Czerw's smoked kielbasa with saut?ed onions and spicy mustard). ˜Both were great. ˜The pepper hash is sweet and tangy and is a nice contract to the spicy mustard. ˜The Kielbasa was juicy and garlicky and well complimented by the spicy mustard. ˜They were both lightly dressed, but there was more spicy mustard on the table to suit my needs. I am currently not eating french fries, which was particularly challenging as everyone else got them and gave them rave reviews. ˜There were plenty to go around and my lunch mates tried several of the sauces. ˜The only thing missing would have been a cheese sauce option. ˜I wont apologize, i like a good cheese sauce!!!!! Others at the table tried the Texas Tommy (wrapped in bacon, fried and topped with cheese) which has all you could ever want in a bun, the 9th Street (Fiorella's spicy Italian with saut?ed peppers and onions) voted best by our youngest eater and the Hot Dog Parm (chicken herb sausage, marinara and Parmesan cheese shavings), which i had zero interest in. ˜ Overall, great new addition for the hotdog/sausage lover. ˜Cash only but there is an ATM in there."
10336,32,3,1,3/9/2012,"I went here the other day for a quick bite. The menu was extensive, having every type of topping you could imagine a hotdog to have. I chose The Warsaw with some sauerkraut on the side. While anxiously waiting for my dog I noticed the ambiance. The decorative walls reminded me of something Shepard Ferry would paint, but in yellow. The music they were playing was better than some bars I've been to in the city. When I finally got my hotdog, after the guy who came in after me got his first, it was really great! The spicy mustard was very tasty as well. The sauerkraut, unfortunately, did not win me over. It did not have much taste, and did not resemble sauerkraut all that much. Overall, I would go back, but I think the service could be better and I definitely would not order the sauerkraut again."
10337,32,4,1,3/8/2012,"Their colors might as well be a tribute to the kit colors of ""AverageJoe's"" Dodgeball team. Their toppings are as fresh and crisp as the 80's Ice Rink, when the Miracle on Ice took place. Their sauces and hot pickles packs as much punch as Rocky balboa's puglist win over Apollo creed. It would have been the Stadium staple during the ""Miracle Mets Era"". The Dogs are as juicy and massive as Goran Ivanisevic's Serves during his Wimbeldon run in 2001. You'll want to come back again and again, just like Liverpool plotted their comeback from 3 goals down to win the Uefa Cup. So don't wait ˜for someone to chant ""Rudy Rudy Rudy"", ˜just go ahead and score yourself a hotdog at Underdogs !"
10338,32,4,1,3/7/2012,"I love this place! I got a Coney Island dog and fries with the malt vinegar aoli. ˜Everything was amazing, and that means a lot coming from me because I'm picky as hell. ˜As someone who grew up eating only Hebrew National, I really like that the hot dogs are all beef. I'm deducting one star because, though I know it can't be helped due to the location of the restaurant, but I don't like the atmosphere much. ˜The place is really tiny, underground, and when I was there yesterday it was FREEZING inside. ˜But the food and graphic design is so awesome that it more than makes up for it. ˜Maybe they'll make enough $$ that they can upgrade the location one day."
10339,32,4,1,3/6/2012,"Let's talk about the location of Underdogs for a second. It's clever that the name might be a play on the location of the restaurant - it's underneath a building. You have to walk downstairs to get your underdog. Let's talk about hot dogs at Underdogs for a second. These dogs are like the bulldogs of hot dogs...a'int no whimpy wieners here...just plump, girthy beef to fill up your gut. The Coney Classic is delicious - the mustard is spicy and the sauerkraut is crunchy. The dog is juicy and beef-y...a'int no fillers here. The Adonis is fine too - though the lamb tastes a bit more like falafel than an animal of any sort. Trick your vegetarian friends - tell them about the new falafel hot dog. Let's talk about the french fries at Underdogs for a second. They're dark gold and oh-so-diappable. They're bendy and are well suited to the Georgia BBQ Sauce - whatever this is, it's indescribably wonderful. The Malt Vinegar aioli is delicious as well - but mix it up a bit so that you get more of the malt than the mayo. The chocolate cayanne mole is definitely an adventure worth exploring - it tastes a bit like pureed beef chili. The pico de gallo isn't really a dip because it really is pico de gallo. Let's talk about the best way to eat at Underdogs. Skip the bun. Eat the dog (1.5 dogs per person is sufficient). Share a regular size fry (or large if you're a fiend) and order as many dipping sauces as possible. GET THE GEORGIA BBQ SAUCE AND THE MALT VINEGAR AIOLI."
10340,32,4,1,3/5/2012,"As a Michigander, I'd like to lay some knowledge on Underdogs: Here's how you got the Michigan wrong in case you were going for authenticity: A Michigan Coney Island, is made with YELLOW mustard, never spicy, and NO CHEESE. ˜Onions are optional, mustard is optional, but never never with cheese. ˜This is not a chili-cheese dog, or even a chili dog. ˜The best Conies are made with hotdogs in natural casings that snap when you bite into them. ˜That's just how we 'Ganders get down. Here's what you got right: the coney sauce is pretty good and the overall taste is close. ˜The hotdogs themselves are tasty. ˜ I'll come back for a taste of home, and can't wait to try the other dogs. ˜ Good job!

10342,32,5,1,3/4/2012,"After hearing about ˜Underdogs from several friends who work in the city and had checked it out during opening week... I decided to take a bike ride from the burbs on Saturday and see/taste for myself. I was happy to find that it was everything I had heard that it was. Unique. Inexpensive. Delicious. Super friendly environment. And MANY great sausage and hot dog sandwiches to choose from. I no longer think of a hot dog as simply a pork stick... But a canvas to express many different and unique flavors and the themes. From Italian to Mediterranean to Mexican flare. The only hard part was deciding which direction to go. Luckily the staff was extremely helpful in guiding me and explaining the menu and all of the different options (including a plethora of homemade dipping sauces for the perfectly cooked fries). Order the combo... comes with a drink and fries and is a great value. The owner even came over to see how I was enjoying everything... And then went on to tell me about the ingredients and the various local Philly businesses that supply them. I thought that was very cool. Especially for a place called ""Underdogs"" ;) I did hear that there can be a long line at lunch during the week... But that it moves fast and once you place your order, your food comes right up. I will be back soon!"
10343,32,4,1,3/4/2012,"I had been keeping tabs on this place, and with a quick dinner in mind, my bf (who is on Yelp finally!) and I went here on a Saturday a bit before 6. People were in and out, but it wasn't too busy at all. Hailing from Berks County (""Western Pennsylvania"" as some of you Philadelphians like to call it), I had to get the Penn Deutch dog with spicy mustard and pepper hash. I got a combo, which I feel is a good deal. Also, ""the quality of the dog was outstanding!"" My BF got the Texas Tommy, as I knew he would (it's wrapped in bacon and fried). They've got quite a bunch of creative dogs on the menu, each different enough that you'll want to try them all! Veggie and gluten free dogs are an option as well. Underdogs will keep it interesting with a dog of the day. The dipping sauces will entice you to get fries, probably every time. Nice work to Underdogs' friendly staff! This is going to be a great spot for lunch, dinner, & late night. I will be back!"
10344,32,5,1,3/3/2012,"Inexpensive, quick, close, stellar service and an incredible variety of sauces ... Underdog's pushing all my buttons at once! My friend and I split the My Thai (asian slaw and peanut sauce on an all-beef hot dog) and a kielbasa w/onions, peppers and spicy mustard (the name of which escapes me) because we couldn't each choose 1. Both were good and everything tasted fresh and as wholesome as this type of food gets. A large fry is good for two to share, and the fries are (as others have said) perfectly cooked and salted. The sauces are great - BBQ, peanut, different mayos, curry, vinegar, chipotle flavors - fun to sample. The staff is very nice and gave us a few to try for free. It was lunchtime on a Saturday and it was surprisingly empty, but the owner said it has been very busy, which was good to hear. Some suggestions: sweet potato fries? a wheat roll option? open a branch at Citizens Bank Park? Either way, I'll be back when I need my next Underdog fix...which will be soon. Hope these guys continue to do well!"
10345,32,4,1,3/2/2012,"Went here for dinner tonight with my boyfriend. ˜It was really good overall - clean, inexpensive, yummy and really nice service. ˜If you can believe it, I am a hater of hotdogs, but there were plenty of non-hotdog options with a variety of sausages. ˜I had the Adana, which is a lamb sausage fixed like a gyro. ˜I really liked the sausage and the bun, which was better than your average bun. ˜My boyfriend had the Michigan dog, and as a native Michigander he was pretty pleased. ˜He said it was not as good as the ""coneys"" from home, but the best Michigan style dog he's had outside of Michigan. ˜The fries were good - kind of like Five Guys fries. Everything was so good we got take out for my sister when we finished eating. All the hot dogs are between $3 and $5 with the hot dogs on the lower end and the sausages on the higher end. ˜Combos come with a drink and a pretty decent amount of fries and are around $7. There are so many options - I'd love to try more of them. I could see this place being great for kids on the weekends, but even better - it is open until 4am on Fridays and Saturdays, a temptation I hope not to take succumb to too often. ˜Also, it's cash only, but there is an ATM there."
10346,32,4,1,3/2/2012,"a new spot for junk food? count me in. there's a lot to like here. the concept is simple but very well done -- lots of choices and quality toppings (good thinking with the menu on the wall). early favorites for my hubby and me are the ""brats"" (sauerkraut soothes my polish soul!) and the marrakesh (packs a little heat). i'm not picky about much, but fries don't fall under the ""much"" umbrella, and i was really happy with the ones here. dark, crispy, skin on, perfectly salted. and like most consumers, i like to feel like i'm in control of my experience, so i appreciate the freedom to choose among a dozen dipping sauces (georgia mustard BBQ all the way). i've only been here post-5 p.m., so i can't speak to the lunchtime crowds, but you're totally safe going in the evening. do it!"
10347,32,4,1,3/2/2012,"Center City West (Rittenhouse Area) is finally getting a nice little roster of cheaper quicker but still quality eats. ˜I was happy when Hot Diggety opened last year, but its just a little too far away for a quick lunch break. ˜But Underdogs is in a perfect location for me to hit for lunch. I heard the lines were long at peak times, so I went for a late lunch today - around 2PM. ˜It was medium-busy, and there were a couple of people in line befoire me, but it moved fast. They have lots of dog-options written on the wall, which you can read while in line, which is nice (and the combo price is written there too). I got a ""Michigan"" combo which is chili, cheddar cheese, onions & mustard. ˜The combo includes fries & a drink. ˜You get one free dipping sauce with an order of fries. ˜$0.25 for an additional sauce. ˜The whole thing cost less than $8. ˜Not bad at all for a center city lunch. The hot dog was great. ˜The chili was tasty but not overly spicy - just like hot dog chili should be. ˜Quality beef dog with a good bun. ˜It seemed like the bun was slightly toasted or something, but I'm not 100% sure. The fries were well-done, fresh and good. ˜They reminded me of the fries at Five Guys so if you like those, you'll probably like these too. All in all I'm really happy that Underdogs is in the neighborhood & I can't wait to try the rest of the menu."
7088,32,4,1,3/2/2012,"Just ate here, definitely going to be going back!"
10348,32,4,1,3/1/2012,"Hot dogs. They're the latest trend; a hot dog joint is the new burger joint. Even so, I think hot dogs have an indelible place in American culture (indelible, not inedible), so it's hard to write off a hot dog joint as just another trend. With so much regional variety in the world of hot dogs, Center City was due for a eatery that could bring together these styles and add their own unique dogs. Underdogs is that place. I stopped by for takeout today at noon and waited in a long line filled with people that I assume had just seen the Foobooz post on this place. I didn't mind the line, because it gave me plenty of time to study all the menu options printed on the wall. The combos are priced below most area lunches at less than $8 after tax for a dog, fries, and a drink. I started my Underdog journey with a Michigan style dog-- chili, cheddar, chopped onions, and mustard. I mostly made this choice because my last transcendent hot dog experience happened at a hot dog institution in Grand Rapids, Michigan called Yesterdog. Underdog's version was somewhat different (it didn't have a pickle) but still delicious. I think I will hit up the Chicago style next, so that I can get my pickle fix. Fries were also solid and there were a ton of tasty fry sauces to choose from. The rest of my coworkers also enjoyed their dogs... we'll be back in force soon!"
10349,32,4,1,3/1/2012,"Ok so I went to try out Underdog today, even after reading Christine's suggestion to wait until off hours and the place was packed!! Decided to wait until after work and just pick up dinner from there and it was 1000% better at round 4:45, no wait at all. I got a veggie version of the Chicago style dog to take home but had to try it in the store and at first bite I was a little afraid. Nothing to do with Underdogs dogs but As a new vegan/vegetarian (working out the kinks of giving up dairy:)) as well as a person that's very particular about her hot dogs, I only like beef and certain brands I had a fear of not finding a suitable substitute and can't see me going without that yummy flavor for life. ˜However the bite that I'd taken did not include any of my toppings, just the ""dog"" and the bun so I was hopeful. So when I got home and ate it in it's entirety I was very pleased. It gave me the bite/texture of a hot dog although it doesn't have the exact same taste and the toppings made it taste as if I was eating a regular dog with some additional spices to it. Yet for vegetarians who are not fans of mock foods tasting too close to the real thing, I didn't feel it gave me that at all. Just tasted enough like a hot dog to satisfy when a craving for one hits. I also got the combo which came with fries and a drink, and the fries came with a dipping sauce, I chose the garlic aioli (again with my dairy wrestling) and it was really tasty. I look forward to going again!"
8351,32,4,1,3/1/2012,"Really glad this place just opened a few blocks from work. Sometimes all I want is a good hot dog. I like the buns, they are a little crispy on top and there's a decent bun to dog ratio. The topping choices are pretty great and the prices aren't bad. ˜I really want to try every combo. ˜I went with the Adonis, lamb sausage, tomatoes, onion, and tzatziki. ˜The concept is great, and it reminds me of a gyro, but the sausage was a little too greasy. ˜The fries are awesome, very brown and nicely seasoned. I love the garlic aioli. ˜I'll be back. ˜It was packed so try to come at an off time."
10350,33,1,0,3/14/2012,"this place ˜sucks ˜i pay 5.50$ chicken quesadillas ˜and the menu said 5.00$ and ˜it was really small, smoothies was ok but i had better! i don't think ˜a serious ˜place for business will put ˜prices on ˜the menu and charged different prices ˜, i don't mind may paid extra and leaving the tip which i did!, but a they should ˜charged whatever is in the menu, and not ˜whatever they think its fine!"
10351,33,4,0,3/2/2012,The food was great.. i had a iron bound burger and if i hadn't been full with the fries and smoothie i would have order desert. a little pricey but i didn't mind.. the smoothies are amazing. the wait staff was pretty cool they let my friends and i just hang out after we ate. I'm going back for sure..

10355,33,4,1,5/2/2012,Yesterday I just had to get a smoothie in this warm weather. This place is the best smoothie place I have every been to. I got a wildberry blast along with a cheese steak good food I just couldnt finish because it was a lot of food so I took my remaining food home.
10356,3842,1,0,12/15/2014,ok besides the fact i found a piece of hair in the aji verde the untrained waitress was very rude and dropped some of the ceviche juice on my pants. then she completely forgets our table was there. when she finally brought our food she forgot to put in a order of fried plantains ohh did i mentioned they didnt have any pinaple juice which took her about 15 minutes after i order to let me know they ran out. then as everyone loves waiting i waited half a hour for her to bring my check. wow whats going on with this place? 2 years ago i would be the first one to say this place was amazing but now they just dont care... btw corn on thr cob was mushy and old as well as the sweet potatos. never coming back even if they paid me. sorry piolyn jr but now you guys suck. btw i have a picture of thr hair i found in which the waitress tried to play it off.
10357,3842,1,0,1/13/2013,"I'm just going to just cut to the chase , this place went downhill . I have been going to Piolin restaurants for a long time . Although Piolin Jr was very disappointing . The portions got smaller , the food is not tasty anymore ! They are cutting back it seems and it shows . For the price you pay ! The managers don't care about their customers when it was brought to their attention that we got one potato ( papa huancaina dish ) it used to be 5 potatoes . I'm just never going here again , there's too many to list ."
10358,3842,1,0,9/13/2012,"The food tasted good , but when the check came a cockroach ran across the table which ruined the entire experience. Needless to say my wife, my brother and I will not be back to eat here."
10359,3842,1,0,8/19/2012,"WHAT A RIPOFF! As a white guy getting seafood w/rice to go they put only 3 shrimps and 2 clams in the $17 dinner, then after a call to the manager by my spanish wife who always gets a ton of seafood, they claimed to be the owner and said thats all you get. NOT TRUE! This restaurant discriminates against white people as opposed to spanish or peruvian people. What a disapointment for a restaurant with such a good reputation in the hartford area. Obviously things are not going well at PIOLIN!"
10360,3842,3,0,10/22/2013,It's ok. Don't make a special trip. I had the house special ceviche and I was happy with it but not something to rave about. ˜It also took a little too long to come out of the kitchen. ˜The food is a little better than the atmosphere.
10361,3842,4,0,2/25/2013,Yummy food and large portions for a great price. Plenty food to share! The interior isn't the nicest to look at but the food is great and that's what matters

The french fries and salad was good. Everything was excellent, what a nice meal. Compliments to the cook.

I told her she needs to try the food, she would like it. thanks again for a delicious meal. Linda"
10368,3842,5,0,8/1/2013,Have gone to Piolyn Jnr a couple of times and have never being dissapointed just had chicken Chafa for lunch. Awsome!

10371,3842,3,1,12/28/2014,"I have to agree with other's comments about ˜the service (could be better) and the food (really good). ˜Sopa de mariscos, pollo asado, ensaladas- todo estuvo muy bueno ˜- it was all very well prepared and tasty."
10372,3842,3,1,6/22/2014,"Although the service is not that great, the food is amazing! ˜ Ceviche and jalea are most deliciosa ones. Also, pollo a la brasa is a great deal for about $16, it can feed 4 people and everyone loves it :)"
10373,3842,5,1,6/12/2014,"Piolyn is one of the most underrated gems in the Hartford area. It may be the location... that doesn't stop a diverse and consistent clientele from visiting but eventually these folks will get more enterprising and probably turn this into a much more expensive place. Tylically, an order of a rib eye dish will do to give you a sense of the place. ˜But among the more outstanding dishes is a shrimp soup in a milk based broth. The yucca fries are great as are the maduros (fried sweet plantains). For that matter, the bread, corn bits, and sauces they bring to the table before your meal are great treats. The roasted chicken dishes are great as well. While the dishes seem a bit pricey the servings are ample and - at least in my visits - the bill surprising low for the amount of food. The service is excellent. Our waitress was among the best we have had anywhere, in a while."
10374,3842,2,1,7/19/2013,"Zibendou took me here but actually wanted to take me to their other location but this was closer at the time. Honestly, I wasn't impressed. We got the chicken, some rice, plantains and salad. None of it was really good. I wouldn't come back here. I guess I should have tried their other location..."
10375,3842,4,1,3/22/2013,"My SO and I got a Groupon to this place and decided to try it out before it expired (lol). Our favorite Peruvian restaurant was hands-down, Cora Cora, and following a disappointing experience at La Kerencya, we were a bit hesitant to try a new place. We liked the canchas and creamy garlic sauce, which had a nice kick to it. ˜Probably the best one I've tried so far! ˜Our waiter was nice enough to give us extra after seeing how much we enjoyed it. ˜ The menu had pictures, which were really useful. ˜The SO got the mussels app, and I the papas a la Huanca­na, a safe vegetarian dish for me. ˜The mussels were apparently DELICIOUS as he went through them at the speed of light! ˜My papas tasted wonderful as usual - the cheese sauce here is more pungent than at other places. The first dish out was the mixed ceviche. I sampled a bit of the sauce and found much more acidic than at other places. ˜The SO loved it though, and remarked that it had the right amount of heat and balance of flavors. ˜I got as an accompaniment the Criolla salad, which was basically ceviche onions/veggies in the same lime marinade. Again, good, but VERY acidic. ˜I personally would not get that again because I don't like the feeling of my teeth melting off :) I ordered the arroz chaufa with vegetables - what's a vegetarian to do? LOL. ˜I enjoyed it though, as I always do. It went wonderfully well with the rest of the food that I could eat! They gave us huuuuuge portions and we were absolutely beyond stuffed when we left. The service was gracious and accommodating and we would definitely return again. ˜The only complaint, really, was the acidity of the food."
10376,3842,2,1,11/25/2012,"1) ˜Reason for Coming Mark and I along with another couple on a Saturday evening came here for our first Peruvian dining experience. ˜The couple that we came with had eaten here before and since they had a Groupon we were happy to tag along. 2) ˜Ambiance I was not sure what to make of the place when we walked it. ˜The restaurant was dead and the waitresses looked bored and were watching European soccer on television. ˜There were two dining areas and we were seated in the larger of the two. ˜There were plenty of tables that started to fill up as the evening went on. ˜Both rooms look like they are transformed into a dance floor but I forgot to ask the waitress. The dining room is very casual to the point where they were showing both European soccer as well as playing what appeared to be You Tube videos of Latin American Music. 2) Food Once we sat down and handed our menus our drink orders were taken. ˜Mark and one of our friends got some Peruvian beer (both of which were good) and I wanted a glass of wine but of the six choices listed on the menu they only had merlot available by the glass, and I am not a big fan of this variety. As mentioned by some of the other reviewers even though we were seated quickly and drink orders taken it took a bit of time for our waitress to scavange the beers for the boys and take our orders. The menu is very..... busy. ˜For a first timeer like myself it was very overwhelming ˜and I was surprised that mostly every dish came with french fries and/or white rice and had eggs incorporated into it. ˜Our waitress was helpful in assisting me with narrowing down my menu choices. We started out with two appetizers - muscles (spicy) and cerviche (which I love!). ˜The food came out relatively fast (which was a plus becuase there were hardly any other customers there) but then that is where the evening takes and unfortunate turn. The muscles had just enough spice but unfortunately this flavor was over powered by the sheer potency of the lime juice and quantity of red onion. ˜Now I like both of those flavors but I felt like I was eating an entire lime. ˜The chevice was not much better - served in a martini glass it was more like a soup and even after I drained the juice and put some on my plate I was unable to taste the seafood, just lime. Unfortunately my dinner was not much better - I ordered the Piolin Jr ceviche ( little did I know what I was getting my self into at the time) which came with sweet potato and fried calamari. ˜I asked for a substitution of yucca fries instead of sweet potato but was unable to get it so I ordered it as a side. ˜Service was quick but the Yucca fries were brought out before the rest of the meals and unfortuantley they were not warm to begin with and got colder as I awaited my meal. ˜ When I did get my meal - there was one LARGE black hair in the middle of the plate. ˜The waitress brought it back but there was no apology from her nor did the manager come out to apologize. ˜This ceviche was a bit better but my mouth had so much lime flavor in it that it was hard to taste anything else. ˜Yucca fries were - meh and not seasoned. ˜ My husband and my friend got one of the steak dishes with egg and white rice ˜and they allowed my husband to substitute plaintains for white rice (wonder why he was able to but I was not). ˜He enjoyed the steak - not overly seasoned and the egg had a slightly runny texture to he. ˜He was also nice enough to share some of his plaintains and steak with me as I was very disappointed and done at this point. ˜I personally did not enjoy the steak as it seemed over cooked and underseasoned for my taste buds. 3)Overall impression - Very disappointed by my first Peruvian experience. ˜ I will not give up on this cuisine just yet. ˜Poilin Jr. was just not my cup of tea"
10377,3842,4,1,9/23/2012,I love the Rice with chicken.
10378,3842,4,1,7/8/2012,"Although I usually stick to ceviche and crunchy fried seafood at Peruvian eateries, Nick and I have been on a Peruvian charcoal roasted chicken kick these days. While working our way through the area's restaurants, we stopped at Piolin Jr for some Peruvian rotisserie chicken (and sweet plantains...and ceviche...). At both Piolin Jr and Cora Cora, I'm amazed by the value of their chicken platters (sounds like fast food, right?). $9.00 for half a chicken - rubbed with paprika, cumin, garlic & oregano, then bathed in a tangy marinade of white vinegar, lemon, and....alright, I don't know what else - roasted to perfection and served with salad and fries. Easily enough for two people. The chicken was tender, moist and intensely flavorful, especially when paired with the sweet plantains and the house aji sauce. Honestly, with such fantastic meat, I'd prefer they didn't automatically add in a half-assed iceberg salad and mound of fries - the chicken (and whatever extra sides I order) needs no extra embellishment! All in all, very satisfying meal."
10379,3842,3,1,5/29/2012,"Ok so after reading some of the reviews here, I urge people trying Peruvian food for the first time to do these things: - Don't order something that sounds like Chinese food, such as Arroz Chaufa. A lot of Peruvian dishes are influenced by Chinese immigrants since there are a ton in Peru. Don't expect something completely different (they also have these dishes for ""American"" taste buds). Same goes for Pollo Saltado (the dish with chicken and noodles, aka Lo Mein Peruvian style). Unless this is what you are looking for, then don't order these things. - I recommend trying to roisterer chicken ""Pollo a la Brasa"" and for the price, yes, ice berg lettuce is what you are getting. If you are looking for something a bit more and a bit more with the price tag, again go to Cora Cora in Hartford and I believe they just opened up another super fancy Peruvian Resturant in Hartford (don't know the name and I can't vouch for it since I haven't eaten there). - Try the seafood since that is very Peruvian, if thats not quite your style or taste, try a Menu item. Some things that might appear are: Aji de Gaina (a yellow cream over shredded chicken with boiled potatoes), Papa la huancaina, Causa, and Escabeche de Pollo (fried chicken with a red spicy sauce over it). I hope this is helpful for people trying Peruvian food for the first time! :D"
9109,3842,3,1,4/30/2012,One day on my way to Pho 501 I stopped by Piolin Jr because the wait at Pho 501 was too long. The place was empty and so the service was fast. ˜The staff was attentive. It was my first time trying Peruvian in the States. ˜I loved the canchas (dried roasted corn) and the marinated onions. ˜I nibbled on those while I waited for my entrees. We ordered the chicken special and rice with mixed seafood. I think I made my selection based on the pictures on the menu. We got tons and tons of food. ˜The food was on the saltier side but I normally don't cook with salt so I assumed I was sensitive to salt. Rotisserie Chicken $5.99 This was an amazing bargain!! Why go to KFC when you want chicken when you can get a full meal here for half of the price. The $5.99 price tag gets you fries and a salad. ˜Yes it was an ice berg salad but I did appreciate the cucumbers and carrots. I packed that for work later that evening. NO complaints about the fries from me other than WAY too much salt. If you plan on ordering fries here ask them to cut down on the cut or else you'll be in sodium overload before you leave the restaurant. Rice with Mixed Seafood $13.99 Enormous portions. ˜Again very salty but has such great potential to be an amazing meal. You will need the marinated onions to decrease the saltiness of the dish. I like the flavors and the ingredients but couldn't bare the saltiness. You can have a little then it gets too much. ˜Would I order again? Yep! I would simply ask for less salt and maybe hot sauce. Overall a cheap afternoon lunch. I left with tons of leftovers. The service was friendly. The place was relatively clean but you can tell at night time this place must turn into a dance club or something based on the smell.
7818,3842,3,1,3/11/2012,"We purchased a Groupon for Piolyn recently because we wanted to try Peruvian food. ˜I'm pretty sure almost every table in the place when we went was a purchaser of a Groupon. ˜It was loud in there and the DJ kept scratching and interrupting tunes but that didn't bother us too much. ˜The food was decent. ˜The sauce they give you with the bread and corn is very tasty. ˜I got the house soup for my appetizer and that was the best part of the meal. ˜Very flavorful with large, tender pieces of stewing beef and potatoes. ˜My entree turned out to be just an ENORMOUS pile of fried rice. ˜So much so that I had 3 days worth of lunch to bring home with me. ˜It was okay but nothing other than fried rice you'd get at a Chinese place for $5. ˜My bf opted for a steak and basil pasta dish and his portion of pasta was also ridiculously large. ˜The steak, he thought, was nothing but a thin slice of very tough london broil. ˜Yuck. Overall the place was okay. ˜The service was great - very attentive and friendly and not slow at all. ˜With the Groupon we were limited to a prix fixe menu so perhaps their regular menu items are better. ˜I can't see us going back to find out, though."
10380,3842,2,1,3/5/2012,The food was salty and greasy. It had no flavor. They didnt have some of the options available for desert so I was disappointed. The food was over priced for the quality of the food. This was my first time having Peruvian food ... it was really close to chines take out food. My meal was cooked in soy sauce and I really didnt like it. The customer service was amazing. The waitress didnt speak much English but she saw that I didnt like the food so she replaced it with the simple fried fish.

8219,3842,4,1,11/11/2011,"Piolyn Jr is a decent peruvian restaurant in East Hartford, CT, we ate a few weeks ago. It is a bar / nightclub combo with on street parking. For our entrees we ordered the Saltado Mixto (14.00, mixed beef & chicken) as well as the Marisco combination, basically an enormous seafood platter. Service was okay, the staff was very friendly, however it took forever to get our food."
10382,3842,4,1,7/3/2011,"Ate here this afternoon. Had eaten in the Hartford site but found this to be a real treat. Ceviche Mixto was fresh and delicious and the Chaufa de Mariscos was super and enormous. Great service, nice people. Read review at mofongoman.blogspot.com"
10383,3842,3,1,7/4/2009,"Oh, Piolyn Jr.... you could be a 4 star if not for your crappy slow service. :p On the other hand, you could also be a 2 star if not for your fun dance club on weekend nights. Us Peruvians can't survive more than a couple of days without eating our cuisine, so my cousin whisked me to Piolyn Jr. on my 2nd day here for dinner. :) It started out well enough... The smiling sun that is the D'onofrio ice cream mascot greeted me from a poster at the door and I instantly smiled back... Peru has awesome ice cream and I haven't had any since I was in Lima!! :D So dessert was covered before we even ordered our dinner! Anyways, we all get seated and my little niece and I mull over the menu while her parents stare at us in annoyance (it's hard for both of us to decide! :p and so what if she's 8 and I'm... not 8.) Finally, we settle for Pollo a la Brasa (Peruvian style rotisserie chicken), and my cuz and her hubby decide to share a plate of Lomo Saltado (beef with sauteed tomatoes, onions and french fries). In the meantime, since we were pretty hungry, da hubby ordered a plate of Yucca Frita (fried Yucca). The waitress brings us a basket with like 5 very thin slices of bread... yummy with the aji sauce, but c'mon... we're 4 1/2 people here! ˜Sigh... I missed La Pizza Grotto and its soft, homemade buttery dinner rolls... yummm... So we wolf down the bread in like 3 seconds (even the 2-year old wasn't satisfied!) and ask the waitress for more, and I request some water (the Chicha Morada my cuz ordered was tasty, but a little too sweet for me.) And then we wait. And wait. And wait. And like 20 minutes later, my little niece and I trudge to the waitress and ask for more bread and I remind her of my water. She apologizes, hurries over with the water, and runs off again. C's hubby grumbles that they'll probably bring the appetizer w/ dinner again, so I guess the crappy service was not a fluke. Finally, the yucca arrives... yeeep, along w/ all the other food. Hmph. The chicken was OK, but definately prefer La Pizza Grotto's. The lomo saltado was okay, but the fries were on the side!! As any good Peruvian knows, the fries are supposed to be below the meat and veggies, so they soak up the flavor. =P Again, prefer... you get the picture. The waiter told us there would be music later that night. Cuz and I took the chance to dance (hard to find a club in Connecticut!) and went... not the best looking crowd, but we met some cool peeps and the music was good. :D"
10384,34,4,0,2/17/2014,"You have to be willing to wait. One chef and one person running the entire remainder of the restaurant. I would assume a husband and wife? Brother and sister? She was zipping around the restaurant while he cooked. I was starving by the time I brought the food home. In word ... delicious! I will definitely be going back but will give myself more time than I did tonight. It's good for groups because you can share but seriously, don't be in a rush. Oh yeah, cash only!"
5201,34,4,0,2/7/2014,slow.. but food is good.
10385,34,4,0,1/26/2014,"Great restaurant. They have two menus - one standard chinese fare and one Taiwanese. The chinese stuff is good, but the Taiwanese is GREAT! I work next door and have sampled many of the dishes. The lady who runs is is super sweet and I am consistently impressed by the quality of this place. It would be an easy 5 stars if they took credit cards. They are set up cash only for now. ˜Hope that changes soon."
10386,34,5,0,5/6/2014,I have been a vegetarian for quite a while and therefore go out to eat Chinese food a lot. ˜Overall I've been pretty satisfied with most places. But Iron Chef has made a believer of me! ˜The food is incredible! ˜The only bad thing I can say is they don't take credit cards.
10387,34,5,1,1/10/2015,"I have been her twice and had for delicious noodle soups. It is a Taiwanese restaurant which has a little different flavors than regular Chinese. The reviews will tell you it's very busy but has been very quiet at lunch when I have visited. The first time I went here I had a delicious and very clean and warm in my stomach pork noodle soup with mustard greens. It just made me happy and really want to come back. The second time I went with the waitresses suggestion of the Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup. Tons of character. Very spicy and savory. Better even than any Pho I have had. There was also a very sweet family next door. The young child was happy and silly, the husband a math professor at the University of New Haven a nice guy. The wife was from Taiwan and the owner gave him a contact. He said the food was as good as his in laws. One of the best Chinese/Asian places I have ever gone. It's worth a trip. Remember to bring cash, they are cash only. Delicious."
10388,34,5,1,1/7/2015,I love this place. ˜I'm a vegetarian and the food is fresh and cooked perfectly. ˜My only complaint: ˜They don't take credit cards. ˜It does limit the number of times I come in but if they took credit cards I'd definitely be in more often.
10389,34,5,1,12/30/2014,Real deal alert. Husband & Wife owned and operated. Husband in back wife in front. The chef is a master of his craft and the service is haphazardly charming. Will definitely be back
10390,34,5,1,12/20/2014,"We have gotten take outs from here ~10 times, although have not eaten inside. It is definitely better and the food quality more consistent than the other Chinese restaurants in Orange and West Haven. We like the Taiwanese beef noodles, Taiwanese braised pork rice, spicy beef tripe appetizer, and the twice cooked pork."
10391,34,5,1,11/18/2014,This place serves very authentic Taiwanese food! I ordered sauteed water spinach with beef in Taiwanese Sa Cha sauce and it was amazing. The vegetable dumplings were just the way my grandfather would make it. I would highly recommend this place.
10392,34,5,1,10/4/2014,"Very impressed by the authenticity of their Taiwanese food. Beef-noodle soup, stinky tofu, and fried Chinese donuts are ˜spot on! Cash only and waiting time is a little bit long. It's worth for the wait !"
10393,34,4,1,9/20/2014,authentic Taiwan food.
10394,34,4,1,9/3/2014,Probably the best Chinese restaurant in the area. ˜Their food is wonderful. ˜Only drawback is the lack of atmosphere. ˜If they could upgrade that I'd give them 5 stars
10395,34,3,1,8/19/2014,I wanted to like this place a lot but unfortunately didn't have that great of an experience. Perhaps I was expecting more but I only thought the food here were decent. Plus the fact that they were very understaffed when we were there on a Friday night we ended up having to wait about 45 minutes for our dishes to be served. I think it was probably an unexpected busy night for them where by the time we were eating almost all of the tables were full and they really only have a chef plus a server working in the back helping out. Also this place is cash only unfortunately but for us it wasn't an issue but definitely something to be aware of. The location is very conveniently close to 95 and it was easy to find. I really want to give this place another chance since they are a mom and pop style restaurant that are serving authentic TW food in a suburban CT town. I hope the next time when I have chance to visit they would be better equipped for the crowd. As for the food themselves since we were in a large non TW group I didn't really try out the traditional Taiwanese dishes that I usually do but my favorite this time were the Spicy Lamb and the Sour Fish Soup. Being a TW myself would want to come back to this place again when its not so busy to try out their traditional line up. Hopefully I can reach the same conclusion as others have written here.
10396,34,5,1,8/11/2014,"I used to go all the time in the old location and loved it. . ˜I think they closed down a few years ago because UNH wanted to use the building for a clinic and I figured we had lost a great one forever. I spotted the new location a few weeks ago and went down there tonight. I swear it seems even better than before. Taiwanese food is very different from the usual Cantonese, Szechwan, or Hunanese (?) fare and ˜should be experienced to really appreciate it's subtlety. ˜Our party of three asked for the chef to make us anything he wanted and my friends and I were really pleased with the results. Shredded pork soup with mustard greens, spicy crispy-fried short ribs, Chinese eggplant with garlic, whole fish in a really nice orange-colored sauce, and a plate of broiled short ribs with vegetables in a thick brown sauce with a hint of five-spice powder. This place must be supported so that we don't lose them again, so do your culinary duty....PS The place was spotless, the service warm and friendly, plenty of ˜parking out front."
10397,34,5,1,8/8/2014,"Had never had Taiwanese food before. ˜Found this restaurant on Yelp and decided to give it a try. ˜My husband cannot tolerate MSG and so we were delighted when the women who greeted us (Mei), offered the menu([s]--Taiwanese and more traditional Chinese) said she would make sure the dishes we ordered had no flavor enhancers. We ordered one egg roll and dumplings in peanut sauce appetizers and both were wonderful. ˜My husband had a spicy chicken dish entree and I had a lightly breaded and lightly fried fish (I think it was flounder) with wonderfully flavorful mustard greens and (I think) crisp bok choy (Mei said it was long water chestnuts). ˜Whatever it was it was absolutely delicious. We were treated as honored guests. The chef came out and said hello and the women who took care of us could not have more attentive or a nicer person. ˜The restaurant was relatively empty (it was early) but there were a number of take out orders and we didn't have long to wait for our food. ˜ I noted a comment here about the ambiance. ˜The room is immaculate and tables are nicely spaced, seating is very comfortable. ˜Yes, there was a very clean clear plastic cover on the nice table cloths but that was not terribly off-putting. If good food, nicely presented in a comfortable atmosphere is what you desire you won't go wrong coming here. We are delighted to have found Iron Chef and their charming owners and am certain we will go back many times."
10398,34,5,1,7/6/2014,"Having just moved to New Haven, I was not expecting such an authentic Taiwanese restaurant! It rivals those in Monterrey Park or Mountain View. Their pork chop rice and stinky tofu were spot on. Be sure to ask for the Taiwanese kimchee (pao choi) to go with the stinky tofu. It is more pricy compared to most taiwanese places, especially for lunch. But it's CT, so I would happily pay it. Be sure to bring cash though, no credit cards here."
10399,34,5,1,7/3/2014,"You know it is authentic when you cannot find American Chinese dishes in the menu (eg Sweet-and-Sour/General Tsao chicken/tofu/whatnot...) I loved to order take-out from them when they were in their West Haven location. Luckily my husband saw their sign at the new location and told me that they are back. I tried many of their dishes- pork chop over rice, pepper and beef, beef noodle soup, and best yet, their hot and sour soup... Their food reminds me of restaurants in Taipei a lot. As a transplant from Taiwan myself, I will say this is hands down the best Chinese/Taiwanese in New Haven COUNTY. All the others are either too salty too greasy, or just catering to people who equate Chinese food with General Tsao."
10400,34,5,1,5/6/2014,"I have been a fan of Iron Chef since they were in West Haven. ˜I am from Taiwan and know that it is often difficult to find an authentic (let alone decent) restaurant in the suburbs...so I was super stoked when I found out about this place. Now...this isn't your typical gross ""chicken with broccoli"" or fluorescent yellow egg drop soup place-the food is almost always fresh (in fact, I have called on several occasions where the chef was out in Flushing buying the produce for the week). I had a small party recently and wanted to order a boat load of food from Iron Chef. ˜I called about 3 days ahead and the staff members were super accommodating and helpful. ˜Some of the dishes ordered included Tilapia in Hot Oil, Three Cup Wine Chicken (a Taiwanese staple), Sweet Sausage with Bamboo shoots and Tofu with preserved Eggs. ˜My guests enjoyed every dish (except the stinky tofu-that was only enjoyed by yours truly). ˜ The only downside is that they (still) do not take cards and the food can sometimes take a while (I think there is only 1 chef in the back). ˜Plus, this is not the type of place you go for ambiance. As long as those things do not bother you, Iron Chef is still highly recommended for anyone who appreciates good Chinese/Taiwanese cuisine."
10401,34,5,1,4/26/2014,"Quick, pleasant service in a small space with an authentic Taiwanese feel. Yes, the tables are wrapped in plastic and the restaurant doesn't have much of an ambiance but I don't seek out Taiwanese restaurants for a romantic or relaxing evening. Plus, these are signs of authenticity. We were staying in a hotel nearby on our visit from NJ where the Asian food is good and plentiful. We ordered the scallion pancakes, chicken over rice, Taiwanese sausage with bamboo shoots, and the pea shoots. Everything came out quickly and nothing was too salty or with too much sauce. Would definitely stop by here again if we're ever in the area."
10402,34,5,1,4/18/2014,"I LOVE Iron Chef. ˜I was so sad when they closed their old location. ˜When Mei (the owner) called to tell them they open their current store front, I was so excited that I almost abandoned my half made dinner to go there to eat! The Taiwanese menu is very authentic - I took my parents who were visiting from Taiwan and they agreed as well! ˜My go to dish is the Noodle w. Meat Sauce (Ja Jang Mian - Taiwanese menu item T37 or A3). ˜I tried many of their dishes and none of them disappoint. ˜If you are looking for a rice dish to try, i recommend the Beef Stew Over Rice (item A16). ˜It is on the higher price point, but the flavor is amazing, IMHO. ˜And Chinese Meatball in Brown Sauce (A29) is my splurge. And don't overlook the appetizers! ˜If you like spicy food and don't mind trying something new, the Spicy Beef Tendons is really great. ˜Oh, and if you are not too hungry, and just want a little something to eat, the Taiwan Style Burger is really great (it comes with crushed peanut powders so don't get that if you are allergic!). During the week, it's only the Chef and Mei (husband and wife) so the food doesn't come out as fast, but I take it as a good thing - the food is always made fresh and they don't just use the same sauce for all the dishes! ˜On the weekend, they have a little help, but they also have more customers, so there may still be a wait. ˜But I promise, it's worth it! And don't forget, cash only!"
10403,34,3,1,3/14/2014,Pros: Food tastes good Spacious Reasonable price Cons: Cash only Slow Doesn't feel like a restaurant Tables are wrapped in plastic...
10404,34,4,1,2/6/2014,"CASH ONLY!! I grew up in Taiwan and came to US at age 26 in 2000 so I'm old-style Taiwanese. Today, I went there to see what they have to offer that are truely Chinese and just realized that they only accept cash when I got there. With only $13 cash with me, I ordered the Special Pork Shop Over Rice (???????) to go. ˜I finished the pork chop during my drive back to work!! it just smell so good and also taste as the way I like it. It comes with plenty of spinch and bean sprout and some minced pork sauce. Not exactly the version I had when I was in high school but a healthier version. (The minced pork sauce doesn't seem salty at all maybe just because the pork chop has heavier flavor. ) So it passed my first trial and I will definitely go back again with more cash when I have a chance. :) Four star just because I only tried one dish and not sure about other dishes."
10405,34,5,1,1/9/2014,Good food and nice place. Recommend. Will definitely go again.
10406,34,5,1,1/8/2014,"Iron Chef has spot-on Taipei-style food, which is so hard to find around here! My family is Taiwanese and we love going here together. Lots of authentic/exotic dishes on the Taiwanese menu, but they have a standard Chinese food menu as well. Our favorites are the Three Cup Wine Chicken (san bei ji), the shredded pork with mustard greens soup, the homemade dumplings, the minced pork on rice, whatever vegetable they have on special, and a new addition: the fried ""stinky tofu"" (""chou doufu"" a Taiwanese specialty, but not for the faint of heart or the unindoctrinated--don't say I didn't warn you! But it is so good and addictive if you can get over the smell-I can eat a whole plate by myself! My husband won't touch the stuff, though, but at least he is willing to put up with the smell so I can enjoy it at the table :) ) The owners are very friendly and pride themselves on quality and fresh ingredients-no MSG or greasy food here! A wonderful selection of all kinds of Taiwanese delicacies, but they also have a regular Chinese food menu as well, which is also top notch, for those less familiar with Taiwanese food (which is generally lighter/cleaner, but less familiar to most people). We love the food here-so authentic-and go every chance we get. We were so sad when their old location closed, and so glad when this new location opened on the Post Road. It's a treat to have a taste of the old country so close by! (Cash-only the last time we were there.)"
10407,34,5,1,11/24/2013,Awesome Taiwanese food in orange! ˜My wife and I were so glad to find this place. ˜It is a family run business. ˜The lady was very sweet and friendly. ˜Food was tasty and authentic. ˜We will be back often!
5208,35,2,0,1/19/2014,"We used to enjoy this place a lot more when it was AJ's Breakfast and Lunch. ˜The food was just better, and now, there's this weird vibe like you're eating at someone's house and everyone else there is a visiting friend who they know, except for you."
10408,35,1,1,11/16/2014,Awful! No one in here and it's a 30 minute wait to get the food once the order is placed! Messed up and made gluten free pancakes instead of the French toast... Seriously slow and the omelette wasn't even an omelette. Would much rather go across town to breakfast nook and wait in line for a more delicious meal than this!
10409,35,1,1,7/25/2014,Food was all around ehh.. save yourself the disappointment and find a better place to eat.
10410,35,5,1,12/20/2013,"Ideal place for breakfast. Leave your gluten fee, calorie counting friends at home cause this is a diner in the truest sense of the word. Omlettes and egg combos are never disappointing."
10411,35,4,1,11/30/2013,"I ate here for brunch once, as I live down the street and drive by often. ˜They do a good job of advertising out front with signs and specials posted by the street. ˜So I ventured in one Sunday in the late morning after doing a hike nearby and having built up an appetite. ˜It is a neighborhood style, family-run place and most of the staff are relatives of the owner. ˜The waitress told me how much work her family put into re-doing the place as the previous owner of the place let it go. ˜ Anyway, I sat at the counter and had a short stack of pancakes (2) with an add-on of fresh strawberries and whipped cream. ˜Also had an iced coffee. ˜Even with the short stack I was only able to finish 1 pancake. ˜Very filling but still very light and fluffy. ˜ Overall, a decent meal at a very reasonable price. ˜The bill was under $10. ˜Maybe next time I will try one of their lunch sandwiches or salads, if not breakfast again!"
10412,35,2,1,11/17/2013,"Not impressed with this place at all. The service was ok, it took a while for the waitress to check in with us and if you don't know the difference between hash browns and home fries then you should be fired. The food needed salt and pepper to mask the bland taste.. Overall first and last time I will ever eat at this place."
10413,35,4,1,10/16/2013,"This place is designed as a classic diner and clearly has regulars for breakfast. The people are easy going and super nice. Breakfast is served all day, but they also have incredibly thick, ginormous pies. I wonder how big the slices are! I'll have to try them another time. There are plenty of cheap options. For instance, the 2 Eggs, home fries, toast, and bacon/sausage/ham option is only $3.95. A short stack of Chocolate or Blueberry Pancakes is only $4.75. Tons of great options. I opted for the Philly Omelet (served with home fries and toast, $7.50). Filling, quickly served, and delicious! Only one bathroom stall, but it's a big bathroom. Plenty of seating. There's a small area for parking outside. Just be careful not to drive too quickly when you first come here - otherwise, you might pass by before you know it! Also, make sure you have the right street name - it's Quinnipiac AVE, not ST or BLVD - one of the other options leads you into the parking lot of the back of an apartment complex. Speaking from experience..."
10414,35,5,1,1/7/2013,"Great breakfast, huge portions, best in North Haven"
10415,36,2,0,4/16/2014,The most expensive ceviche that I ever had in my entire life. ˜$23 ceviche mixto...How much are the pound of fish in the fish market? $100 per pound?
10372,36,5,1,6/23/2014,"Great food and service. ˜The Peruvian food in Hartford is best here. ˜The restaurant is new but I heard the cook has worked in a famous restaurant chain. ˜The Best dishes I recommend are ""combinado de chicharron"" for breakfast and ceviche micro for lunch or dinner . ˜ One cant go wrong with this plates. ˜Also the restaurant is having amazing ambience during the World Cup."
10416,36,1,1,1/10/2014,"I can't review the food, as we didn't get any. We passed by the waiter on our way in--he did not greet us. ˜We seated ourselves--he looked over our way several times, but made no move to bring menus or water. ˜There was a large table of enthusiastic Peruvians, which was festive. ˜However, after 10 minutes of no greeting and no menus even though the waiter was not busy, we threw in the towel, as we needed to get to a movie."
10417,36,4,1,8/9/2013,"A few centuries ago in South America, Spanish kitchen met Native American, African, Asian and even Italian. Spanish Viceroys and Dukes started demanding specialties using ingredients as diverse as the natural regions found in Peru. This is how one of the most amazing and diverse Kitchens in the world was born. For a few dollars, Vista Alegre promises not to leave anyone hungry. Portions are hefty & packed with lots of flavor. Definitely worth the try. Good luck Alegre family!"
10418,36,4,1,7/29/2013,"Took the family to the Peruvian Independence Day Celebration this Sunday. Got there just in time. The place was crowded 1/2 hour after we arrived. The most striking thing about Vista Alegre is the ambiance. It is extremely friendly and accomodating. And they have a nice patio. The food was excellent and the menu extensive. The owner brought my father-in-law and me each a Peruvian soccer shirt and baseball cap. My wife is from Lima, Peru and I am the tag-along Gringo. I can tell you, this place rocks!! This is our new go-to place for Peruvian food."
10419,36,4,1,6/24/2013,"Not every Thursday late morning that I am on Franklin avenue with my family looking randomly for a place to have lunch...But here we were and there was Vista Alegre...and the match was made. ˜It's been a while since I've had Peruvian and was excited to expand my horizons a bit. ˜ Our very friendly waiter seated us underneath a tent out on the front deck overlooking Frankin Ave. ˜Not the most picturesque setting (there is a lovely Family Dollar right across the street :)), but it was a beautiful day and great to sit outside and enjoy it. ˜We were thinking of enjoying a nice morning cocktail, but were informed that they were still trying to get their liquor license in order and could not serve yet. ˜They did say that we could BYOB in the mean-time and would advise a would be patron to call ahead, double check on BYOB, and bring a nice bottle with you for the meal. Waiter was awesome and took a lot of time to explain the menu items and the backstory of the place. ˜He is from Peru and had lots of tips to share. ˜Also gave some backstory on the various Peruvian establishments we see popping up in South Hartford. As for the food, most of us ordered a Chaufa platter (fried rice mixed with meat) and my wife ordered the ceviche platter. ˜Waiter commented that Peruvian restaurants are known for large portions and he wasn't kidding! ˜I can usually polish off whatever is put in front of me at a restaurant and was only able to make it halfway through my dish. ˜If I had to offer a tip to the owners, you may want to go with a lunch menu that halves the portions and prices ($14 for lunch is a bit much), but you are definitely getting 2, or maybe 3, meals out of your entr?e. ˜Even my wife's ceviche was over the top with the amount of seafood they provided. ˜It was all very good. Quick note / tip: ˜When you read the menu ingredients for Chaufa, you might say 'This sounds a lot like a fried rice entr?e from a Chinese restaurant' and you would be right. ˜It is very similar except for the seasoning they use on the meat requested. ˜I only say this as a family member was slightly disappointed as she was looking for something more unique to Peru and felt she could have gotten this elsewhere. ˜I knew what I was getting myself into and loved every bite of it. While we just came upon this place by happenstance, my wife and I agreed that we will definitely come back for a second round."
10420,36,4,1,6/22/2013,"Wonderful service, comfortable restaurant with outdoor seating. Return visit just as tasty as the first. Been to many Peruvian restaurants and I must say this ranks with the best. Great selection, generous portions served hot and attractively presented. Waitress always ready to please and bring to the table whatever is requested. Hope Vista Alegre is supported because I would hate to see them close."
10379,36,4,1,6/1/2013,"Came here with my father because he checks out all the new Peruvian restaurants that open up. Came in a Saturday and it was not empty but not full. The space itself is pretty small but nice and decorated in that typical Peruvian way. They have outdoor seating on a nice patio and serve bread with Peruvian aji or hot sauce before your meal which is typical of Peruvian restaurants. Now I came in not really hungry so I got the caldo de gallina or chicken soup (even though its so hot outside!). Food came out so fast! And everything was delicious. My soup was hot and had a nice piece of chicken thigh (I hate when they give you leg, but thats a personal preference). I asked for lime to add to my soup and that also came out promptly and my dad got the cau cau was good. Our waitress was extremely friendly and great on service so we were happy for that! Only draw back, no vegetarian options. Not even a small salad or quinoa but I'll make that suggestion hopefully this will change. Overall great place and would recommend and come back!"
10421,37,4,0,7/21/2014,"good food, but the area not so good, not so safe at night"
10422,37,4,1,9/2/2014,Over the years I've grown skeptic over chinese food with many Asiatic people bringing over their home lands dietary customs I never want to be someone who can say I've eaten rat. BUT OMG I LOVE Amins. Always fresh deliciously seasoned chicken. Never bad. I suggest to anyone. I don't eat anything but halal now.
6383,37,4,1,7/27/2014,"Amin's has some the best, clean, halal food around. I'd give them 5 stars for food alone! But the service, it's always shaky. It depends on what kind of mood they're in. They have their rude moments in how they deal with customers and they have their shockingly good moods some days as well. So the 4 stars are because the service isn't consistent and while i don't go all of the time, I've gone frequently enough to notice that they continuously go up on their prices...a quarter here, 50 cents there. I think that's ridiculous!! Especially knowing they don't deliver. Ever! Other than that, the food is always on point!"
10423,37,5,1,11/18/2012,"Ok! Now I've seen it all. Halal Chinese food and I have to say this is the best Chinese food that I have had in along time. The wings are huge and fresh. The food is cooked to order and not precooked like some of the Chinese restaurants do with their Chinese rice. Mind you this is halal and according to the Islamic law it has to not only be slaughtered a certain kind of way it also can't be raised or feed any impurities( steroids and what have you). I recommend the wings and the egg foo yung which is ""slamming"". Everything is packed full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Amina has several locations throughout central jersey. You can't fail with it."

10425,38,2,0,5/25/2013,I used to love this place the husband and wife that was running it made the best pizza hands down. I went there the other day and the guy there now dropped pepperoni on the floor and picked up and put it on the pizza. I walked out without ordering. It's too bad im really going to miss this place.
10426,38,1,1,7/18/2013,"$13.33 for a party pizza 40 slices, of course i wasn't looking for this to be the best pizza in the world for this price. But first its not $13.33 its $15.99 for just cheese and almost $20 for a pepperoni and $25 for a meat lovers.... it came out to almost $50 for 2 pizza's... they did bring the pizza to the car they get one star for that, curb side delivery and she placed it in the back seat. However, this was the worst pizza I have ever tasted, it was greasy like the pizza was sitting in a pool of grease and to top it off the crust was not cooked all the way it was raw and doughy... find a little Cesar's or Domino's this is not a must have... I give this place six months to be in business at the most."
10427,2509,1,0,2/17/2010,"Food is OK But the service is THE WORST EVER!!!! ˜I went 2 x and bboth times I waited 30 minutes for one wrap. ˜Then I ordered for delivery today and they ˜took 2 hours!!! ˜Really, 2 hours. ˜The worst ever"
10428,2509,4,0,9/8/2014,I love Better! I literally have lunch from there at least twice a week. So fresh and delicious. Their hummus is amazing!
10429,2509,4,0,7/3/2014,"I live directly down the block but only ate here about 4 times. The wraps are sooo delicious. Chinatown, chris' special, and lets not forget the delicious barbeque sauce they have. Its fruity and tangy, to die for. I would say i wish it wasnt as overpriced as it is, but that doesnt stop me. Awesome place!"
10430,2509,4,0,3/9/2009,Great food and smoothies. They also have good service. A little high on prices but still a great place to get something to eat.
10431,2509,4,0,6/8/2007,I am a Better Gourmet Kitchen addict. ˜Please help me! lol I eat here every day. ˜its the only place on Staten Island that I feel like I'm getting a healthy balanced meal. ˜There are other health food places but the food was so dry. Plus the workers are so happy and helpful. ˜its such a nice atmosphere. ˜the music is cool and the decor is great too. ˜i feel like im in soho.
10432,2509,5,0,8/4/2014,"Finally got around to join yelp and this had to be the first place I give my 5 stars to!! I am an avid health food eater - this is my #1 choice on Staten Island! Besides the food being on point for the past 8 years of me eating there, the staff is always so friendly and helpful! The place itself is just so cool. ˜I would rather wait 15 mins for a wrap that is FRESH and not pre-cooked (collecting bacteria). ˜The juice is literally dripping off of my wrap! Veggies are always fresh, salads always on point. ˜If I could give Better 10 stars I would. ˜Go to Mc Donald's for fast food - go to Better for GOOD food! Keep doing it guys!!! LOVE IT"
10433,2509,5,0,3/29/2014,"This place has great food! And it is so healthy for you! Prices are great, if you want cheaper food then eat processed fast good. Better gourmet Kitchen is delicious"
10434,2509,5,0,1/7/2014,Delish!!! Was looking for a local place close-by (was in the area for work) and found this on yelp. Saw it got decent reviews and served healthy options. Gave it a shot and was NOT disappointed!! Ordered the western egg white omelet wrap with a side of turkey bacon. Yum!! I'll be returning when I'm in the area for sure...
10435,2509,5,0,6/7/2010,great place to eat expensive but good
10436,2509,5,0,10/31/2008,"better gourmet is awesome. ˜during these hard times and conservative spending habits, I found a place that I can get a great healthy well balanced meal for under 10 bucks! ˜the ambiance is trendy, cool lounge music plays in the background, good looking crowd, friendly staff and comfortable decor!! ˜i loveeee the Buffalo chicken salad with low fat blue cheese dressing..I highly recommend this spot - great for chillen with your girls...It is across from my gym and so close to a few other gyms. ˜i like sitting outside in the summer also - great spot!"

10438,2509,5,1,1/9/2015,Chuck the fast food and get into shape. I've lost 30 lbs eating better at this place for lunch everyday. I can't believe eating healthy can taste this good. Try them out!
9474,2509,2,1,11/30/2014,"I really wanted to like this place. It's nice to know that there are some healthy food spots to check out in the neighborhood where one lives. we decided to check out this restaurant on a night when we were too busy to cook. I noticed that the place was going to close in about 20 minutes and figured we would get some takeout. The minute we walked in we were informed that we wouldn't be able to sit down because they were wrapping up for the night. While I understand that they were going to close, it was quite rude. I ordered the Thai steak with peanut sauce and brown rice, my husband ordered the bison burgers. We were both real disappointed with the quality of the food. We need to add a lot of additional flavors when we got home to simply swallow what it was that we purchased. Even though I could walk here if I want to, I likely will never enter this place again. I really wanted to like it, I really believe in supporting local business. But the service lacked and the food lacked in flavor."
10439,2509,4,1,11/15/2014,"Was passing through Staten Italy and jumped off 440 to Victory Blvd. looking for something to snack on and came across this little restaurant. It seems similar to Muscle Maker Grill in the sense that they have healthy cooking in mind, not sure if this place is independent or franchise owned. Ordered a chicken fajita wrap to go and would go back in a heartbeat to get another. This thing was big and loaded with chicken, saut?ed onions and peppers, and guacamole. It was delicious, cooked to perfection wrapped in a whole wheat wrap. What I expected to be a snack for the road turned surprisingly into a meal that kept me full for hours, definitely a place worth checking out."
10440,2509,3,1,7/30/2014,"Good food, large menu, staff has been friendly, ˜but service is just too slow for whatever reason. Even at the height of lunch, 20+ minutes for a wrap is kind of silly. I come back for the variety, but make sure you have some time."
10441,2509,4,1,1/13/2014,"I really love this place because the food is tasty while healthy which is rare. They have a lot of great choices. Some of my favorites are 'the tex Mex salad' w/ grilled chicken). The salad has romaine lettuce, corn, black beans, lowfat cheese, guacamole, and I ask for grilled chicken YUM! It comes with a side of light ranch dressing, and i only have to use very little because there's already a lot of flavor btw the cheese, guac etc. Another one of my favorites are the spinach quesadillas. A guilt free take on the quesadilla. It's made with whole wheat bread, spinach, low-fat cheese, I ask for grilled chicken. It comes with a side of salsa, and guacamole. I like to put a little of salsa, and guacamole on each quesadilla. Again, nice portion, it looks like a pizza pie. I always have leftovers for lunch the next day when I've ordered dinner here (particularly with these selections). Whoever came up with this idea is a genius, and I'm sorry I didn't get to it first! Can't wait for the third location!!!! We needed this on Staten Island!!"
10442,2509,5,1,1/1/2014,Try the protein brownie! It is AMAZING. Make sure you have milk with it.
10443,2509,2,1,9/5/2013,"I would love to say that this place is wonderful. ˜I can't say it's terrible because of one bad order, but they should certainly pay attention to what is heading out of the kitchen. ˜The veggie burger is basically just a rice patty. ˜There were no actual vegetables in it. ˜The special was a veggie burger Parmesan which came out as rice on a wheat roll. ˜My son's veggie burger was delicious, but that didn't help me out much."
10444,2509,3,1,7/13/2013,I use to eat here all of the time no issues. ˜In the last 6 mos or maybe a little more every time I order a steak dish like 3rd ave or something similar I get sick. ˜First time I thought was a fluke. ˜Ordered the same this week and got sick as a dog. ˜My friend gets the pizza or quesadillas and got sick both times from the cheese. ˜I really hope they go back to the way they were. ˜Please please if you changed food vendors go back to them.
10445,2509,3,1,6/4/2013,I was pretty skeptical about healthy food (pizza) being good but to my amazement the pizza here is very good and it doesn't give me the sluggish feeling after I eat it. ˜I definitely would recommend the margarita pie with turkey meatball Only reason I did not give a higher rating is because 2 of the 4 times I ordered from here they did not have a shipment of chicken or turkey meatball so I couldn't really order
10446,2509,3,1,5/18/2013,"I happen to like the Hylan location ""better"" haha I crack myself up. ˜I like the Hail Caesar wrap and the Greek wrap the most. ˜I've tried a bunch of things and everything is fresh and pretty tasty for a healthy choice. ˜The berry flavored smoothies are good too. ˜I have to say I placed a huge order with my coworkers last week and the guy taking my order took it fast and precisely with no issues, I was so impressed."
10447,2509,1,1,5/18/2013,"I like Better, but sometimes I really want to hate them. It depends who's working that day, because I've ordered 2 items and it's taken an hour and a half, but then I'll have a 12 item delivery and it's there in 30 minutes. I don't want to go against my gender or anything but I sometimes worry about the women who answer the phones. I pray my order comes right. They're one of the few healthy choices for meals on Staten Island, and the portions are good so I'll be back."
10448,2509,4,1,5/18/2013,"Close to work, this is the perfect place for hunger and convenience. They deliver and you can order to pick up or dine in. The portions are huge! The salads are more than filling. They have multiple options for all kinds of foodies. I recently had the Cookie Crunch smoothie and Jack Talk Thai salad. The smoothie was delicious, but slightly watery at the end. The salad was good, but I prefer the Big Hawaii or the Tex Mex. The staff is very friendly and on the ball. They work well and quick! Service with a smile is what I'm all about. Great place for lunch!"
10449,2509,2,1,4/5/2013,"Came here to try to eat a healthy meal, I failed. 1. No hard boiled eggs. 2. Only type of lettuce is Romaine. 3. The employees don't know the difference between oil and vinegar and balsamic vinaigrette. When asked them if the Italian dressing was creamy they replied no, guess what, it was. Threw my salad out and walked out."
10450,2509,4,1,1/20/2013,"Little disappointed lately... Buffalo chicken salad is always decent - can be mild or super hot though... Very let down by the Greek wrap. All lettuce, skimpy amount of chicken and barley any cheese or sauce. ˜Would go back- just not for a wrap."
10451,2509,4,1,12/13/2012,We ordered take-out from here every night while in the area on business. The food is fresh and delicious and the menu is extensive. I'm going to miss the chocolate covered strawberry smoothies when I leave. The portions are gigantic. One salad or wrap could easily be split with someone else. I wish I had one of these in my neighborhood back home. The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars is because of the bland dining area and there isn't a lot of parking. Don't let that stop you from getting food from here though. They also deliver to nearby hotels.
10452,2509,4,1,11/17/2012,"Great food. Simple, healthy, and tastes great! Fast service, friendly staff."
10453,2509,3,1,8/13/2012,Pretty good little price but it's healthy !
10454,2509,4,1,1/14/2012,"I absolutely love this place! It gives you a healthy option for anything that you're craving, from pancakes to burgers! Also, for the price you get a lot of food. The wraps are literally bursting. The protein shakes are delicious and huge too! Try the Nutty Professor!"
10455,2509,4,1,11/16/2011,"I love Better. I used to bother my boyfriend about coming here all the time, and I'm glad that by some twist of fate he likes it now too! I really dig the Texas Hold Em wrap because of the blackberry BBQ sauce, and the Latin Lover, which is the closest thing on the Island, in my opinion, to my dearly beloved Chipotle. He always gets the Philly Cheese Steak as a wrap, and it's STELLAR. Solid smoothies, and their giant salads are worth the price."
10456,2509,4,1,10/16/2011,4 star for the Ahi Tuna wrap. ˜It is the best. ˜The place is pretty expensive but the tuna is worth it.
10457,2509,2,1,5/14/2011,"I only tried this place for the first time the other day as I'm on a bit of a health kick recently. I've been frequenting the new Muscle Maker Grill across the Gothels Bridge in Linden a lot lately and thought this would be a good alternative. The portions are big, and it was pretty tasty but 30 minutes later, well lets just say I was out of action for about 15-20 minutes!! I'll probably give this place another chance to redeem itself in the future, but for now they get only 2 stars from me."
10458,2509,5,1,3/5/2011,Great idea to keep people eating better and healthy !
10459,2509,4,1,9/1/2010,Outstanding wraps! Huge!!!! Real health food not pretend wanna be like Fuel!! Homemade quality taste! ˜Don't be put off by the prices....as they do reflect the food quality of this establishment!
10460,2509,4,1,3/5/2010,"I've been reluctant to go here, just because I'm only over here around dinner time and never thought I'd be full from it. ˜Half way through sharing a salad and a wrap, I learned that my thinking was way off. ˜The Full House salad was massive... and is well worth the $9 for it. ˜The Shroomin' wrap was realllly good. ˜The chicken was kind of dry, but the wrap itself was huge and well wrapped. I had just had a Muscle Maker wrap for lunch and wasn't expecting to enjoy yet another wrap for dinner... mistaken again. Good job, Better. ˜I will be back."
10461,2509,4,1,12/2/2009,"I now live in California....and I wish we had a place that served healthy yummy food like this, there!!"
10462,41,1,0,9/22/2013,"I find it odd that a pizza place in the new haven area is only open two days a week???? There's enough competition and colleges in the area for them to be open 6-7 days a week! Overall the pizza was fine but I have had better. The honey crust is a nice touch, but any restaurant can do that and to top it off the waitress had to come back over a few minutes after we ordered to ask if we wanted it. If that is something that makes you ""unique"" then wouldn't you know right then and there to ask your customers?? The menu is extremely limited and overpriced. It's also on a piece of paper which shows they don't care. They have one size pizza and one size salad. If I wanted a small salad before pizza I'd have to order the $9 salad that could feed a family of 4. This place had two tables filled which makes it suspicious why on a Saturday night there was almost no one there. The decor is just OKAY and the fact that they won't have any live bands for another month makes it even stranger. I don't see this place lasting long because they can't even open or re-open properly. The wait staff was nice but seeing the girl at the register in her iPhone looking bored solidified that there's not much going on here."
10463,41,1,0,9/14/2013,"So I came back to blues, exactly a week later (they're only open fri & sat) and had a completely different experience. ˜The pizza ill tasting and really not edible. ˜Completely different from my first experience. ˜I must agree with the commenter below that being open 2 days a week the ingredients must not be staying fresh. ˜I guess what I came in a week later they were on their way out! ˜I won't be coming back until they're open full time"
10464,41,5,0,9/14/2013,Went to Blues the 1st time ever. Pizza was excellent the place was clean and very open. Cant wait till they get live music back. The owner took the time to come over and great us. The wait staff was very professional. ˜I would definitely go back again.
10465,41,5,0,6/11/2013,BLUES is Back!! Now OPEN Friday and Saturday!!!
10466,41,5,1,11/9/2013,Food was awesome. Good atmosphere and loved the honey crust pizza. Highly recommend the BBQ pizza. A must check- out!!
5168,41,3,1,9/29/2013,"Pepes has its clam pizza, Bar has its mashed potato pizza, and Blues Pizza has its honey crust pizza. Honey crust pizza, you say? Take a look at my photo to see what I'm talking about. They drizzle the outer circumference of their crust with a thin bead of honey. Yes, honey. If Winnie the Pooh were a bear living in Hamden he'd probably be at Blues Pizza every night getting extra honey on his crust. The problem with that scenario is not Winnie the Pooh living in Hamden, but the fact that this business isn't open 7 days a week. It's only open on Friday and Saturday nights. Yea, it's kinda strange if you ask me. But hey, whatever floats their boat. Maybe the owner has a regular 9 to 5 job during the week. The pizza is OK. It's really thin and could use a more stringy type of mozzarella cheese. I'm guessing my cheese congealed the second it left the oven. Also, the pizza is kinda pricey at $12 for a 14"" pie especially considering the pie is super light and weighs more like a small at other pizzerias. The building is a converted garage/warehouse and it's decorated very nicely (its looks are deceiving from the outside). There's a small stage for musical acts on Saturday nights. The way the owner described it to me was that it was for ""showcase"" acts. Showcase = performers don't get paid. Which is fine because it seems like a cool place to hang on a Saturday night to sip a few brews. The downside to that idea is that for a warehouse type environment the brews seem kinda pricey. For example, $5 and $6 for Corona and Peroni bottles respectfully. Another downside is that the menu is super limited. Besides pizza, they offer only calamari, salad, and mozzarella sticks."
10467,41,1,1,7/19/2013,"After finding out Blue's reopened I was excited to place an order for two pies. I remember them having really great pizza before they closed a few yrs back. Anyways, when i arrived there and saw they were only opened on Fridays and Saturdays I became suscipicious about how fresh there ingredients were. I got my pizza's home and BOY they looked sorrry! The cheese wasnt fully cooked, the sauce was nasty and they use cheap sausage that looks like pieces of ˜jimmy dean sausage. And not to mention the price! Can you say overpriced?! $30 for two smalls with two toppings! Was very dissapointed and will definetly not return."
10468,41,3,1,6/25/2013,"Blues has RE-OPENED! ˜Fridays and Saturdays for now. I was in last weekend and tried the pies - they have an excellent apizza with a light coating of honey on the crusts. ˜I tried the pepperoni, which was very good. ˜ Apparently they have bands in on Saturdays, and the space, which is huge, would easily accomodate a big band. ˜The decor is very music-oriented, with a big mural on the far wall depicting major blues and jazz artists. ˜ Word seems to be slowly getting out. ˜It's definitely worth a try!"
10469,41,3,1,12/22/2009,blues is no more
10470,41,5,1,5/4/2006,"They specialize in honey crust, their white pizza pie is topped with parmegiano and garlic, red pie with sauce and mozzarella, yum. Their topings are anchivies, chicken, meatballs, italian sausage, fresh basil, fresh tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, green peppers, and anything else you wish for. The honey is optional but it's quite nice if you are craving for something new and different, they only do the edge and don't wollop it on, just very subtly brush a little bit on. Besides great pizza you may have hot or mild wings, desserts, beer soft drinks or vino. It's not elegant at all you can comfortably go in jeans and a nice shirt. The dining is family style, three rows of tables set up length wise along the dining room. There is a bar to sit at and a big screen tv. One thing I really like about this place is that they also have live music. A ˜live big band playing from 8PM to 11PM on Monday nights. but I just hate when people have live entertainment and come to stare at the tv??? P.S. No big band on the memorial weekend though, just letting you know so you don't ˜plan to go and there is no ˜music. Lately my sweatheart has been joining them and singing the standards, the whole place comes alive when he sings, everyone is very happy and people request their favorite songs. Really worth checking them out. Hugs. Kat"
10471,42,5,0,9/23/2012,"TAKES CASH ONLY. Very affordable place with a plethora of different types of hot dogs and cheese steaks to choose from. They also are the one of the few restaurants that sells ""jarritos"" which are delicious Mexican sodas. I keep on telling myself that since it's all natural sugar it somehow makes it better for me. So far they sell them in Pineapple, lime, fruit punch, mango, and grape fruit. Now, before you go for the safe flavors I will tell you from personal experience that Pineapple and Grapefruit are easily the best flavors. The Pineapple is tart and refreshing and the Grapefruit...um it tastes nothing like grapefruit but has a very light citrusy flavor to it. ˜As for hot dogs, D makes a really nice sauerkraut and mustard with chopped onions and peppers on top, I would also go with the Jersey cheesesteak, and the chili dog. I just uploaded their menu so you can see for yourself."
10472,43,1,0,10/9/2012,"My Cuban friend and I dined here recently, and she debunked any notion that this place serves Cuban food. ˜The food was tasteless, not authentic, and over-priced! ˜The menu might say it's cuban, but take it from two women that have lived in Miami - this place is ripping people off by saying they're cuban! ˜The ""ropa vieja"" she had was not real flank steak, they're using brisket - and fatty brisket at that. ˜The black beans were bland - no seasoning at all. ˜The service was okay - not great or welcoming. ˜At times I felt the server could have cared less that we were there. ˜The flan was from a mix, and the check for two with one drink each was over $75.00! ˜For Cuban food? ˜We've had better in NYC for way less! ˜Save your money! ˜Not worth it!"
10473,43,1,0,3/30/2011,"I really wanted to like this restaurant. For one, I love Cuban food-- delicious sauces, arroz y frijoles, ropa vieja, pollo con ajo, etc. Secondly, I pass by this restaurant every day of my life and have always planned for a quick s'wing through to try it. But unfortunately, it was a let down in every way. To start, the flavors were lackluster and the servings are incredibly tiny. I mean, they were not gag-me disgusting but just nothing really special. What was a bit special was the price tag-- neither my date nor I knocked back a single glass of sangria or mojito and we still ended up with a sixty dollar check for two entrees and one appetizer. If we were in NY, Miami or LA, this meal wouldn't have run us even $20. Rarely do I go to a restaurant and feel, wow, I was just robbed but today I keep feeling my pocket to assure my wallet itself is still in there. I have even signed up for a Yelp account in order to voice my opinion of this totally unfair restaurant and recommend that anyone considering coming here simply skip it. Run to the nearest grocery store, grab some plantains, a can of black beans, some onion and garlic, a lime, some green peppers and a breast of chicken or some some stewing beef... Google a few cuban recipes and you'll have something of equal or better quality for under ten bucks. I know you don't think you're much of a chef, but I have faith in you! Also, having tried SDC, I know you--whoever you are--can do just as well for a fraction of the cost. This place along with its nuevo latino neighbor Ay Salsa are taking advantage of their position as the sole purveyors of ""south of the border"" island cooking in the area. And Yale yuppies don't seem to mind that they're getting ripped off for decent but not exceptional food. Is ignorance bliss or do they really have that much cash?"
10474,43,2,0,3/11/2013,I don't get this place. ˜I like the set up and no nonsense decor and even the little bar BUT the bathroom across the kitchen where there aren't the cleanliest chefs... seriously - block the sites from the kitchen. ˜It would let me know that there is at least an illusion of a clean work space.
10475,43,2,0,8/20/2010,It's OK place for casual dining. Not for special occasion. Food was simple. I had better Cuban food in other places. Service was good and prompt....but cooking.... I wish we stopped at turkish restaurant a block down from that place.
10476,43,2,0,3/27/2010,"BLECH. As a caveat, I'm a vegetarian, and as such, probably cannot partake in the better aspects of Soul de Cuba. The black bean soup was so salty as to verge on inedible, and the salad soggy and tasteless with semi-rotten avocados. There were only 2 tables full in the restaurant, but it took forever to get any attention."
10477,43,4,0,1/24/2014,Their salmon is immaculate and their tres leches is yum yum yummmm !
10478,43,4,0,4/30/2013,Went there for Restaurant Week. Good food and service.
10479,43,4,0,3/17/2013,"Yum! Love the tostones appetizer and the sangria. ˜Fun place, great music, and awesome food. ˜Get there early as it is a tiny little gem of a restaurant...not much seating but very charming.

10480,43,4,0,8/6/2012,Very good food and drinks!!!
10481,43,4,0,7/18/2012,"Stopped in for Sunday lunch. Decided on the Ropa Vieja & it was amazing. Also had the Tres Leches for dessert which as also delicious. Will be back soon to try other dishes. The staff was great. Some might take issue with the space but for lunch it was comfortable. I would make reservations for dinner, if at all possible."
10482,43,4,0,3/19/2012,"My daughter and her husban took me out for my birthday and we went to Soul de Cuba Cafe, oh what a treat, this is a small place but what it lacks in space a makes up with great food, it also has a small menu, but here what counts is quality and great, you ˜tasting food,"

10484,43,4,0,12/15/2011,Unique. ˜Enjoyed the food and it is very reasonably priced. ˜Would go back.
10485,43,4,0,7/29/2011,"One of my favorite places in New Haven -- friendly staff, cheap but tasty food -- ˜good drinks. ˜Go!"
10486,43,4,0,10/27/2010,"Awesome place. ˜Great food, friendly staff and reasonable prices. ˜Would highly recommend it! ˜While not everything on the menu is traditional, they have enough tried and true recipes, mixed with some really creative dishes. ˜The staff was particularly attentive and went out of their way to be friendly and accommodating, which seems harder to find nowadays. ˜Try it and you won't be disappointed! Highly recommended!"
10487,43,4,0,10/14/2010,"Me and my husband ate here a few weeks ago. Really enjoyed trying something new. We had the Yuca fries as an appertizer. They were pretty simple but surprisingly good. I expected a dry texture but they werent at all. For my meal I ordered the ""chicken soul de cuba"" ˜breaded chicken cutlets with a slight coconuty taste. it was toped tasty fruit salsa(which i wish there was more of). Cant remember the name of what my husband ordered. Some kind of pulled pork that ˜he enjoyed as well. Only complaint we both had about the food was the black beans(to go with the white rice) that are served with most means. I love all kinds of rice and beans including black beans but these had very little flavor or seasoning to them. The resturant itself reminded me of a vacation we took in south america last year. Very small. Nothing fancy but a good feel to it. Wish the staff was a little better. Dont expect a friendly welcome or too many smiles."
10488,43,4,0,4/6/2010,Surprisingly great. ˜Reasonably priced.
10489,43,4,0,2/4/2008,"A friend of mine was recently trying to recover from having forgotten his anniversary and was looking for a place to take his wife out that night, somewhere nice and classy -- but, of course, not too expensive. He kind of put me on the spot, since I didn't want to catch the blame if the night wasn't a success. Luckily, I'd just eaten at Soul de Cuba a few nights earlier, so I suggested he try there. Next day he came in raving about the place -- apparently his wife loved it, too. What's not to love? The food is great, the service helpful and the prices very reasonable. It's small and intimate enough to be romantic, too."
10490,43,5,0,12/9/2014,Don't usually write reviews but I had such a great experience I felt the need to share. I will keep it short since I don't always do this. Service is excellent from all staff. Always friendly and welcoming. I used to live in Miami and this the some of the best Cuban cuisine I've had since going to some of my favorite restaurants on calle ocho. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for authentic Cuban cuisine and great service.
10491,43,5,0,10/12/2014,Marvelous food produced in this tiny restaurant. Reservations strongly suggested.
10492,43,5,0,7/24/2014,"Went for a date night because we wanted to try something different and everything was great. The only thing we would change about our dining experience is getting an appetizer, not because it was bad, but because we were too full! We loved our meals (which were a recommendation of the bartender) and wanted to fully enjoy them. All drinks we had were awesome; sangria, mojitos, and an after dinner drink the bartender whipped up :) Fruit empanadas were the perfect ending to this meal. Will definitely go back again. make reservations because it is a small place :)"
10493,43,5,0,7/23/2014,I order takeout from here 1-2 times a month. The pulled pork is amazing and well worth it. Haven't eaten inside yet but I want to try the mojito they look great
10494,43,5,0,2/7/2014,Only place around here to get delicious authentic Cuban food. Must try the empanadas and ropa vieja!
10495,43,5,0,3/29/2013,Delicious and affordable
10496,43,5,0,1/22/2013,"Thank you Soul de Cuba for the wonderful and tasteful taste of an authentic Cuban cuisine!! To everyone: My brother and I sat down and ate after doing some work for the restaurant and I have to say they make the best Mojito true to Cuba's roots. The food was insatiable, every bite was flavorful, dishes were full of color and the atmosphere was relaxing with lights dimmed and the brightness of New Haven shimmering through the windows. If you have not tried Soul de Cuba or you find yourself wanting to try the taste of Cuba hands down I highly recommend them! Their staff make you feel at home, the service is top notch and very prompt. Mike, the director was a pleasure to deal with and Soul de Cuba will be our go to cuisine for Cuban delight. Thank you!"
10497,43,5,0,1/21/2013,"As a first time customer I will definately recommend Soul De Cuba (New Haven) to my family and friends. ˜I am not familiar with any of their dishes but, after having an appertizer I was tempted to order again. ˜Not only is the food delicious but also very appertizing. ˜ I took my visiting mom who came from Cape Town, South Africa and she felt at home the moment we stepped into the restaurant. ˜The staff was friendly and so helpful and made us feel at home while we were having our meal. ˜They surely deserve a FIVE STAR."
10498,43,5,0,11/26/2011,"Soul de Cuba is the perfect venue for a variety of occasions. ˜I've taken every friend or acquaintance here who's visiting from out of town, and they've always been impressed. ˜The setting is intimate and friendly; the background music is fun/zesty; the servers are extremely personable and are of various ethnicities--they've all got interesting life stories and they're the best part about the restaurant. ˜I think what's really special about this place is that you can develop a relationship over time to the restaurant. ˜I love sitting at the bar to chat--it's very cozy and protected from the street view. ˜They've had many celebrities coming through there in the recent years and are especially discrete on that regard. ˜ The food is delicious. ˜The lunch sandwiches (tilapia, cubano, steak/onions, eggplant) are amazing, appropriately priced, and in generous portions. ˜They usually have special brunches on weekends. ˜Dinners are fantastic (LOVE the oxtail, the soul de cuba, the appetizers). ˜They make a really mean mojito as well as sangria. ˜Is it authentic? ˜The recipes descend from the owner's family in cuba--they vastly improved the original recipes and are always experimenting with new dishes. ˜They make their own sauces and receive requests from CUBA for shipments. ˜ Love this place."
10499,43,5,0,11/17/2011,Awesome food and drink with friendly and competent service. My favorite is the ox tail...no joke...delicious! I particularly enjoy sitting at the cozy bar for dinner. I have been going there for a few years now and have never had any problems with greasy food as was mentioned in one of the previous reviews.
10500,43,5,0,11/12/2011,"Jesus Puerto, owner of Soul de Cuba Cafe, What an inspiring man! After a near death experience in 1993 he decided to dedicate his life to enhancing the human experience. Hello, my kind of person! When we met in 2004 and Jesus described his background to me, souldecuba.com ˜I just had to check the restaurant out. In the first few minutes i was inside, i was enjoying my first experience with Cuban food and i was hooked. The staff is friendly and down to earth and the artwork, music and general ambiance all bring a story of Jesus' West African, Cuban and South Florida roots right into the dining room. Oh, and the food is fantastic. As the name says Soul de Cuba Cafe (CUBAN SOUL FOOD) so you can expect that many of the items will be paired with rice, black beans (grandma's recipe) and plantain. The meats are traditionally marinated in mojo (traditional cuban marinade made with garlic, citrus, vinegar based) so there is a lot of flavor but the food is NOT SPICY :). After experiencing this magical place and participating in it's development every day since that day in 2004, i just had to express how special Soul de Cuba Cafe is to me."
5160,43,5,0,10/23/2011,"good rice, plantanos, and steaks"
10501,43,5,1,1/3/2015,"Wow, that was good! Officially one of my very favorite restaurants in the state of CT and I look forward to coming back :-) Between the three of us, we ordered most of the menu and it was all great. The mojitos were also very tasty!!! They are a little small and I'm guessing they probably get very busy during peak times, but it was great when we went."
10502,43,5,1,1/1/2015,"Friendly, unpretentious staff. ˜Delicious food and drinks. ˜Nothing was too spicy or bland. ˜Can't wait to go again and try different entrees."
10503,43,5,1,12/22/2014,This place is incredible. ˜You must make reservations though because there are only 8-10 tables. ˜The ceviche and the papa rellena are to die for. ˜I was making noises because the flavors were so poignant and rich. ˜The artwork in this restaurant is also pretty distinctive. ˜It may be hard to pay attention to your date. ˜The flan and shortcake desserts were also delectable.
10504,43,5,1,12/21/2014,"The best Cuban sandwich I've had! ˜Ask for the house made Mojot hot sauce to put on it, it's excellent and not too hot, it's citrusy. ˜For $10 you get a big sandwich and choice of chips, side salad or soup -- a great value. ˜The big Rum Punch I had for $9 was great, made with coconut rum -- not too too sweet as some are. ˜Service was fantastic both times I have come here, very friendly and personable, people seem to actually be having a good time working here. ˜I want to try some of the other dishes, but whenever this place pops into my head I have an instant craving for one of the excellent pressed sandwiches!"
10505,43,5,1,12/9/2014,"I adore Soul de Cuba. I am very proud to be able to say that in present tense. I have to admit that I was a little nervous seeing it again after having such fond memories of it from over six years ago. It was a little like seeing a long-lost friend: Has she aged well? Is she happy? Has she gotten fat? Yes, yes, and no. She is still absolutely fabulous, and doesn't even make you feel bad about it. A few weeks ago, I took some friends kind enough to host me in their new New Haven home, and it was so worthy of their hospitality! All three of us left happy with the experience, from service to food to drinks to flan. Get a mojito, get platanos maduros, get a flan, but most importantly, get a reservation!"
10506,43,5,1,12/2/2014,"Hello, Cuba I'm not usually this blunt, but if you don't try this place, you're ˜are an idiot. This place is fantastic hands down. I love South Beach, Miami, this is the closest I've come to Havana in CT. Food, drinks are outstanding, just ask the bar man, Donald to take car of you his the man!!!"
10507,43,5,1,11/22/2014,"I graduated from college 6 years ago and have no business being in a college town. They mostly suck, New Haven included. I was beginning to regret visiting here... until I ate at Soul de Cuba Cafe. I just ate the best Cuban food in the U.S., and this beats all such restaurants I've tried in Miami. The beef and chicken empanadas are PERFETO. Like a Ruben's empanada just authentic and more refined. Ropa vieja is flavorful but gets a bit boring at the end. Great experience overall. All other meats are amazing!"
10508,43,4,1,11/21/2014,"It's been several years since I have been here, hopefully it won't be that long again. ˜Went during restaurant week and everything was so good. It's a small space so be sure to make a reservation."
10509,43,1,1,11/11/2014,"Had a horrible dining experience on a Tuesday night. My companion ordered the chicken thighs that, when cut, were ice cold inside -obviously cooked prior and partially warmed up. ˜We flagged the wait staff and made them aware of this. ˜The chicken came back out of the kitchen within minutes --micro waved with all the sauce removed and the chicken inedible. ˜My pork was also fairly greasy and flavorless. ˜Expectations were unfortunately set with great empanadas --but quickly dashed with the main courses. When we brough this to the attention of the wait staff, they did nothing up to and including reducing the bill. ˜Just stuck it to us. ˜We felt bad not leaving a tip, but need some response. ˜Service was also quite bad --probably because the wait staff was avoiding us once that they understood what was going on. I would suggest that Yelpers eat elsewhere near Yale or in New Haven"
10510,43,4,1,11/9/2014,"Yummy motofu!! Really yummy dessert : flan de ambiente! Went there for lunch on a Sunday. Tiny place, very popular because of the good food. Be sure to reserve a table ahead of time. Only downside: high prices for all items. Will be back for more!!"
10511,43,1,1,11/6/2014,Waiter took so long that gave me time to really analyze menu and realize how pricey dishes were based on ingredients (Food Bazaar buy 6 plantains for $2) .... waited more....walked out.
10512,43,5,1,11/2/2014,"If only every town had such a rich access to cultural food heritages. ˜There would never be fast food or chicken finger mentality if people treated tradition like this place does. ˜The family recipes here have been handed down and stay a secret so if you're even tempted to try don't hesitate, it is an amazing dining experience and your senses won't fail you no matter what you order!"
10513,43,4,1,10/24/2014,"Fast and good savory food. Tell me how to make those rice and beans! If only the ""Coke"" weren't actually Pepsi :("
10514,43,4,1,10/24/2014,"Mojitos were great! ˜Guava and coconut. Recommended My wife and I ordered meals, but wanting to try their empanadas without pigging out, I asked if it was possible to buy just one. ˜Our waiter arranged this for us. Empanada (beef) - Very good, not the best I've ever had (the best were in Argentina and Chile), but highly recommended none the less. Black bean soup - Excellent! Ropa vieja - Very tasty, excellent blend of flavors and spices, shredded pork very good, quantity was quite a lot. Tostones - meh! Tres leches - Fantastico! ˜Don't fill up so you can order this for dessert. Ambience - loved the Cuban jazz, cozy, very nicely decorated. ˜Be sure to make a reservation, because it can get crowded, it's not a large place. We'll be back for sure!"
10515,43,4,1,10/15/2014,A great little hole in the wall place with super yummy and homey food. I got the black bean soup and it was super creamy and delicious. I also got the empanadas trio which I was also fond of thanks to the super crispy and flaky crust. It's a small place so if you want to eat here on the weekend I would get a reservation.
10516,43,5,1,10/12/2014,Great family restaurant authentic Cuban food A+++ The guy Mike that runs the place is very friendly along with the rest of the staff super professional very good food I highly recommend the oxtail it's amazing I couldn't ask for more
10517,43,2,1,10/9/2014,"I have to concur with my earlier review - figured I would try it again a few years later. ˜Same thoughts - food is good but not great; not particularly strong seasoning. ˜Cocktails are average but not great - a good mojito should be refreshing and delicious, not sweet. ˜The staff are the same - nice but distracted. ˜I really want to like this place, but it just doesn't hold up."
10518,43,5,1,10/7/2014,"We stopped here for dinner on the way back from a meeting in Hartford. Yelp lead me to this cute cozy corner restaurant. At first we weren't sure as the lure of the other fancy restaurants on the block was distracting, but we trusted the reviews we read... And weren't disappointed!! Empanadas were hands down the best I've ever had! Dining room is small, but staff was attentive and extremely knowledgable about the menu items and ingredients. Hector was great! Dinner was great! We asked for a piece of grilled chicken for my 2 year old as they don't have a kids menu... They were super accommodating and didn't even charge us for it cause ""it was so little"" ... Seriously nice people and great food!"
10519,43,4,1,9/12/2014,"I don't know enough about Cuban food to rate it versus other Cuban food but I will say this: I enjoyed my food, it was quick service and very good. The waiters were not very knowledgeable providing the wrong description of food on two occasions. One thing I do know, or thought I knew, was that I didn't like flan. How my views have changed. Their flan was awesomely amazing. Get the specialty one with plantains and warm butter rum and whipped cream. Delicious!!"
10520,43,5,1,8/30/2014,"What can I say? This place is great! Everything from customer service to food presentation was great! I went here with my mom and two friends. It was Monday and the place was empty. I ordered a guava mojito. It was refreshing and light. We ordered for appetizer tostones, which are smashed plantains served with a side sauce. Ask for the ajoli sauce, it's so much better than the one it first comes with. My mother and I asked for Ropa Vieja which is pulled beef with a side of rice, beans and yellow plantains. It was so delicious! It was so tender, perfect seasoning! After such a great entree we ordered deserts. I ordered the original flan, my friend order the flan with rum, her mom ordered the tres leeches and my mom ordered the Cuban coffee. We were all pleasantly surprised at how good everything was! Our waitress was so nice! She was very attentive and answered all our questions without loosing patience. :) the restaurant was clean, including the bathrooms, which is a huge plus for me. Overall, this was an excellent experience, not one bad thing found in this restaurant. Love it! :D"
10521,43,1,1,8/24/2014,"The first two words that come to mind are OVERPRICED RIPOFF! $5 per empanada? $10 for a shot glass of red wine? However, the cherry on top was $5 for the lemonades my kids drank. Yes, $5 for a small glass of ice and a couple of sips of lemon water. The prices completely overshadowed the food at this place. So, if you want to feel completely ripped off, then this is your place!"
10522,43,5,1,8/23/2014,Bravo!
10523,43,5,1,8/15/2014,"Good service, food, and drinks! We enjoyed the sangria, mojito, ropa vieja, and cafe con leche. My husband and I went to school in Miami and miss Cuban cuisine. It was flavorful but well balanced so likely a safe mix of entrees for those seeking authentic or modern dishes!"
10524,43,1,1,8/10/2014,"Had lunch there today, food was not good at all and spent $80.00 should have just thrown out car window. Calamari ˜was over cooked , ox tail was not ˜right meat tasted ˜off.. Good ˜Luck ˜but I told ˜u all"
10525,43,3,1,8/10/2014,Food was great but the server was not attentive to hos customers. Did not come back to see receive feedback on the food or to refill our drinks. He was too busy sitting at the bar on his cellphone. Three stars for the service.
10526,43,4,1,7/22/2014,omg! the drinks were amazing and the food was delioucous!!! yes i had the cuban sandwich with freid yucka yummy! the lunch menus is great. and they also make the best mojito's
10527,43,3,1,7/20/2014,"The three stars are for the service only, not the food. We had lunch here on a Sunday afternoon. Not busy at all. There were 4 of us and it took over an hr. to eat. Not one time did they come to refill our drinks. I actually had to get up w/my glass to ask for more water. I only saw two employees and the girl at the bar had their undivided attention the whole time. We all ordered different versions of the traditional Cuban sandwich. They were all very good."
5166,43,4,1,7/16/2014,"Soul de Cuba is unique among New Haven restaurants. Authentic, delicious Cuban food in a laid-back, intimate space adorned with art and family photos. It can be on the pricy side for what they serve, but each of the half-dozen or so times I've eaten here has been a great experience. It's a small space and tables are limited, so make a reservation. You typically won't need one for brunch/lunch but even then the available tables can fill up quickly. I've heard complaints from a few friends about the service being slow, but I've never had an issue. Besides, I'd much prefer a leisurely meal to having the next course thrown down before the previous one is even finished. If you're not familiar with Cuban cuisine, it leans more toward the spicy and flavorful than outright hot. Lots of tomato, citrus, garlic, olives, onion. Their empanadas and papas rellenas, both served with a mango-habanero salsa, are great ways to start the meal. The ropa vieja and fricase de pollo entrees, both staples of traditional Cuban cuisine, are among the best I've had anywhere. Nearly everything is served with their amazing platanos maduros, which balance out the spice with a subtle sweetness. I'm usually too stuffed after a meal here to even consider dessert, but if you manage to save some room, the guava empanada is wonderful. Even if you've never had Cuban food before, give Soul de Cuba a try! It's an underappreciated but consistently great part of the New Haven restaurant scene."
10528,43,5,1,7/9/2014,Soul De Cuba Cafe is a cute little restaurant in New Haven. ˜I was only able to pass by New Haven for dinner but it had made the night memorable. ˜The appetizers all look very promising but my friends and I were only hungry enough to order an entree per person. ˜I've tried everyone's food and they were all nothing short of amazing. ˜I ordered the oxtail entree. ˜The entree comes with two pieces of fried plantains. ˜The oxtail meat was tender and falls right off the bone! ˜The sauce was aromatic and I finished my entree before I can slow down. ˜Definitely a great spot for dinner!
10529,43,5,1,6/29/2014,Food was amazing. My hubby and I both got great vegetarian dishes and there were more to choose from yet. The yuca fries were also great. Can't wait to go back. Make a reservation as this place is very small. The service was okay.
10530,43,1,1,6/25/2014,Dog Food - You have come to the right place. I hear so many great reviews from people about the food here yet I can't figure it out. ˜ Was it a bad food night? ˜Was there something in the air? ˜ I have no idea but my food was awful. ˜ I was excited to try the ropa vieja and when it arrived looking and tasting like purina from a can. ˜ ˜The service was AWFUL. ˜The wait staff was MIA (and its a tiny place - where could they go) Maybe you won't have the same experience going here.
10531,43,3,1,6/24/2014,"Food: amazing. Sangria: great. Service: rarely friendlier. Atmosphere: drums, drums, and more drums. I'm not sure who thought it would be a good idea to have a three person drum performance in a restaurant that seats 15 people tops, but it meant I couldn't hear my date speak across the table even when we shouted. My eardrums were assaulted even as I enjoyed the chicken dish. Every time the drummers stopped we prayed for a respite but, alas, they continued on until absolutely everybody had left the restaurant. Nobody clapped because nobody wanted them there in the first place. Please, for the love of god, do not eat at soul de cubs if there's another drum performance unless you don't like being able to hear yourself think, let alone speak to anyone. Otherwise, great!"
10532,43,4,1,6/21/2014,Nice local place for great authentic Cuban food. ˜Empanadas were the best! ˜Not a big place so call ahead. ˜Both our entrees were very flavorful and came with a good portion such that we couldn't eat it all after having appetizers. ˜Would recommend and return if in the area.
10533,43,4,1,6/21/2014,Loved it. Yuka frites were a great twist on French fries. Atmosphere is small and cozy and friendly. Great selection of drinks and some really nice authentic Cuban dishes. We will be back!
10534,43,4,1,6/21/2014,Food and drinks are both excellent but a tad overpriced. Ambience is good and no wait for dinner during week nights.
10535,43,5,1,6/12/2014,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in New Haven. I love the cozy, dim-it atmosphere of this place. They have the best rope vieja I have ever tried. It has a very authentic flavor and you can tell its made with love. The staff is very welcoming and friendly."
10536,43,5,1,6/4/2014,"I love this place for their Cuban sandwiches! Priced around $10 a sandwich, they are perfect for a weekend lunch or lazy brunch (sandwiches only available for lunch). The portions are generous and I usually order them with the side salad - nothing like fresh greens and tomato accompanying a hefty Cubano (ham, swiss, mustard - neatly pressed into crispy, warm Cuban sandwich perfection). I've been here several times and have seen most of the sandwiches on their menu - none have been a disappointment (if it's your first time here I recommend starting with the Cubano - there are so many things right with this sandwich)"
10537,43,5,1,6/2/2014,I am not very familiar with Cuban food but I was very impressed. I got the salmon and my boyfriend ordered the Cuban sandwich. We were both very happy and the salmon was a large portion! The place is small and cozy and there is a parking garage right across the street as well as street parking Definitely looking forward to another trip back
10538,43,2,1,5/18/2014,"I have been dying to try this place for years. We had an early reservation and pretty much had the whole place to ourselves. Our server was friendly, drinks were great. Then the food came. Our calamari was overlooked, rubbery , and probably frozen, not fresh. My husband's dinner was brought out with the wrong sides. My meal was ok, but somewhat bland. The chicken seemed like it was precooked. The waitress comped us a drink when she realized the mistake with my husbands meal. ( we didn't complain, she realized when she saw my husband didn't eat a lot if his meal). Overall, it's was an average meal for a lot of money. I've had better Cuban food, even in the northeast. We won't go back."
10539,43,4,1,4/25/2014,"Nice, small place. ˜Very friendly staff and food was excellent. ˜Would definitely return."
10540,43,5,1,4/22/2014,"fell in love with the place, its nice and cozy, the food is out standing and I'm latin so I would know about latin food. Went their for brunch also very very good. my favorite place."
10541,43,2,1,3/23/2014,This place was recommended to me by a friend and a major disappointment. I went for lunch which may have been my first mistake. It's extremely over priced for the quality and amount of food and it was possibly the worse service I've ever had. This is a small place and can only fit a few tables. There was one other group there and they were wrapping up so I would have thought we would have had superior service but it was the opposite. This is not a place I would return for food maybe drinks is different.
10542,43,3,1,3/20/2014,"We ate lunch at Soul de Cuba New Haven 03182014. ˜I've eaten Cuban food all of my life and my wife (from Puerto Rico) and I have eaten at countless numbers of Cuban restaurants, mostly in south Florida. ˜Near home there are no Cuban restaurants so to treat ourselves to a Cuban meal, which we hadn't had in a good while, we did a little trip down to Soul de Cuba, our first meal there. ˜It's a small place and we paid to park on the street nearly in front of the restaurant - very low fee. ˜The menu is very complete - we selected two of our favorites - the Picadillo and Palomilla steak, two of the most traditional Cuban selections. ˜Each plate came with black beans and rice and sweet fried plantains - in our book all a must for a real Cuban meal. Overall, we'd have to rate the food as ok in comparison to the other Cuban restaurants where we've eaten and to our own preparation of Cuban food. ˜That doesn't mean that it wasn't a good meal - we devoured everything, and it was a tasty meal. ˜But we felt it was a notch below what we usually have in FL. ˜The Picadillo I like and prepare has some tomato sauce - this appeared to have none. ˜And it did have capers, which I would rather not have. ˜Otherwise it was pretty well seasoned and it was tasty. ˜The black beans were ok. ˜Rice properly cooked. ˜The Palomilla steak was a notch below average - it could have had more seasoning, and most places in FL will serve it with some chopped onion and parsley for a little extra kick (which also works well for the black beans). ˜None came on our plate. ˜The sweet fried plantains were top notch. One thing missing was any Cuban bread. ˜That is a shame but as far as I know real Cuban bread doesn't exist outside of south FL - apparently a well kept secret recipe. ˜The pricing at Soul de Cuba was somewhat high - for our two plates about $10 more than what we are used to in FL. ˜We probably will not return, but we had a pretty good meal."
10543,43,5,1,3/11/2014,"Over the 7 years I have lived in this town I have been to this place maybe 50 times. What can I say, I love their afro-cuban food. I had fallen in love with the paladares in Cuba and Soul de Cuba makes up for the missing havana clubs with its atmosphere. This place serves all the favorite Cuban dishes (like ropa vieja and oxtail) and makes everything amazing by mixing up the best mojitos outside of Bodeguita del Medio in Havana (although very expensive for NH standards). Friendliest waiter(resse)s in town. Appetizer sampler is a whole meal."
10544,43,3,1,3/11/2014,"I was really looking forward to trying this hole-in-the-wall, especially after hearing and reading so many good things about it. And oh man do I love Cuban food! Unfortunately, despite the cute, intimate vibe and the sweet waitress, I was very underwhelmed by my experience. The place is small, so it was packed. We luckily had a reservation (recommended!) so we didn't have to wait to be seated. That was the only thing we didn't have to wait for... I ordered a mojito and my friends and I shared some appetizers: the empanadas and the tostones. The mojito was quite good, not too sweet, but any more than one and the sugar would have given me a headache. The empanadas were tasty - I tried the veggie - nice and crisp, golden brown, flavorful. The tostones tasted like nothing, were well under-seasoned - which actually is a theme I noticed here - but had a tasty, creamy dipping sauce accompaniment. For my entree, I had the ropa vieja, a traditional and standard Cuban dish. The shredded beef was juicy and fine, but overall the entire dish just lacked seasoning. I had to add salt to really detect much flavor. A few friends ordered a wonderful chicken dish - pollo de ajo y naranja - which I'd order again if I returned. A tofu dish was described as nothing special. That said, the ceviche and drinks were tasty. A final note: service was absurdly slow. I know it's small, and it's a laid back Cuban vibe, but if you are looking to eat in less than 2 hours, maybe go somewhere else. Overall, it was fine, but I won't be rushing back any time soon."
10545,43,3,1,2/16/2014,"My friends and I went to Soul de Cuba for lunch. We got the croquetas de jaiba, empanadas, papa rellena, chicken fricase, and two desserts. The croquetas were great, crispy and airy, and tasted like crab. The filling of the empanadas was unfortunately dry and bland, though the pastry itself was well fried. The papa rellena had a nice crust to the outside, but the filling - probably the same filling as the beef empanada - and the mashed potatoes tasted pretty bland. The chicken fricase was well cooked but again, extremely bland. Soul de Cuba isn't authentic nor particularly flavorful or spicy. The flan and tres leches cake were excellent though. I'd go back for coffee and dessert."
5227,43,3,1,12/19/2013,"Cute place, a great glass of wine- accept it came in a tall glass.... Food was good but nothing spectacular. I'd probably head back here sometime. Not bad."
10546,43,4,1,12/10/2013,"First, this place always seems packed and whenever I'm in the area I usually go to Geronimo, which is about 50 feet away. But Gitmo was closed for a holiday function and my crew was ornery and hungry and not in the mood for excuses, so we gave it a try. We tried some appetizer plates, which were pretty darn good. The real standout was the black bean chili, it was excellent. Also shared the slow cooked pork after sticking my head into the rather small kitchen and inquiring of the chef what was it that he was cooking. Turns out that he was cooking said pork, which was good and not greasy. Then the place filled up to capacity and we were on our way.......... We also decided that a trip to Florida would be a good."
10547,43,3,1,10/27/2013,"This restaurant was cute inside but VERY small. ˜Not such a big deal, except that they told us when we were seated that we would have to leave about an hour later because there was a reservation after us. ˜That would be OK except for the fact that I had called a week in advance to make a reservation of my own. ˜ They then asked a person in my party to move their seat so that they could seat someone at the table behind us, where there was also not enough room. ˜I get that it is a small place, but I did not enjoy being told what to do and when to leave from when I walked in the door. ˜ The food was good, not great. ˜One person in our party got the platano relleno which was wonderful. ˜The combination of flavors was interesting but great. ˜Myself and the other party got chicken dishes, which were just okay. ˜The staff was friendly. ˜They also had a credit card machine which was not working, and they didn't tell anyone until the end of the meal, so if you didn't have cash you were out of luck or they had to write all your credit card information down (I really didn't like that idea). Good thing we had cash. ˜ All and all this was a decent restaurant, but not amazing, which is why I gave it a 3."
10548,43,4,1,10/17/2013,"Allow me to preface: ˜I'm Floridian at heart, so I know me some good ol' authentic Cuban food. ˜Soul de Cuba is pretty damned amazing. ˜A small place, the interior reminds me of Miami - terracotta colored tile, palms, small wooden tables, ceiling fan, cream colored walls decorated with photographs and cigar logos - conjures up images of warm weather and Florida (or Cuban) sunshine. There was only one girl working as hostess, server, bartender and busser, and while the place only had about 4 tables occupied at a time, Yessenia did a great job flying solo. ˜ Drinks were well made and portioned in standard water/soda glasses, but nothing special. ˜Tasty, but for $9 I can pour a shot of rum over ice and crack open a can of pineapple juice on top. ˜ I was SO excited at the prospect of having a proper Cuban sandwich - outside of Florida they're rare and usually have some modification that makes them terrible (turkey? ˜Really?)... I was very saddened to find out that sandwiches were not served after 5PM. ˜On a semi-side note, I always find it unbelievable that establishments still abide by this with certain fare. ˜I understand if it's dinner and someone wants eggs benedict, but if you've got the pork for other entrees, a bottle of yellow mustard and some Cuban bread still hanging around... why can't you make a sandwich?? ˜Does someone take the sandwich press home at 4:59, therefore no sandwiches? ˜Such a silly rule. ˜But I digress... I ordered the lechon asada - pulled mojo-marinated pork served with saut?ed onions over black rice with fried plantains. ˜Yessenia told me that my order was filled with the best part of the Cuban sandwich - the pork. ˜Well have mercy - if that pork goes on their Cuban, I'll be back before 5pm once a week! ˜Their pork is seriously the BEST pulled pork I've ever eaten - between Latin cuisine and BBQ, this tops it all. ˜It was so moist and tender with such good flavor, I totally forgot about my sandwich loss. ˜The rice was just rice, but the plantains were great. They also have their own hot sauce which is super citrusy and is a nice alternative to most other sauces. ˜The pargo a la cubana (snapper saut?ed with tomato, onion and garlic over rice with black beans) was superb, too - the black beans were awesome and definitely seemed homemade. The food is not cheap by any means ($74 for two drinks and entrees), which would also be nice to have sandwiches as dinner options considering New Haven is a [verrrry expensive] college town... but all in all, I was deliriously happy with the food."
10549,43,4,1,10/6/2013,"Tiny restaurant, make sure to make a reservation for dinner. They have delicious cocktails and world-class ropa vieja. The interior and decorations are unique and tell the story of the owner and his family. There is also a Soul de Cuba in Hawaii!"
10550,43,4,1,10/1/2013,"I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone! I have eaten here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. I personally love the salmon entree, but my friends and family are big fans on just about anything on the menu. The food has great taste and I have heard very good comments about their alcohol drinks as well. SDC also gives you a very homey feeling, which I love to feel when I'm eating lunch or dinner. Even though it is a small establishment I have never felt like the people next to me were too close, I actually feel it to be a very intimate space. The only reason I am giving it a 4 rather than a 5 is because I was very disappointed by the service a couple of times, but in one of the last times that I went two servers, Julian and Michelle really made my friend and I feel very well taken care of. I cannot wait to go back and enjoy their great food and service!"
10551,43,5,1,9/27/2013,"- This is the first and only Cuban restaurant I've been to but the food is amazing! - The ropa vieja is one of the most delicious dishes I've had anywhere! - The plantain that comes with the meals is a must-have subtly sweet compliment to a savory meal! - Price: somewhat high for someone on a budge but a good deal given the large plate portion sizes and quality. - Atmosphere: quaint, small, cozy, well decorated, colorful, and good music. - Service: rather long wait time for meals so ordering drinks is a good buffer."
10552,43,2,1,9/8/2013,Food is okay but very pricy for the quality. Appetizer for 15 bucks and entree for 18 at minimum.
10553,43,4,1,8/28/2013,BOMB cuban food. I had an appointment nearby and stopped for lunch based on the high yelp reviews. I wasn't disappointed. I tried their cuban soul sandwich and it was awesome. Looking forward to going back. My only complaint is prices are a bit on the high side.
10554,43,3,1,8/17/2013,"While walking around downtown on a weeknight, we decided on an early dinner. We Yelped Soul de Cuba and decided to head over there. There was one couple dining when we arrived, but they left shortly after we sat down, so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Our server was fantastic - he was willing to accommodate my requests for more cilantro, bread, and hot sauce for my black bean soup. The husband and I really appreciated his great service. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that the food quite held up to other Cuban food I have had before - I agree with some other reviewers that there was a lack of spice. We started with the papa rellena - it came out quickly and was a very tasty croquette. Then, dinner came - my black bean soup (giant bowl) and the ropa viaja entree, unfortunately not super flavorful. Husband had to add some of my cilantro from the soup to give it a bit more zing. Overall, the waiter pulled this up from a two star review. In order to come back, I'd want better pricing for what we received and some more spice to each of the dishes."
10555,43,3,1,8/17/2013,"I enjoyed this restaurant quite a bit. The staff was very friendly and attentive and I love how small the dining area is. You can actually have a conversation with your ˜dinner guests without having to yell over noise from hundreds of other patrons. I don't think it would be fair to comment on the food as a whole since I've only been there once, but the meals my wife and I had were both very good. I gave it 3-stars because of the price. I don't mind paying $24 for a chicken dish if I can bring home some leftovers, but my dinner was served on what would be considered a side plate at most other restaurants. Dinner for my wife and I was just under $50 (before tip) and we each had 1 soda (no drinks, apps or desserts). I enjoyed my experience and food at this restaurant. I think it's unlikely that we would return simply based on price."
10556,43,4,1,8/13/2013,I have been here a few times and always been pretty happy with my experience. The pollo moderno and the ropa vieja are both great dishes that come in large enough portions that you will have leftovers to bring home. ˜The plantains that come with them are consistently fantastic. ˜The cocktails are pretty good. ˜I haven't had one that was good enough I had to order another but they are all respectable. What keeps me from giving the place a higher rating is first the price of the meals. ˜I would say the entrees are somewhere between five and seven dollars higher than they should be on flavor alone. ˜Since the place is small and can't do much for volume in business I could see the prices being a bit higher but then my expectations for the food and drinks are much higher. ˜Also there are maybe two or three tables I would want to sit at--I'm not a fan of high tops. All around it is a pretty good place and does Cuban food much better than Zafra's (strongly recommend not going there).
10557,43,2,1,8/11/2013,"Where do you begin when you have a dinner experience that is less than you expected. ˜First they seated us directly in the path of the air conditioner so that cold air was blowing on me the entire evening and the noise from the air conditioner meant I had trouble hearing what my friends were saying to me. ˜But that was only a part what was disappointing. ˜The food and the service have gone downhill fast at this restaurant. The server completely got my dinner order wrong and I just sat there while my friends ate their entrees. ˜No one offered me an apology. ˜The least they could have done was to offer me a free drink. It was badly handled. ˜Then when my dish finally arrived it was disappointing The meat tasted like it had been heated in a microwave oven and was way too salty. ˜One other thing that is a sign of bad management and a restaurant in trouble--the entrees that did arrive arrived before we had finished the appetizers. Why rush the dining experience? ˜I noticed that other diners were also getting their entrees before they had finished their appetizers. ˜I hope that the owners can turn this place around. ˜I've liked Soul de Cuba in the past but this was not their night. Not going back unless they begin to step up their game. There are far too many good restaurants in New Haven to go to one with high prices, bad service, and mediocre food."
10558,43,4,1,7/31/2013,One of the best places for Cuban Sandwiches.
10559,43,4,1,7/22/2013,"Really nice staff. They close at 10pm but were cool with my friend and I walking in around 9:55pm and still ordering an entree. The food was really good, but pricey! I made the mistake of not looking carefully at the cost and didn't realize the one entree I was ordering was $25. It was very filling (couldn't finish it) and tasty, and worth going to once, but I'm not sure I'd be a regular customer considering the price. * Pollo Moderno - 4 stars pic: yelp.com/biz_photos/soul? (Marinated chicken breast breaded and lightly fried served under our mango, guava, pineapple and black bean salsa served with arroz blanco, frijoles negros and platanos maduros. $24.95) Very sweet chicken, with a really nice even breading. This was full of sweet flavors, with some thick juicy slices of plantains. The meat in the chicken was ever so slightly dry, but I liked that it had an almost shredded texture. The dryness was actually fine because there were so many sauces/salsas in this dish. The black beans were really tasty - a little watery, but still really great."
10560,43,4,1,7/7/2013,"I passed by this restaurant once before. ˜I entered the door and the delectable aromas drew me in. ˜However, it was so crowded that I couldn't stay. ˜I came back another night with some of friends. ˜Food was great and their mojito was one of the best that I've had. ˜Great ambiance and good service!"
10561,43,2,1,6/27/2013,Mediocre food
10562,43,3,1,6/16/2013,"Pleasant staff, great music, and generally original place. ˜Cozy or small depending on how you see it. ˜Service was pretty good. My only real critique is that the food is a bit bland and being there on 3 separate occasions it all tastes a bit the same. I haven't yet had the ""amazing"" food that others are quoting. I'm a bit torn like Steph. C... I'd like to like it more, but for high prices for food that isn't so remarkable."
10563,43,5,1,6/4/2013,"Awesome. ˜If I could move in to Soul de Cuba and have them make all my meals, I would. ˜Service: ˜Awesome. ˜Food: ˜Awesome. ˜Mojito: ˜Awesome. ˜Cafe con leche: ˜Awesome. ˜Cute little Cuba-y themed restaurant: ˜Awesome. Get the Yuca Frita appetizer. ˜So yummy. The ropa vieja and the pargo a la cubana are my two favourite mains. ˜All of the sandwiches are also fantastic, but my favourite is the media niche. ˜If you aren't sure what to order, stick to the items with an asterisk, which indicates traditional cuban fare. ˜So far everything I have tried with an asterisk has been excellent, while some of the last traditional dishes have not been as consistently good. My family and I consider the portions to be fairly large, so we usually order one appetizer and one main for every 2 adults. The only con in my list is that, because its tiny, ˜you pretty much always need ˜a reservation if you are gong at a peak meal time. ˜But, they a very organized about their reservations, so if you have one you will be able to walk right in."
10564,43,5,1,5/21/2013,"Thank you to everyone at Soul de Cuba. I had a wonderful birthday meal as did everyone in our party. We truly appreciated the staff accommodating on a busy night, as we were a very large party in a very cozy place. The food and drinks were superb, so much so that someone actually made a toast to it. I personally loved my mojito, tapa platter and bistec palomilla."
10565,43,5,1,5/4/2013,Soul de Cuba has been one of my favorites for years now! I highly reccommend everything as I have probably tried it all. Do not leave without having a sangria or mojito...Period!
10566,43,5,1,4/17/2013,"My favorite spot in New Haven. Try the pan con pescado (daily before 5pm) and the sangria IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST IN THE CITY. It's the founder's grandfather's recipe and it is perfection. Great energy in this place, too."
10567,43,4,1,4/16/2013,Great mojitos and yuca fries. The place is small so you should definitely call ahead. The kitchen is also tiny so it takes a while for the food but it's well worth the wait!
10568,43,2,1,3/26/2013,"So, the first time I visited this restaurant I thought it was phenomenal! It was small but cute and the food was delicious! The price wasn't bad either for what you were getting as the portions were a nice size. I remember having the oxtails and I my partner had the pan con pescado. We ordered wine and the yucca frita for an appetizer. The bill was well under $100 with tip. This was about a year ago. Since then I've ordered take out twice as I have a 2 year old who doesn't do well in restaurants. Anywho, the first take out order was a little disappointing as the portion size I remembered from dining in seemed to decrease. No harm no foul the food was still delicious and still I had plenty left over before so it was not a big deal. Yesterday I found myself craving oxtail! I called and ordered that as well as the yucca frita and empanadas. My bill was $50. Again, inflation so no worries. When I got home however I was shocked that once again the portions sizes had gone down. There were 2 oxtails in my order which cost $23. The empanadas were the flattest I had ever seen mostly crust and no filling at all. I also did not like the change to the square cardboard take out boxes which reminded me of the ones you get when you go to get a salad at whole foods. The oxtails were not as tender and really salty. I boasted about this place not too long ago, but I actually don't think I care to return. Whether eating in ordering out. Good luck!"
10569,43,5,1,2/16/2013,"i got three words for you holmes home made hot sause hahahahah ITS FOR REAL when i came in here i was feeling real raw because i was hungover again on a very inappropriate day like a wednesday or something so i call up my crew and im like ""lets do this"" we roll up to soul de cube and lo and behold they have delicious treats for everyone i guess you should get the sandwiches which are available until like 5pm (1700 for our friends in the military) like the ""cubano"" which is spanish for ""cuban"" (ahaha but i guess u knew that) or the one that I like to call the ""moonlight doggie"" which is listed under the pseudonym "" media noche"" on the menu OK that's it for today yelp, catch me on my stoop smoking rocks ahahah jk thats not my jam"
10570,43,2,1,2/14/2013,"I've come to Soul de Cuba twice. Both times we were able to get sitted without a reservation, which was a plus. First time I wasn't impressed but thought it deserved another try. Second time didn't go much better. This time the food was better. My favorite was the tapas sampler. But service was so terrible it ruined everything. I noticed other reviewers had a similar experience. The waitress was in a terrible rush to get us out of there. While we were still enjoying our appetizer we were very directy asked to eat it or wrap it because the entrees were ready. This was followed by a container handed over to me to do the wrapping. After we finished eating and were still deep in conversation and finishing our glass of wine we were asked to wrap up so they could sit others. Problem was half the restaurant was empty! Why give such an unpleasant experience to your customers when there aren't others waiting? Just bizarre."
10571,43,4,1,2/7/2013,"This restaurant is adorable, and if you make a reservation you will absolutely never have to worry about getting a seat; they're so good with their reservations. I've been a few times. ˜Their chicken and rice is amazing, their plantains (tostones) are oh-so-delish. ˜Everything has always tasted fresh, the waitstaff are super knowledgeable and really friendly, and the drinks are delicious. ˜They play relaxing music at just the right volume, and it's always cozy inside, no matter the time of year. Definitely give it a try when you're in the area!"
10572,43,4,1,1/23/2013,"I stopped in here for a drink before a concert. Um, jackpot. Had one of the most delicious Dark-and-Stormy's of my life, people. They know what they are doing here. (Sidenote: The bar is made of a layer of laquered cigar boxes. So badass.) From the looks of the food and the happy, smiling faces chowing down, I will most certainly need to head back."
10380,43,4,1,1/8/2013,This place is cute! I went here long time ago... like 6 years ago. I had chicken with rice and it was actually very good. Their drinks were nice. I liked the atmosphere the most.
10573,43,4,1,1/7/2013,Small restaurant but excellent food and good prices
10333,43,4,1,1/3/2013,"No beers on tap, which sucks, because I am not a cocktails girl, but I'll settle for some Pacifico or Red Stripe. ˜The chicken and pulled pork dishes are absolutely ridiculously delicious. ˜Pass on the pulled beef--I found it way too stringy and salty. ˜Also, you have to be willing to pay up because this is the most expensive Cuban place I've ever eaten at. The rice and beans are always great and the staff is always very attentive and friendly. ˜I've never sat at the bar in the back and it's not the most coziest or nicest of places, but the food is def worth it."
9102,43,4,1,12/6/2012,"Went for a work lunch. ˜Boss paid, and I got the special of the day which didn't have a price on the menu, so I can't comment on prices. ˜ Go the ""fufu"" which is a derivative of mofongo. ˜It was delicious, i would order it again. I was also able to sample some other things from my co-workers. The tostones were perfect and crispy. ˜The ceviche was phenomenal, some of the best i've had in CT. ˜Stay away from the calamari, tough as rubber and overcooked. ˜The empanadas were meh, nothing to rave about. ˜ Worth another shot, but nothing i'll crave."
10574,43,5,1,11/28/2012,First time here and I have to say the food was delicious. Had bistec and it was cooked and seasoned just right. Made me go back in time to my moms cooking. ˜We will be a back for sure!!!!
10575,43,5,1,11/12/2012,"I rarely have Cuban food, but I like the food here. A little pricey for two people. We had one appetizer and two main dishes that cost $62 something. But, the service is good. Their coffee is good, too."
10576,43,3,1,10/15/2012,"Soul de Cuba has all of the ingredients for an excellent dining experience. ˜Small, intimate environment without too many distracting noises caused by larger venues. Mouthwatering, savory Cuban dishes which come out pretty quickly after ordering. Some fairly delicious Sangria. But two main factors keep me from giving Soul de Cuba a higher review: mediocre service and unreasonable price points. I came here for dinner the other evening and we ordered some beers and food. ˜I had the pollo de naranja and my date had the ropa vieja. ˜Both were absolutely delicious and hit the spot. ˜Yet both were priced at about $20.00, and I wouldn't say the portions are particularly big. ˜At these prices, you'd expect to get more than a meal out of it. Meanwhile, my waiter seemed more concerned with smoking cigarettes than getting me a second beer long after I'd already finished the first. ˜And apparently hanging out by the bar. ˜I don't get it. ˜The place is tiny. ˜It was hardly swamped. ˜What's the situation here? I walked by to go to the bathroom and asked if he could grab us another round and he looked like I'd just made an off-color remark about his mother. ˜Dude, I'm so sorry I asked. ˜I didn't meant to, you know... order stuff. ˜At a restaurant. If the prices were a little better (or the portions more generous) or the service was, oh, I don't know, even decent, I could probably justify a 4-star review. ˜But tasty authentic Cuban food can only get you so far."
10577,43,2,1,10/14/2012,Bottom line. Not worth the price! Civeche starter was $15 for a Teny Tiny cup! ˜There was as much onion as shrimp. ˜Disappointing Wanted to order the sirloin steak - but they only serve it Well Done. Seriously?!?! ˜ Went with the traditional pulled pork. It was tasty and a generous portion. But still not worth the $19 for a plate of mostly rice and beans. Drinks mediocre Won't return
10578,43,5,1,10/12/2012,A really great venue wtih superb food. It really feels like Havana long ago before Castro took over. The staff is very friendly and give a 100% effort.
10579,43,4,1,10/4/2012,"My first experience of Cuban food. It's a pleasant place and the server was attentive and eager to please. The food was delicious, though I cannot speak to it's authenticity, being a newbie to Cuban food and I will definitely return. I had the papa rellena (light and fluffy mashed potato croquette stuffed with seasoned ground beef breaded and lightly fried and served with homemade mango and habanero salsa) which was light and tasty. The salsa was fruity and mild. For an entree I had soul cubano (serrano ham, manchego cheese, tender roast pork and salami dressed in cilantro and roasted garlic aioli on pressed cuban bread served with mixed greens). The sandwich was delicious, a wonderful combination of flavors and textures. The cilantro and aioli took the sandwich to a whole new level! The salad was dressed with a sweet balsamic - honey accents - which was a lovely contrast to the (slightly too) salty sandwich. I plan to return and sample other items from their menu."
10580,43,4,1,9/24/2012,"quaint place. good service. extremely authentic. went for lunch and tried the sandwiches, chicken was awesome and perfectly breaded. salad dressing a little sweet. prices are otherwise a bit pricey. i will be back for dinner though. really wanna try some of their dinner entrees."
10581,43,4,1,9/19/2012,Great little place. Good atmosphere but it is definitely a tight fit on a weekend night so reservations are best. Good authentic dishes with a mix of their own stuff. Great mojitos and margarhitas too.
10582,43,5,1,9/15/2012,Everything here is great! Awesome environment and very attentive staff! ˜Reservations suggested for groups and/or weekend evenings.
10583,43,4,1,9/5/2012,Good bar. Better than average food
10584,43,4,1,8/5/2012,"I really enjoyed my first experience in an authentic Cuban restaurant. Soul De Cuba Cafe in New Haven CT. was quaint with a Habana atmosphere, had attentive but not intrusive service, an most importantly the food was delicious! The empanadas (beef, chicken and vegetables) were far and away the best I've had, served with a spicy but not overwhelming mango salsa. The ropa vieja (pulled beef rice blackbeans and fried plantains) was a well balanced dish, though just a tinge salty. The Pollo moderno (fried flattened chicken breast) was slightly better than the fricase de pollo (grilled chicken) but both, served with the same sides as the beef dish, were an A- grade on the Yale scale. Make absolutely certain you order the Sangria--made to order--and save room for dessert. I highly recommend the Tres Leches. A moist white cake served dipped in a cream sauce with freshly made whipped cream and strawberries."
10585,43,3,1,7/29/2012,"All in all a pleasant visit. ˜I like the place but my meal was just good, not fantastic. ˜However, the Soul Margarita made up for it.... It was very good. ˜We also had the tapas sampler which came with several different things to try. ˜It had some spicy fried chickpeas that were to die for. ˜The restaurant is small and it was very hot even with the AC on. ˜Service was friendly and prompt. ˜ Others with me enjoyed their dinners saying they were good but they weren't wow'd either. ˜I'd still give this place another shot if for nothing else, the apps and cocktails."
10586,43,4,1,7/24/2012,Yummy!
10587,43,4,1,7/11/2012,"Amazing food, The wait staff is always friendly and there when you need them. Kind of small though, felt like i was on a double date with the table next to me."
10588,43,3,1,5/30/2012,"The cocktails were tasty, the fried calamari actually had a more appealing look than that which you'd get at any other restaurant and came with two delicious dipping sauces, and the pulled pork dish was well-spiced and very satisfying. ˜The only negative - the place was by no means busy, but we ended up waiting a bit before being greeted, which was kind of awkward."
10589,43,1,1,5/29/2012,"Food: I enjoyed the food here. Ropa Vieja had very tasty beef, delicious plantains, and average rice and black beans. The fish looked delicious. At $17 for beef and $22 for fish, this place was a bit pricier than it deserves to be. Service: TERRIBLE. We didn't receive a water refill the entire meal. The check was delivered before we had finished our plates (!) and there was no offer of dessert or drinks. And then, despite a less-than-full restaurant, the waiter told us he ""needed the table"" and kicked us out. Are you kidding me? This is completely unacceptable. I have never had service this bad anywhere in New Haven, except for Sally's Pizza. I will never return to this restaurant and I will definitely tell others about this bad experience. Definitely go to Zafra over Soul any day of the week. The food is way better, they have delicious cocktails, and the service is to a typical American standard."
7074,43,4,1,5/29/2012,"Went for brunch and loved it. A little pricy, maybe, but overall worth it. Drinks were good and lots of veggie potions."
10590,43,4,1,5/18/2012,Pretty good. A little expensive for what it is but huge portions and delicious food.
10591,43,4,1,5/8/2012,"Large portions, friendly service, pleasant ambience. The tapas sampler is full of cold meats, though."
10592,43,5,1,4/26/2012,"Oh man, love this restaurant. They have amazing flan, amazing bread pudding, amazing dishes. Their alcoholic beverages are also fairly nice.-- I might have gotten a rum punch or sangria. Sometimes, i just come for a slice of their exquisite flan."
5244,43,4,1,4/24/2012,"I think Tom and I debated on where to have lunch today for two hours, but after much debate we made an excellent choice! We're trying to experience more of what New Haven has to offer and sometimes that can be difficult pricewise, so lunch is usually a better option for us. Many places that we came up with and wanted to try were closed on Sundays for lunch but thankfully this was not. I've experimented with a Cubano burger from a Bobby Flay cookbook, but sadly I've never had the real deal--that was all about to change today. This is probably one of the tiniest restaurants we've ever been to, with just a handful of tables in a brightly decorated dining room, adorned with family photos, artwork, even framed cigar labels (because, let's be honest, when you think of Cuba you think of cigars!). Our waiter was on the quiet side, but very efficient. Water glasses were brought right over and Tom also ordered a beer (Cristal, from Peru). We decided on the chicken empanadas to start--hot, flaky dough with chopped chicken, peppers served with a side of mango salsa--these were so good, perfectly cooked and the salsa was a nice accompaniment. Onto our bocadillos! Tom had the Soul Cubano--serrano ham, manchego cheese (fresh cut--bit of rind on the edges!), salami, roast pork with a cilantro and roasted garlic aioli on the pressed bread--I was told I was only getting one bite of his sandwich, that's how much he enjoyed it! I went the traditional route and had the Cubano--ham, roast pork, swiss cheese, salami, pickles, mayo and mustard on the pressed bread--the amazing flavor of the pork took this sandwich by storm, along with the mustard and the nice crunch of the pickle. Both of our sandwiches were seriously amazing and we left completely satisfied, two new fans of Cuban food! Tom definitely wants to come back and try their dinners and you would definitely want to make reservations if you are looking to try this place!"
10593,43,4,1,4/20/2012,"I went to Soul de Cuba Cafe yesterday for a couple of appetizers. It was busy so we sat at the bar. The bartender who I think was the owner was so incredibly nice and friendly. The two appetizers we had were amazing! I cannot wait to go back and get a meal. Small but cute inside. Also, great authentic Cuban music."
10594,43,1,1,4/20/2012,"Have never felt compelled to write a scathing review before, ˜but my experience last night at Soul de Cuba was remarkably unimpressive to say the least. Made a reservation at 8pm, came in and the waiter seemed confused about us even having made a reservation for 2 and sat us. We received our waters after about 10 minutes and ordered our food from the restaurant week menu..then we sat there until 8:50pm wondering if we'd even get our appetizers sometime soon... At this time the waiter came over and asked us to reorder our food since they didn't get our order through for some reason! That's right, after sitting for nearly an hour they asked us to reorder our food! Basically start the process of waiting all over again! It was just ridiculous! We were the only people with not a thing on the table in the whole place. We asked to speak to the manager..which I hated to have to do, But the entire situation was absurd. Then we waited for the manager for about 10 minutes and the manager never even showed up at our table. We ended up just grabbing our coats and leaving, after sitting there for our reservation for an hour and receiving nothing but water. I can't even the critique the food, which sounded delicious, because we never even received it. Will always remember this very poor experience at Soul de Cuba! I'm sure the food is as great as it sounds, but WOW what horrible service."
10595,43,4,1,3/29/2012,"The good: Savory dishes, fun drinks The mediocre: Feels a bit crammed I was feeling adventurous so I decided to give it a shot. My friend eschews alcohol, but SdCC had a tropical drink that was so good and pineappley that she couldn't resist drinking half of mine! Job well done. The atmosphere -- I don't love it, but I did really enjoy the music. It's just a bit crammed To be fair, if I were to imagine a Cuban cafe, SdCC isn't far off the mark. So if that's what you're in the mood for though, go for it. (Every time I write these I feel like 10 minutes goes down the drain, so I'll stop here.) Definitely try SdCC if you're feeling a bit of carbs and protein, and some savory plantains."
10596,43,3,1,3/5/2012,"One of my Cuban friends loves this place so I figured I would give it a try. I love Spanish and Mexican food, but this was my first time trying Cuban food. I had the Ropa Vieja, which is one of the restaurant's most popular dishes. It tasted a bit bland to me and I can't say I was at all impressed, but there was definitely a lot of food and it was super filling. I liked the ambiance, it's really cute and a great place for private conversation. The staff was nice. I've been told that I need to try the sandwiches so it looks like I'll have to make another trip and see if I change my mind."
10597,43,4,1,3/3/2012,-sangria is fruity and just right! ˜:) -calamari is soft and crispy~~~ -try the sampler~~ ˜(maybe good for 3-4 people) -HUGE portions.... -lunch sandwiches are tasty! ***make sure to call ahead for reservations because small space and gets crowded
10598,43,4,1,2/29/2012,Great food at a decent price. They put their own spin on a variety of classic Cuban dishes.
10599,43,5,1,2/21/2012,"This is one of New Haven's treasures. Small, yet cozy. Food is great, prices are good, and you never leave hungry. Their shredded pork is my favorite (not a big fan of ropa vieja)."
10600,43,4,1,2/21/2012,"I've been there several times and it's become my go-to place for Caipirinhas (sp?) - sure, anyone can make them, but S.D.C. uses a particular cachasa (sp?) rum that's better than whatever everyone else is using. The bartenders have often been really great too - fun, sociable, friendly, and clearly knowledgeable. I haven't had the entrees but I did feel that the fried apps seemed over-fried/over-breaded and really greasy; particularly the calamari. Over-all I love the place though."
10601,43,3,1,2/8/2012,"I've been here twice and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. ˜The food is definitely tasty but a bit overpriced. I ordered the ropa vieja, a standard Cuban dish, and it was very good, but I would've preferred a larger portion for the price. There's not much if anything under $15 here. The restaurant is small so if there is sometimes a wait if you don't make reservations."
10602,43,5,1,1/21/2012,Excellent Sangria!! I miss hanging out here since I moved away from New Haven. Will bring my husband here for a date night sometime. The closest I've been to Cuba is Miami and this reminds me of Cuban in Miami. Intimate and casual. Good for many drinks and food.
10603,43,4,1,1/14/2012,"I wandered over to this place on my late lunch break one day. ˜I have passed by it a few times and it usually pretty full around dinner time. ˜It is kind of small, but cozy and neat inside. ˜There is a bar in the back and several small tables in the front. ˜I had never had Cuban food before so I went with the Soul sampler for lunch. ˜It was fantastic. ˜The appetizers on my sampler were very simple in their tastes (not complex and insanely spiced), but they were very good. ˜There was a papa rellena on the plate that fabulous. ˜It wasn't too greasy, or overly fried it was done very nicely. ˜There were also plantains which also cooked perfectly, not soggy and not overcooked. ˜The items came with this amazing salsa. ˜Despite being a habanero salsa, it wasn't too spicy, but it was fresh tasting and the mangoes put it on the sweet side. ˜They had a great list of drinks too, but since I did have to go to work I was unable to partake. ˜If you have never been here, and are looking for something different it is worth checking out."
10604,43,4,1,12/6/2011,"LOML and I both had sandwiches...she ordered Pollo Epanizado (chicken breast) and I went with Pan Con Pescado (tilapia). Both perfectly prepared with unique tastes and an interesting side salad. Fast and friendly service in a pleasant atmosphere. Can't wait to go back...finally, something different!"
10605,43,4,1,11/12/2011,Thumbs up! ˜Meal was very flavorful and good portions for the price! ˜Better than NYC Cuban places with good price! Friendly staff a plus!
10606,43,4,1,10/14/2011,Excellent Cubano sandwiches. Excellent salad. Eveything was very fresh. Service was a little weak when it came to refills for beverages. Glasses were completley empty and we were left waiting for a several minutes. All in all food was outstanding. Cute and very clean resturant.
10607,43,1,1,9/12/2011,"This place is sketchy. Don't be fooled by the quaint ambiance. The food is incredibly greasy and over seasoned. Their so called trademark mojitos are in no way balanced and have way too much syrup. I ate here three times (not by choice) and was disappointed each time. To add insult to injury, I was there with a few friends last year and a member of our party left his cell phone on the table. He noticed this twenty feet outside the restaurant and immediately went back in. It was late on a week night and there was one party of two (who looked like Yale professors) renaining and the phone wad gone. When questioning the bartender and waitstaff, nobody seemed to know where the phone wad. It was beyond obvious that the wait/bus staff took it. To make matters worse, my friend had people calling him at all hours for drugs because he kept the same number once he got a new phone. Shady place."
10608,43,5,1,9/6/2011,"If you are looking for friendly service and GREAT FOOD....you've got to try Soul de Cuba. Don't shy away from this cozy restaurant because you are deterred by a new cuisine. Each entree is beaming with flavors that do not disappoint anyone's palate. I have been to both the Hawaii restaurant and now I frequent the New Haven location on a routine-basis. I have a hard time recommending any one dish because each item I have tried has been spectacular. I've been delighted by following: empanadas (appetizers or desserts), ensalada de louisa, ensalada de tropicana, ensalada de pollo, soul cubano sandwich, fricase de pollo, pollo moderno, pollo de ajo y naranga, bistec palomilla, picadillo, ropa vieja, and salmon en mojo y miel. Suffice to say, I have almost sampled the whole menu. The drinks are also pretty good, but I won't lie I go there for the solely for the FOOD! And if your plate does not come with the platanos maduros...then order it on the side. It's delicious and it cleanses the palate for your next bite. Soul de Cuba also offers retail marinades and salad dressings from their signature dishes...so you can bring the awesomeness home."
10609,43,4,1,7/27/2011,"I love this place. ˜Excellent service and atmosphere. ˜Vegetarian/Vegan friendly. ˜They have a mojo tofu dish that is amazing, and if you don't want that they will happily recommend other veg options. ˜I highly recommend this place."
10610,43,5,1,7/19/2011,"OMG I couldn't believe it. I was very apprehensive coming here because I have been to the best Cuban restaurants in Miami. I really wanted a Cuban sandwich but it was after 5 and it was not available to my disappointment. My friend and I ordered the first 2 chicken dishes (fricassee and the fried cutlet with mango salsa). It was amazing!!!!! It was seasoned well and the fricasse was very tender and the fried cutlet was good as well. We ordered empanada for appetizer and that was good as well. Btw I am salivating as I am writing this review...anyway, I ordered a ""Cuban iced coffee"" and honey for $4 it was a rip off!!!! Do not get it. I should have ordered a sangria or mojito instead!"
10611,43,4,1,7/17/2011,"We came for brunch. I had the frittata de papa and a side of veggies. Both were very good. The frittata was two smallish slices filled out with some french bread slices and salsa. Tasty, but not very big. Other dishes looked more substantial, though. Service was polite and pleasant."
10612,43,4,1,7/3/2011,"Perhaps where I've frequented the most in New Haven. BEST sangria and BEST salad in town, in fact I haven't encountered any better sangria by far, so take your pitcher and pick up those wine-soaked fruits with the double straws. they have another spot in Honolulu Food (4/5) Star dishes: a. ensalada tropicana - my favourite salad, baby greens, fresh mango, bite-sized home fries (now eliminated unfortunately), seared shrimp & nuts, both refreshing and warm, always delightful b. tilapia or pulled pork between cuban bread for sandwich makes a healthy lunch c. rabo encendido - the oxtail bone literally melt in one's mouth d. others: ceviche, empanadas, yuca fries or simply sampler, then flan e. SANGRIA, can't help repeating in caps Ambience (5/5): small (hence make your reservation), cozy, full of interesting and moving photos Service (5/5): forever friendly, always nice to hang out by the bar and chat with the bubbly bar tender"
10613,43,3,1,6/16/2011,"So soul food of any kind is under suspicion in CT, but this place checks out. My friend that goes down to Florida quite regularly tells me he finds this restaurant lacking, but for me its pretty good I would suggest the Ropa Vieja, and I would give the bartenders a thumbs up too. The last empanada I had was not up to good street food par, as they should be, but everything is very pleasant, good atmosphere, and you will always be treated well. Buen Provecho!"
10614,43,5,1,5/20/2011,Ceviche as excellent - and cuba libre was better then I could have made myself!
10615,43,4,1,5/12/2011,"love this place. only cuban food in new haven! doesn't compare to that in miami, but this will fill my cravings!"
10616,43,3,1,5/2/2011,The setting is very intimate and cozy. ˜Great date place. ˜Food was far more filling than expected - one appetizer per person was a lot of grub! ˜Ox tails were full of flavor and a unique food choice to the area. ˜Chicken meals are cooked perfectly. ˜Avoid the Devil Crab - it is basically a crab eggroll with Red Hot sauce - too aggressive for the crab. ˜Rum drinks were excellent. ˜Pricing was acceptable for the food and service. ˜Friendly waitstaff.
10617,43,2,1,4/13/2011,"I've been to Soul de Cuba twice. ˜The first time, in 2010 I had a pretty good dinner that made me want to come back, and the mojito was one of the best I had ever tried. Fast forward to 2011. ˜My mojito was pretty good, except they used very old mint so I had a lot of mint flakes clogging up my straw. ˜My appetizer of the calamari had more breading than the actual squid and clearly they were using old and frozen calamari, instead of anything remotely fresh (yet my dinning companion had a delicious and clearly homemade empanada). ˜Both of our main dishes were disappointing - I had the pollo soul de cuba which was dry and the salsa was disgusting and inedible. ˜The only redeeming item on the meal were the plantains which were very good (although sliced a bit thick). ˜My companion had the pescado a la cubana (pan fried red snapper) and the snapper again was not fresh and was not remotely seared (it was an unappetizing shade of grey). The deserts were pretty good - tres leches cake and the flan. ˜But really the whole meal was incredibly disappointing and I'm not sure what has happened to the restaurant but it essentially a waste of money. ˜And if you are going to go, at least stay away from the seafood."
10618,43,4,1,4/12/2011,"First time here and the food was wonderful. Lechon Asado excellent, Mojitos almost as good as mine! Service was mixed...manager was terrific, wait service could be better. All four meals were nicely done. Place is very small so reservations are necessary. Enjoy!"
10619,43,2,1,4/8/2011,"Like other reviewers have mentioned, there was a bit of food with my grease. We ordered the papas rellenas, which were tasty, and the black beans and rice were delicious. However, the crispy calamari got sent back - too greasy. The bistec palomilla was tough and heavy on the mojo... if this is authentic Cuban, I didn't really enjoy it. As for the drinks, the mojitos were too sweet, I thought, but my friend enjoyed hers. The water had a weird smell, too. A few years ago, I tried this place for the first time and had a medianoche/cuban sandwich. I really wanted to like it. But the thing that stuck with me, literally, were the chunks of fat attached to the meat. I am from SoFLA, and would love, LOVE to be able to find a good medianoche around here (New Haven area), but this is probably not going to happen at Soul De Cuba."
10620,43,4,1,4/6/2011,"Had the Cuban sandwich today and it was wonderful! ˜The bread was perfectly light and crispy, the inner ingredients very fresh, love the pickle! Also had the tres leches cake for dessert, excellent."
9882,43,4,1,2/20/2011,"My mother and I dined here after seeing a wonderful play at the Yale Repertory Theater. Unfortunately we did not have a reservation and so we decided to do take out. I am so pleased with everything we tried. We shared the Soul Sampler. Deviled Crab...yummy!!! My mother had the Lechon Asada and I ordered the Pargo a la Cubana. I love pork and was pleased to find that the lechon was cooked to perfection and not at all salty. My red snapper was poached perfectly, smothered in onions and the white wine sauce was divine. We are looking forward to going back. Growing up in NY and visiting Tampa, FL each summer I always looked forward to eating the food of my mother's best friend Betty who's Cuban family made incredible meals all the time. Now I can have a little of that back."
10621,43,2,1,2/1/2011,"The Sangria is SO GOOD that gets this place most of the two stars I gave it. The food. oh gosh, Just awful. Greasy, salty and uninspired. I even tried this place a second time, just to make sure i didn't just catch a bad day. The Ropa Veja that everyone mentions is way overcooked as if its made in a big batch once a month and heated up every day ready to slop on the plate. (i tried it twice) All of the sides (no matter what dish you order) are the same boring under seasoned rice and beans. Thank goodness for the fried bananas, which although super greasy were in fact a delightful sinful treat. I just can't believe how highly people rate this place and in such a competive market as new haven how they stay in business?"
10622,43,5,1,1/16/2011,"As a cuban woman I have been searching high and low for a decent cuban place in CT and this was the best I found. The food is definitely not authentic but they take the same basic concept and make something pretty great out of it. For example the medianoche does not look like any medianoche I have seen before but after a couple bites I was hooked, same great flavor that I am use to from Miami. On the other hand I, the drinks are not very good, the sangria was pretty bad, I have to say my family makes it much better. My fiance's drink wasn't all that great either. The restaurant is really timy inside but it gives it a nice cozy feel. I will definitely be back...but i'll be bringing own sangria in my purse."
10623,43,4,1,1/7/2011,"Went with a chica friend for dinner and had a delicious time. Cute booths, cozy space, friendly service, and the food was tasty. I'm not sure how authentic it was, but those platanos made my stomach roll its eyes. Worth a shot if you're in the mood for something ""flairful."" And hey...when's the last time you got anywhere near Cuba...? I'm just sayin'. Give SDC a whirl!"
10624,43,4,1,12/1/2010,"I've always been very skeptical about this place. I had seen the prices and feared I'd overpay for an ""ok"" meal. Well, it is pricey but at least I experienced authentic Cuban cuisine. We ordered to take out and went to the park. I had a Cuban sandwich, which has a bit of a twist, but is delicious. Someone else in our group had ""rabo encendido"" (or ""hot ass""... no joking) and it was as tender as I ever had a ""rabo"", which I'm no fan of... the food, that is. The ceviche with mango I didn't like very much. I like mango and I love ceviche, but it didn't work together. A bit too South Beach for me. I'm sure I'll be coming here for some Cuban coffee and ""medianoche"" sandwiches."
10625,43,2,1,11/19/2010,"ok food. expensive for what it is. slow and crappy service. if you want to try cuban cuisine, this place will do, but not really a place you would return multiple times."
10626,43,3,1,11/16/2010,"3 stars for the yummy sangria. My entree, the roasted pork, was ok. I liked the entrees my friends chose better than mine. My fave on the table was the ""Soul de Cuba"". That chicken was delish. Maybe I will try something different when I go back."
10627,43,2,1,11/15/2010,"Yikes...this place is unbelievably greasy! Maybe I'm used to better Cuban food, but there was oil literally dripping from our dishes. As we left and walked around the side, we could see into the kitchen...we haven't been back since."
10628,43,4,1,11/15/2010,I really liked this place. ˜The food tasted fantastic. ˜The place is a tiny little building with only a half dozen tables or so and a bar in the back. ˜The waiter was nice and got to us in reasonable time. ˜Overall I really like how the food was presented and definitely how it tasted. I only give it 4 out of 5 stars because yes it's pretty expensive and the portion sizes are pretty small for the price. ˜I do recommend it during restaurant week though.
10629,43,3,1,10/8/2010,"good service tasty food music was a little too loud though, struggled to hold a conversation."
10630,43,4,1,7/27/2010,"Very nice Cuban restaurant in New Haven. Delicious chicken with rice and beans...good pork and beef dishes too. Absolutely knocked out by the Cafe Cubÿno and of course the mind-blowing ""Three Milk Cake"" (Bolo de Tr?s Leches?) ˜This is actually a good place for dessert-only if you're ever thinking about that after a show. Be sure to check it out."
10631,43,4,1,6/28/2010,"We went here mostly for Mojitos and weren't disappointed. To our delight the food was excellent as well. We had the tostones (fried green plantains) for an appetizer that were cooked just right and served with the house mojo, which is also available for sale by the bottle. For an entr?e I had the eggplant with a black bean side, which I highly recommend. I didn't know black beans could taste so good until I found Soul de Cuba. If you're looking for that dish on their website, it's not on the outdated Word document that's available for download, but it's on the menu in the restaurant. Be forewarned that the dining area is extremely small (5 tables crammed together) so there might be a wait."
10632,43,5,1,5/22/2010,I want a paternity test to make sure this place isn't my baby's daddy.
10633,43,4,1,5/19/2010,"Not totally authentic Cuban, but close! After having visited Versailles on Calle Ocho in Miami only a week before, I went with some friends after a gym workout to this place. We had heard some excellent reviews from others about this restaurant, so we were anticipating something good. The interior is actually pretty small, but the decorations in and around the entire establishment makes up for it! Love the conga drum in the center right by the bar. For Cuban food, this place is actually a bit pricey with most of the selections being over $15. The bocadillos (Cuban Sandwiches) is the best deal for lunch (all of them are $8). I ended up getting a pan de bistec con pollo (which happen to be a fried chicken sandwich). The bread was really well made, had a flaky but semi-hard crust on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The chicken was really good too. Not sure what kind of oil they used, but that with the combination of the batter made it flaky but juicy on the inside! Each bocadillo comes with either chips or salad. I opted for the salad. I was actually expecting generic iceberg lettuce with ranch, but they actually have really good prepared salad! Spinach, fresh onions, capers, with some light italian dressing. Good stuff. All in all it was a great meal for lunch. It was my first time trying a bocadillo sandwich, so I couldn't exactly judge how authentic the Cuban sandwich was. But looking at what my friends ordered, I wouldn't call this restaurant really authentic, but it gets 4 stars from me for trying. I would imagine it to be a bit difficult to gather fresh and true Cuban ingredients in New Haven anyways, but they did a fine job! They had some interesting cocktails on the drink menu, I will have to check this out when I come back next time!"
10634,43,3,1,5/15/2010,"I had just returned from a great trip to Miami where I had some delicious Cuban food - and was walking by this place with my fiance and we decided to stop in for lunch. ˜I was a little underwhelmed, and totally can't remember what I ordered. ˜My fiance liked his steak though, and the mojitos were decent. ˜ This is a cute little spot, and I think we'll give it one more try - but if you're looking for the best meal you've ever eaten, I'm skeptical you'll find it here."
10635,43,4,1,4/26/2010,"No matter your political allegiance Cuba is romantic. Whether it be a Batistan robber- baron's blonde daughter sunning herself year round beside an American owned hotel pool, or a bearded man in jungle fatigues loading his rifle for sake of an idealized egalitarian society: the images of Cuba are beautiful. We do not know if the Cuban people are happier with the abolition of democracy because Anthony Bourdain has yet to receive air clearance in order to inform us, but regardless, the food is a more welcomed export than Scarface's Tony Montana. Regardless of the rain we're always in search of a little revolutionary romance. We lit our Cuban cigars, unbuttoned our Hawaiian shirts, opened the umbrellas and strolled the puddled streets of New Haven towards Soul De Cuba. Before entering Soul de Cuba we saw the beautiful decor through the large glass windows. The muted orange walls hide behind many small black framed pictures of people, animals, and glimpses of Cuban life. Are they friends, relatives, or national heroes? We have no idea. All we know is that they are beautiful. The inside of the restaurant is small enough where thirty people can easily pack the place. The tiny five table dining room is divided from the bar by a conga drum and its raised display area housing the drum. You can look but can't touch; the drum is roped off. Who, we ask ourselves, would have the audacity to unsolicitedly provide their own dinner music? The music is funky, light, and unobtrusive. Hans dug it like Dr. Grant looking for a velociraptor's big toe, while Mendez wanted hard and heavy salsa music blaring. To his disdain requests were not being honored. Our personable server added warmth to our experience on this rainy day, a weather condition misconstrued as miserable. Water is refilled and a well trained eye knew when more beer was called for. We each ordered a soup appetizer and a sandwich. Like Salsa music, pork sandwiches are best served hot. For an even better pork sandwich serve it with a pickle and side salad. The sandwich's Swiss cheese drips down your chin, forcing you to take another bite for risk of looking like a fool. The black been soup is simple and priced right. If the word gets out it might replace Mamoun's for New Haven's cheap protein fix. Soul de Cuba is also home of Cristal: an immensely pleasurable light beer. Contrary to its name sake, those with good taste whom do not fabricate urban recording artists for reality television can enjoy this refreshment. The slight buzz and good company made eating the food twice as fun. Soul de Cuba is prime real estate in New Haven. A block over from the pseudo-intellectual/artistic/self-important clutter of Chapel St. and far enough from eternally juvenile nevereverland of clubs to be quiet and cozy. It's the type of restaurant one dreams of owning. We'd do the decor a little different and we'd roll our own cigars if given the opportunity (tobacco and non tobacco fillings). We'd keep the vintage Cuban magazine covers done over as cartoons. We'd keep the cigar box counter. We'd toss Teddy Roosevelt's smug portrait and burn effigies of William Randolph Hearst on the sidewalk. As we admired the restaurant out loud, praising it's location, our server said something that struck us as funny. We asked her to repeat it as to write it down. It was not until our Yahooligans! search that we realized her quote went unattributed. She said, ""Nine-tenths of the people were created so you would want to be with the other tenth."" Of course, being our readers, we don't have to tell you those words of wisdom were spoken by Horace Walpole, fourth Earl of Orfard, a man who may have bathed with pigs centuries before the Bay of Pigs. We did not understand why she would quote such a fellow until passing by the Yale Center for British Art where a collection of Walpole's Gothic junk is on display. High Culture is not beneath us, so we examined the museum. If you are a fan of paintings, particularly those of lavish green hillsides, mighty horses, lions sinking their teeth into horses, a horse on a lavish green hillside, or bridges (with and without horses), you will enjoy every minute of this rusty mausoleum. We're not saying not to visit, just keep in mind its like decaf tea with low sugar crumpets. For fans of spooky British literature visit the third floor for a heavy dose of Walpole. newhaveneatsit.blogspot.?"
10636,43,4,1,4/13/2010,"Cute place on the corner, if you're not feeling the J Crew prepsters crowd at Bar. ˜Limited seating so either get there early or make a reservation in advance. ˜The menu is pretty extensive. ˜I ate here once long ago but don't remember what I had. ˜A week ago I stopped by for some sangria. ˜Very soulful atmosphere. ˜Friendly staff with a sense of humor."
10637,43,3,1,4/13/2010,"Pretty good - walked over here w a colleague for dinner as it's pretty close to The Study. ˜For their size and what they were, empanadas were not cheap at $8 for two. ˜I ordered ""pollo soul de cuba,"" described as one of their signature dishes, and found it to be pretty good. ˜My colleague was less thrilled about her ""pargo con salsa de mango"" which she found to be somewhat cold. ˜ There seemed to be only one server covering the entire restaurant so the service was a little spotty. ˜I'd come back, but wouldn't be running over to do so."
10638,43,3,1,3/30/2010,"The food is pretty good, but not mind-blowing, and not worth the price. The atmosphere is nice, as you have probably noticed if you have walked by. If you don't mind spending the money, then by all means. Basically, it's overpriced for what it is, but probably worth it to try and see for yourself."
10639,43,3,1,2/26/2010,"Will not return. As a lover of Latin foods, I expected this chic-looking restaurant to deliver on the spirit, taste, and presentation of Cuban cuisine. Unfortunately, what we got was mostly sides of rice, beans, and mediocre plantains with some tasty but not extraordinary morsels of the main event. Both my girlfriend and I ordered the classic dishes, Ropa Vieja and Pollo Fricase, neither of which are complicated. Both were good, but not exceedingly so and did not match the restaurant's price point. Overall, the straw that broke the camel's back was on service. In the whole meal, our waiter appeared three times: to get pur drink order, again for food, and then to deliver the check. Thus, I could get this food at take-out prices with equally good service. It is the first out of dozens of New Haven restaurants I would assert to never return, at least for food. Caipirinhas and Mojitos are great but also overpriced."
10640,43,3,1,2/22/2010,"I'm torn. ˜The food is still great. ˜Since my last review, I have discovered that the entrees with rice, beans, and plantains are superior to sandwiches and salads. ˜The chicken fricase, the ropa vieja, the pinchos camarones - all very tasty, and the sides soak up sauces something beautiful. ˜Also great are the light ceviche and the hearty spiced up chili. Nevertheless, after my last visit, I will be hesitant to go back. ˜The service is consistently lackluster, a fact that I knew and accepted, but this time around it really tarnished my opinion of the restaurant. Two friends and I sat down for a 6:30 reservation, ordered our food, and dutifully ate while also indulging in some leisurely conversation, as paying diners are often wont to do. ˜One of my friends took her time with her meal and was still working on it after a waiter cleared the rest of our plates. ˜A few minutes later, he asked my friend if she wanted the rest of her dinner to go. ˜This is bad service - a slower eater should not be put on the spot in front of her friends. ˜Even so, this wouldn't have been worth an update on its own. At around 7:30, we got the bill and paid it. ˜As is generally allowed, we stayed at the table and chit-chatted, enjoying each other's company, not quite ready to leave. ˜It wasn't even 7:45 when another waiter came to our table and asked us to move to the bar so that they could start seating other parties who had reserved tables. We left instead. ˜Even as we were urged to vacate our seats, we noticed two empty tables across the room along with zero people attempting to sit in them. ˜Also present in this very small restaurant were at least two parties who had been seated longer. ˜But even if there were people in need of seats and we were the best candidates for booting - we had just paid upwards of $20 a person for admittedly good but still marked up home cooking. ˜I would assume that that price tag entitled us to a minimum of comfort and a fair amount of time at the table. ˜At the very least, an offer of free drinks at the bar for our troubles, but what we got was more of a relieved acceptance of our departure. Just as a side note to the management: to avoid any appearances of impropriety, I would advise you not to pick on the table occupied by three young women, two black and one Asian, especially if you're selecting a previously unseen white male server to do it. ˜If I were some sort of a hysterical yellow peril I might be wailing oppression all about the various institutions of gambling and higher education I'm likely to frequent. ˜So don't be rude, but if that can't be helped, there's no reason to be stupid about it, too."
10641,43,3,1,1/24/2010,Fair Cuban food -- ultimately fairly bland and boring. ˜Went a few months ago and probably won't go back.
10642,43,5,1,1/19/2010,"Disclaimer: I have never had authentic Cuban food. We switched our reservation around numerous times (including a few hours before the actual meal) and had no problems. Soul de Cuba is fairly small inside, but very comfortable. ˜Service was very attentive and our waiter was charming . We had the ceviche app which was delicious. I had the 'pollo soul de cuba.'. The mango salsa was perfect with the fried chicken, and everything was cooked to perfection. This is one of the best meals I have had in a restaurant recently and I would definitely recommend it."
10643,43,5,1,1/17/2010,"yes, I am shameless for reasonably priced and tasty food, and soul de cuba offers just that. Fricase de pollo is a must have. ˜The chicken is absolutely tender, moist, and flavorful. ˜In fact, we breezed through the chicken with just a fork, no knife needed, and that says a whole lot about a dish. ˜The portion is reasonable on both ends. If you are in the mood for something slightly heavier, pollo soul de cuba is a good option as well. ˜Good food + a pitcher of sangria= I was sold. ˜The only thing is that the space is small. ˜I recommend making a reservation rather then just showing up."
10644,43,3,1,11/30/2009,"Good food but overpriced for ""home-style"" Cuban food. I've been once and don't really plan to go back. But it is definitely worthy of a try, especially if you have never had Cuban-style food before."
10645,43,4,1,11/28/2009,"This place has some very good food. I acknowledge that it's not the best food ever or the most inventive food ever, but I always feel so good and comforted after eating here. And it's not too pricey; it's one of the few restaurants in New Haven that has entrees in between the ubiquitous Thai options and the numerous $20-30+ a plate options. I love the rice and beans, the plantains, and the solid choices they have for entrees. The bowl of chili is a giant portion for an appetizer, and the empanadas are good. The meat can be a little on the dry side, but it still tastes great. The space is quite cramped, and reservations are often necessary, but Soul de Cuba is a solid choice for a meal."
10646,43,3,1,11/12/2009,"My friends have raved about this place and its food to me for months. ˜I've been to Soul de Cuba several times over the past few years, and every single time I think to myself that I should hold out on judging it, maybe it wasn't a good day or something happened in the kitchen. ˜But that just isn't the case. ˜Soul de Cuba is good, but not exceptional. ˜Their food is comforting but not extraordinary, and the atmosphere is cozy but not homey. ˜Prices are decent, around the standard New Haven entree prices once you ignore the outliers of Union League, Ibiza, etc. ˜But it feels like I'm paying too much for half good comfort food that I should just make at home and half mediocre Cuban. This most recent visit was for lunch during restaurant week (which is supposed to showcase a restaurant, but I more often find restaurant week fare to be weaker than the usual). ˜We started with some chicken wings and bruschetta, neither of which tasted particularly Cuban or even Latin-inspired, but were fine. ˜Then my friend had the honey-lime glazed pork, I had the shrimp in spicy tomato salsa. ˜Both came with rice and black beans and fried plantains, which were really great, warm and tasty. ˜But the pork (as it has been every time I've come here) was too dry and overcooked, as was the shrimp. ˜I mostly ate my rice and beans, which while good, I could make at home. Our meal ended with the cuatro leches cake, which was actually quite tasty. ˜I could come back to Soul de Cuba for drinks (great mojitos) and the cake. ˜ ˜ Although it's the only Cuban place in New Haven, I'd rather go into New York or Boston for a cuban fix than this passable but not great restaurant."
10647,43,3,1,9/27/2009,"After hearing years of rave reviews I finally made it out here... maybe I had ridiculous expectations but it wasn't the knockout I thought it would be, especially for the price and the hype. It was at the very least good, though! It definitely adds variety to the New Haven dining scene. There's a wide variety of food, but there aren't really many options for vegetarians (I noticed since a vegetarian wanted me to let him know how it was). Surprisingly the service was kind of slow, considering how small the restaurant space is. However, the wait staff were very nice people. The ceviche appetizer was good as was the flan at the end. I thought the rice and bean sides were really tasty, too. I got red snapper cubano? for an entree but I didn't really like the sauce it came out in... it was a bit overly flavorful and I couldn't simply enjoy the fish. However, my boyfriend tried some and he really liked it so maybe it was just me."
10648,43,5,1,9/25/2009,The positive reviews are spot on. ˜Easily one of the top 3 restaurants in New Haven. ˜Don't forget to make a reservation!
10649,43,5,1,9/20/2009,"This was by far and away my favorite place to eat in New Haven. It's a small, quaint restaurant but the food is incredible! The pollo de cuba is definitely my fave and it's hard to really capture the essence of how much this dish rocks with words so just get it The chicken is so incredibly tender. The empanadas are among some of the better empanadas I've ever had and I lived w/ an Argentinian man who loved to cook. The plantains = amazing. Desserts are great here as well. Honestly, just go. I highly recommend it."
10650,43,5,1,7/8/2009,"OK, so don't let the last reviewer deter you, this is an awesome restaurant. She obviously doesn't know good food since she liked Claire's."
10651,43,2,1,7/7/2009,"If this is the only Cuban restaurant in New Haven, then I am sorry for all of the people sadly underexposed to good cuban food. ˜At is core, Cuban food should be super cheap and accessible to all people alike. It seems slightly misleading that with a name like ""Soul de Cuba"" neither of these apply to the place. The place itself serves food too pretentious to be Cuban food. ˜This is in no way an attack on Cuban food, because to me, Cuban food is all about good home cooked food, without compromising the flavor for anything (presentation or just adding things into the food to get an ingredient with a cool name into it). This place misses the mark. ˜The food is shaped into unnatural mounds, and while the meat isn't dry, it isn't pleasantly moist either---more of a mush. The empanadas are good, but the caramel one tasted like a caramel empanada from tacobell! Again *meh*. ˜ The place is cramped as could be, and despite having reservations, the people there were pushing our group into different corners rather than this one bigger table with a smaller table next to it. ˜ Not a place for me to revisit. ˜You may like it if you aren't familiar with Cuban food. ˜If you have grown up with Cuban food, you'll be dissapointed."
5168,43,5,1,6/28/2009,"This place gets extra points for *not* being another Thai or Italian restaurant in New Haven. ˜Not that there's anything wrong with those types of restaurants, but variety is the spice of life, or so they say. ˜I can't think of another cuban restaurant in the elm city. I went here for my birthday and overall had a fine experience. ˜Everything was great. ˜The black bean chili was perhaps the best chili I every had. ˜The prices were reasonable with only two entrees priced over $20. ˜The topper of the night was the tres leches desert which was white sponge cake drenched in three types of milk. ˜Perhaps I have been living under a rock all these years, but I honestly never had it before. ˜It was delicious and because it was served chilled it sort of tasted like ice cream. ˜The tres leches might be reason alone for me to make a return trip to Soul de Cuba in the future."
10652,43,5,1,6/2/2009,"Love this place. It's small with a cosy, hip buzz. They have some wonderful folks in the kitchen judging by everything we've ˜tried, from empanadas, the salad with yucca and shrimp, ˜devil ˜crab appetizers and the pan con pescado, a hot sandwich of fish sauteed in a really tasty sauce on acuban roll. I didn't try any entrees yet but they look good on the plates I saw go by to other tables. ˜The best margaritas and mojitos around New Haven by far. Next time I'm trying the sangria."
10653,43,5,1,5/15/2009,"Yay. ˜ After all of the things that I have heard about this place, I finally got the chance to go! Yes, it is a little bit more on the expensive side, but by the time you are half-way finished with your main course, you definitely will not have room for dessert. ˜The value of the food at any given restaurant is very important to me when I rate, and Soul de Cuba doesn't disappoint. I would highly recommend the Ropa Vieja. ˜The flavor was delicious, and the meat was so tender. ˜The empanadas are also the best that I've had in a while. The only downside was that it was small, and so reservations are a must. ˜However, that's no reason to take of a star. ˜I'll definitely be going back!"
10654,43,4,1,4/15/2009,"Food was good but service was slow -- something I have come to expect from almost all New Haven restaurants. ˜Not ideal when you are trying to squeeze in lunch during the workweek, but the food [I ordered the ropa vieja] was certainly flavorful and filling enough for me to come back on a day I'm less rushed. Note: they are closed Mondays!"
10655,43,5,1,4/1/2009,"This is my go-to restaurant in New Haven. Whenever I have friends or family come to town, this is where I take them out to eat. The food is always delicious and I love the cozy feel of the space. The best entree on the menu has to be the ropa vieja. The meat is tender and juicy and the sauce is just the right consistency - not too thick or too thin. I'd also recommend the pollo soul de cuba and the arroz con pollo - both are wonderful. This is also a great place for lunch - the cuban sandwiches rock! They're warm and toasty - you leave feeling ready to tackle the rest of the work day. As for drinks, I'm a big fan of the sangria - the perfect combination of wine and fruit that's had time to marinate together. Unlike some places that have sangria-like beverages - this is the real deal. And don't forget dessert - I always order the guava empanandas and a piece of tres leches cake. The perfect endings to a perfect meal!!"
10656,43,5,1,2/17/2009,"I can't believe I lived in New Haven for four years without hearing about this place! Serious yum. I had the ropa vieja, as well as the beef empanadas, and would have definitely had dessert if I hadn't been so full! The restaurant is intricate, cozy, and delightful-- prices are good for the quality and amount of food, and our servers were incredibly friendly. There isn't a lot of space in the restaurant, so it's probably best to make a reservation or else you'll end up waiting outside. I'm coming back here soon! The drinks look good too, maybe for a Friday evening with friends."
10657,43,4,1,1/27/2009,"I would certainly recommend Soul de Cuba for a date or getting together with a friend. After hearing some great reviews from friends about Soul de Cuba, I was excited to be taken on a date there this past weekend. We were glad to have a reservation - the dining area was tiny and packed, especially considering it was a Sunday night in New Haven (not exactly a time to expect huge crowds). Our servers were very friendly, y la comida estaba muy sabrosa! Started off with the calamari, which came with some great sauces, and had the Pollo Soul de Cuba for an entree. The salsa on the chicken was fantastic, we ate the whole thing pretty quickly. One of the definite highlights of the evening, though, was the mojito. Yummmm! Too bad the pitcher costs so much!"
10658,43,4,1,1/14/2009,"Cute spot! Great Cuban food! The restaurant is tiny though, which could make it uncomfortable if you're on a date and want privacy. Otherwise, it's great for a ""catch-up"" with a friend over dinner and drinks. Highly recommend it for the food!!"
10659,43,3,1,12/29/2008,"Driving back to NYC from MA, we were hoping to grab a burger at Louis' to find they were closed. We popped into this place for a late lunch. I ordered the pan con pescado, which was good, was hoping for a bit more flavor. I ordered a side of the steamed vegetables, which were outstanding! did not leave a single green pepper or onion on the plate. my boyfriend ordered the arroz con pollo, which was a plate full of rice, beans and chicken, very good. the prices were very fair, the restaurant small, but not cramped. each table has a very long story of how the restaurant came to be, which was fun to read while waiting for our meal."
10660,43,3,1,12/22/2008,Every meal I've had here has been decent. ˜My only complaint is about my most recent trip where it was super cold inside - everyone had to wear their coats - including the bartender. ˜When we complained they said that it would get hotter when the kitchen got hotter. ˜Say what?! ˜I don't care how good the food is - unless you're camping - I want to be warm while eating!
10661,43,2,1,11/4/2008,"I went there tonight and base on other review I have high expectation of the place. Unfortunately my Mojito was bland and pollo (chicken) was dry. I really expect better food give the price they charge, compare to Cuban place in Florida this place has an long long way to go."
10662,43,4,1,10/20/2008,"My girlfriend and I recently found ourselves wandering around New Haven looking for dinner on a late Sunday afternoon. We finally settled on checking out this place -- SO glad we did. What great food. We shared a salad for starters (I want to say it was called ""Louisa's Salad"") that incorporated lettuce, red onions, avocado, tomato and a honey balsamic vinaigrette. Awesome. I had the Pollo Soul de Cuba, and my girlfriend had the Camerones de Pina. Incredible, strong flavors, and very filling without the ""heaviness"" of something like Italian food. Reasonably priced for what you get. Can't wait to go back."
10663,43,5,1,10/5/2008,"After living in Miami for several years, I began taking $6 Cuban dinners for granted. ˜So when I moved to the Elm City this summer and I checked out the Soul de Cuba menu online, I was shocked to see the prices. ˜I wasn't trying to pay near $20 for pork, beans, and rice no matter how much I love that plate. My birthday came around a few months after the move and finally I could justify shelling out a little more for the Cuban food I craved, ˜I found right away that this food is NOT overpriced, nor is it the everyday mom-and-pop cuban joint I'd grown accustomed to. ˜The food was phenomenal, the cozy setting was perfect for a close-friends birthday dinner, and the food came out quickly and was still burning hot. It was well worth the 50 minute wait on a Sat night. ˜My dinner guests and I loved our meals. ˜I had the camarones con pina-- it was unbelievable/off the chain/orgasmic. ˜My four guests agreed that it was the best meal in New Haven they've had to date-- we had the pollo mojo, arroz con pollo, Soul de Cuba chicken, and another shrimp dish. ˜ The beef empandas for an appetizer and the tres leches for a dessert didn't disappoint. ˜ The mojito pitcher is reasonably priced-- I've had them cost as much as $80 in Miami, (Soul's is $40), but overall it was unbalanced and mostly limey. ˜The mint and sugar weren't there... it was pretty sour."
10664,43,3,1,10/3/2008,"Based on the other reviews, I expected to almost see God when I had the food at Soul de Cuba. ˜As it stands, it was good. ˜It was good, and I'd go again, but not necessarily with any great anticipation. ˜ The restaurant was cute and well done, made you feel nice and cozy inside. ˜The wait staff was friendly and competent. ˜The food was good, not great. ˜All in all, it was a pleasant experience, ""A-OK"" as the 3-star rating is described by Yelp. We had a pitcher of the sangria, which I enjoyed. ˜That was pretty delish, though a tad pricey. ˜I had the Ropa Vieja, a Cuban classic, and the husband had Soul de Cuba Pollo (I think that's what it was called). ˜The Ropa Vieja was a bit tough, my jaws were tired by the end of the meal from chewing all that meat, which I had expected to be very tender. ˜The rice was good and fluffy, but in the end it's just white rice. ˜And the platanos maduros were fantastic, but they were just a side and 3 little pieces, not exactly making or breaking the entree. ˜Husband described his food as, ""Good, but in the end it was some fried chicken with rice."" ˜We decided that the food was really worth a few bucks less for each entree. So, would we go again? ˜Yes, but it's not like we can't wait."
10665,43,5,1,8/28/2008,"I am a huge fan!!! The food is exquisite. If you like South American flavors, or are trying it for the first time, you will not be disappointed! The portions are large and there are so many extras and desserts, so bring your appetite. Try the Tres leches cake for dessert, you will love it!! Very tiny space, but this only adds to the atmosphere."
10666,43,4,1,8/3/2008,"What this place lacks in space, they certainly make up for with awesome food! ˜Our waitress informed us that they did not have the soup of the day or the oxtails, but we didn't miss either. ˜The chicken empanada appetizer was fantastic! ˜Our main entrees: ˜ropa viejos and pollo Sol de Cuba disappeared off our plates quickly. ˜Everything was very reasonably priced. ˜I would highly recommend checking out Soul de Cuba! ˜ I can't wait to go back."
10667,43,4,1,8/3/2008,Solid eats. Two of us walked in at 6pm on a Saturday and the place started filling up from there. Reservations are recommended. Chicken Empanadas as an app were on point and the Ropa Viejas (beef w/peppers and onions in a slightly spicy sauce) and Pollo Sol de Cuba (crisply cooked tasty chicken with a mango bean salsa) were better than I imagined reading the menu. Add some fried plantains and you cant go wrong. We got out of there full for a relatively good price. Worth it.
10668,43,4,1,4/10/2008,"It's been a couple of years since i ran through New Haven. ˜Back when lil' sis was just figuring out where she wanted to go to become an amazing CSI. Seriously. ˜She is an investigative genius with a heart full of passion and drive. Anyway, this is the first restaurant we ate at on this trip and it was d'lovely. Great, warm vibe--A little spot with a lot of character. ˜They were accomodating 2 groups of 6-10 and the place was packed at 7pm on Wednesday. ˜The 3 of us did not have reservations so the 10-minute wait we were quoted actually was about 30 minutes, but we passed the time with a sangria, a mojito and a dark n stormy. ˜The yelp reviews before me do not lie...the sangria is yum--not too sweet, just the right sized fruit. We tried the chicken empanadas. Excellent. ˜Being of Argentine descent and a lover of pastry in general, I have expectations of empanadas. The fried cuban versions were excellent: flaky pastry, fried to perfection full of delectably seasoned and moist chicken filling. Between appetizer and entrees we tried a rum sampler. ˜Now, I am sure there is a way to fully enjoy a rum tasting, but to me, it is still rum. ˜I detected a difference between them...one was smokier, one was sweeter. ˜The place apparently was out of one of the rums of the trio we selected, so our waitress substituted another rum in its place. ˜The fact that she didn't indicate which was which reinforced my thought that there is no need to get so fancy with rum. ˜However, it is a fun thing to do with friends and I am always willing to learn something new, especially when it comes to alcohol. We each ordered a different entree: bistec palomilla: excellent flavor, small serving of beef, good maduros (i've never really been a fan of these except with sourcream); my camarones de pina was tasty, but the yucca let me down a tiny bit; the pollo soul de cuba was by far the winner. ˜It is their signature dish for good reason. Get this!! Overall, the food is excellent, the drinks are crafted with love, and our service was right on the money. ˜The wait was a little long, but the ambiance and charm and food(!) made it all worthwhile. ˜Make a reservation."
10669,43,5,1,2/9/2008,"I am now in love with this restaurant. After reading all the fantastic reviews on here, we headed over to Sol de Cuba last night. Everything you hear is true!!!! We had a reservation, but sat at the bar for a few minutes--I had a mojito and the boy had a dark and stormy--so yummy! The bartenders were great--really friendly and laid back. When we got our table, we looked over the menu and decided what to order. We ended up with beef empanadas and fried plaintains for an appetizer. The beef empanadas were sooo tasty--but the plaintains were a little bland. For dinner, I had the Pollo Sol de Cuba--oh my god. SO good!!!!! ˜I can't remember the name of what the boy had, but it was ground beef, rice and plaintains--he really enjoyed it. The portions are HUGE too....you will definitely be filled up. ˜We did manage dessert--we couldn't decide which empanada we wanted to try (guava and mango), so the waitress gave us one of each--very tasty. We both loved the feel of the place and it just felt so inviting. ˜Our whole meal was only 79 dollars too--including drinks and tip. SO worth it!!! I will definitely be back and will be telling people about this place!"
10670,43,4,1,1/11/2008,"Based on the Yelp reviews my family and I visited Soul de Cuba last Saturday evening at around 5:00 pm and were seated right away - thanks Nicolette H.! ˜The reviews are all true! ˜We tried the empanada appetizer (exquisite), the Pollo Sol de Cuba (fragrant plantains and flavorful fruit salsa). ˜Steve had the pulled pork entree which was excellent. ˜My daughter and husband finished the meal with flan (first time for both) and were quite satisfied. ˜Thank you everyone for the recommendation."
10671,43,5,1,1/8/2008,This was the first meal I had my first night in New Haven and I keep going back. I spent a year in Cuba and the food quickly became one of my favorites. I was elated to see that the choices here were so similar to the food I had eaten in the country itself. The mojito which I am a huge critic of since EVERYONE has one these days was authentic and worth the price tag. I do agree with some of the other postings as the space is small and I have only seen this restaurant empty at 5:00pm. This is an excellent first date spot. I speak from success!
10672,43,3,1,1/2/2008,"food is pretty good . ˜it is fresh tasting and reasonably priced. ˜atmosphere is fun and low-key, but can be crowded. ˜the service ˜is almost always lacking. ˜but, it is the best (only?) place for cuban food in new haven. the sangria is delicious, and really does taste like juice. ˜however, it's not very strong (and i'm a serious lightweight). ˜if you want strong sangria, go to chow."
10673,43,5,1,11/17/2007,"Te amo Soul de Cuba. Everything I've ever eaten within the cozy walls of this restaurant has been delicious. The wine and rum selection is good, and their mixed drinks aren't bad (though Pacifico has them beat on mojitos, I think). The atmosphere is adorable. Photos of Cuban men with cigars and old street scenes keep the eyes occupied while your date's using the bathroom. I've taken good friends and small groups here, and it's perfect for a date or lunch with the 'rents. Yucca fries, ceviche, ropa vieja, their signature chicken, the black bean soup, I can't complain about any of it. Nothing is very spicy, which may be a problem for some, but I can go either way. If it's your first time, try a combination of traditional and experimental dishes. You can't really go wrong."
10674,43,4,1,8/10/2007,"Nice and easy going place with really tasty Cuban food. Most entree comes with delicious fried plantains. It's basic food that tastes like a home-cook meal, if you have a Cuban/Puerto Rican mom, that is... This place, at least in my opinion, rivals Cha Cha Cha on the Haight in Frisco, minus the crazy crowd."
10675,43,3,1,7/15/2007,"I liked my oxtails and rice - smooth as butter and just as rich. ˜ Someone I was eating with said the food was too bland. ˜I'm no expert on Cuban food, but I've had it in a few different places and its always been kind of mild, hearty, garlicky, home cooking . . . so I don't know. On a second trip, I had shrimp with capers and tomato sauce. Seafood in tomato sauce is something I order (intentionally or by accident) at almost every place I go, if they have some variation of it on the menu. This was interesting - hot and spicy and with a great lemony-sour bite from the capers. I've also shared the mojito pitcher here - it's good - and had the sangria - also good, but not any better than you could make yourself. Reviews for soul de cuba from when it opened seem to quote lower entree prices, and it does seem a little expensive - it's Cuban diner food at twice the price."
10676,43,5,1,7/6/2007,"This is by far the BEST cuban/latin restaurant in New Haven. The food is authentic (tastes like Miami, Puerto Rico, and Cuba all in one) , the drinks are fabulous (I love the mojitos and the sangria!) and their selection of wine and rum is superb. Go for a rum tasting! Delicious! The atmosphere is fun and inviting, and if you're lucky you'll experience some latin dancing and some fabulous fun conversation, since the place is small and inviting enough to make everyone friends by the end of the night!"
10677,43,4,1,4/1/2007,"a very cozy, warm spot that serves delicious food. it's tiny, with great ambiance, food, and drink. my absolute faaaaaaaavourite thing here is the sangria - it tastes just like juice! ˜but be careful, because it's a bit more mood-altering than your typical juice. i have been here for drinks, and dinner only once, but have left happy and satisfied each time. ˜the dishes seem so simple, but manage to tantalize the palate with complex and novel flavours. ˜i highly highly highly recommend the fricassee de pollo. ˜the chicken was cooked and seasoned to absolute perfection. ˜my dinner mates and i could not stop raving about what a great choice we made. i have decided this will be my default pre-theatre locale. ˜it's so close to the yale theatres AND yale rep members get 15% off their dinner bill! ˜you can't beat that. also... ˜if you go there, try to get liz as your waitress. ˜she was great fun, she definitely went above and beyond the duties of sufficient service. ˜she enabled our drinking, but was also looking out for our safety, making sure we were walkign to the theatre and not driving in our drunken states. AND... ˜you have to promise to try the sangria!!!"
10678,44,1,0,9/26/2010,I went to Jojo's wed night with 3 other people.. Their food is great! I have always been a fan of jojos and have reccomended jojos to others.. Not anymore.. they have some of the worst waitresses ive ever had serve me there! Nancy is the on in particular i am talking about.. HORRIBLE!!! and she is an owners sister!She was rude never asked us if everything was ok and never asked us if we wanted another drink.. and when i asked for one she said ok but you guys will have to find another place to sit after this i have people coming in at 830 and they want this table.. WOW!! there were other free tables.. we were paying customers.. My gf asked for a beer and she said no we had to move.. ˜MY gf by the was has been a waitess for over 18 years! ˜we saw extra tables and asked why we had to move.. she said well i can seat you at another table.. but that was after the fact of her asking or no telling us to move.. My gf said shes never seen anything like this.. if she had asked us prior and said hey i have people who like this table c do you mind moving over here we would have moved.. but she didnt.. she said Im sorry but i have to take care of them they come in every night and take care of me! wow.. what a horrible experience we had.. NEVER ever will i go there again.. Ive told several people and they know all about NANCY!!!! shes bad for business..and several people said before i even told them who.. oh yeah the older women there are horrible!!! oh well..!! Delorenzos on Hudson is where i will go.. great food great people there too!!!
10679,44,1,0,10/3/2009,"I have to agree with most of the reviews. We have loved JoJo's since JoJo himself was around and young!! The food is fabulous..gotta say! Kudos to the chef, but the new ""JoJo""(sorry JoJo! I know there will never be another JoJo!! Miss U!) his name is Carmen..the son ; he is rude, unfair, unorganized and insulting. He seats his peeps (which is his prerogative; it is his place) and leaves people with reservations waiting for and hour and a half.. Good luck with parking and seating...we won't be back...I like a place that appreciates (at least a little) our money.."
10680,44,1,0,5/26/2009,"We finally managed to get ˜into Jo Jo's Tavern to try the oft raved about food. ˜We found the pizza tasteless- although the crust was mostly nicely crispy, the sauce had NO flavor and it doesn't hold a candle to Palermos or DeLorenzo's. ˜The antipasta was nothing more than a pedestrian tossed salad (lettuce/tomato, carrots) ˜with way too mild cheese (provolone??) and a very bland salami- not a garlicky spiced salami that shoudl be in antipasta. ˜No ham, no peppers, no olives, not chopped. ˜Extremely Disappointing. ˜We ordered a very basic plate of spaghetti & meatballs just to see if the sauce/gravy was authentic Italian. ˜DO NOT go to Jo Jos for this very basic of dishes (or other dishes??) - the sauce was a cross between Ragu and Tomato Juice and the meatball was just ""OK"". ˜$12 for a few ounces of pasta and 1 meatball. What is all the hoopla about and why are people going in droves to Jo Jo's???? ˜Maybe too many people ""want to belong"" and nobody wants to buck what's ˜popular but not really worth their hard earned dollars. ˜Sorry."
10681,44,1,0,9/19/2008,"I've been to Jo-Jo's many times. ˜I know they have their regular customers and that's nice. ˜But the regulars have their own reserved tables and the last time I was there not only was I asked to move my table but others were also. ˜All to accomodate people that get upset if they don't get their usual table. ˜ I will say the pizza is good (probably the best thing on the menu). ˜ But unless you are a regular the service is so so and you ae igored. No thanks I'll pass. ˜There are plenty of good places eager to take my money and treat me better. Oh one more thing, there isn't enough parking."
10682,44,3,0,4/12/2014,There is just not enough room in here to be comfortable. Getting a table or a seat at the bar is tough. ˜Make a reservation if you plan on eating here; becaise it always crowded and people stay for a while after eating. The food is descent but not worth how long it takes to be brought out. ˜The pizza is good and as a bar its good; but it needs to be a bigger space and the food needs to come out faster to get a better review. The staff is very nice .
10683,44,3,0,7/2/2012,Decent pizza...the place itself could use a facelift. Service also
10684,44,3,0,2/17/2012,"I recently went to the Tavern for the first time. We waited 45 minutes before being seated. After sitting, we did not have a waitress for 15 minutes. The antipasto was huge! The hamburger was certainly NOT medium well. The pizza was good, however just as good as any other bar pizza. Would definatly not go on a busy weekend ever again.Oh! I forgot to mention that we couldn't park behind the restraunt and had to park rather far away in the snow :("
10685,44,4,0,11/14/2013,Seating is tight and it's always noisy. Just know that going in.Burgers are good and I really enjoy the bar pies. ˜Always found the staff to be really helpful and friendly.
10686,44,5,0,11/26/2013,"Great atmosphere for football; better tomatoe pies (""Clams Casino Pizza"" worth a try...tasty specialty pie, and $3.50 bar pies Sunday/Football)...what's not to like!?"
6016,44,5,0,8/21/2013,"Love Jo-Jo's! ˜Place has the best bar pies around, incredible drinks...and if they have the lamb...get it! ˜I know, lamb at a tavern? ˜Sounds crazy, but it's incredible! ˜Be sure to get there early, or you'll have to fight for a spot, as the place is always packed!"
10687,44,5,0,4/2/2013,Hands down the best Pizza in the greater Trenton area. I especially love their bar pie with sausage. The other offerings on their menu are a slam dunk also. Seating is tight.
10688,44,5,0,1/11/2013,"Best pizza in town.... period. ˜ Great crust, great flavor, great sausage and mushrooms, all fresh... Got takeout, took home and put in the over on a cookie sheet to keep warm. ˜Stayed crisp and delicious. Thank you guys for a really great pie! ˜(Better than that ""D"" place down the street!)"
10689,44,5,0,9/25/2012,"The pizza at Jo Jo's is hands-down the best in the area, even better than Delorenzos which I think is way, way, overhyped. Now mind you, the place is a little small but you can really enjoy a nice meal without breaking the bank in a cozy atmosphere."
10690,44,5,0,8/5/2012,"They keep opening chain restaurants in the area and jojos still is the best. Great food, decent pricing, fun neighborly atmosphere."
10691,44,5,0,7/19/2012,Best pizza in the area by far. The crust is unique!
10692,44,5,0,6/23/2012,"love jo-jo's, love mike the bartender & LOVE the bar pie! it always feels like i am going to home or to cheers!! thanks for being the hamilton counterpart to contes!"
10693,44,5,0,2/8/2012,If you are a take out service you need to offer utensils and paper plates with the takeout. ˜Some companys do not have a kitchen and it would be very helpful to offer them. ˜I purchased soap and asked for a spoon and was told they did not have any. ˜I had to go to the 7-11 and take on. ˜ Not really good service. ˜Food is great
10694,44,5,0,12/18/2010,"We have been going to JoJo's for more than 10 yrs., It is our most favorite place. ˜Yes its always crowed but that is part of the fun of it. ˜ We always have a big smile and happy time being there. ˜ The food is the absolute best. ˜ Whatever you order, expect a great meal. ˜We always have a great deal of fun, overtime we go there, which is quite often."
10695,44,5,0,2/1/2010,Best bar pies (pizzas) in Mercer County.
10696,44,5,0,10/20/2008,"R.B. ARE YOU KIDDING!!! ˜You must have little dining experience in the area if you don't realize that JO JO's is WAY under estimated and under-valued. ˜We have been empty nesters for many years and go out most every night to eat. ˜Everything from RATS to taco bell; from the Grotto in Newtown to Havanna's in New Hope; from POD or Morton's in Philly to Tavern on the green in NYC. ˜We have met people at the bar that drove from NYC to have pizza at Jo Jo's because it was so good - truth!! ˜The fish is always fresh and perfectly cooked. ˜The vodka rigatoni is BEYOND COMPARE - nothing even comes close!! ˜The mussels are meaty and never sandy. Simple things like their mini tacos are awesome. ˜Try a chicken parmigiana sandwich or their eggplant parmigiana sandwich (without the bread - my preference) is like my mother cooked. ˜Jo Jo's special chicken is just AMAZING!!! Their desserts - well their desserts are --- fantastic - try the brownie Sunday - enough for 4 people. ˜ Their drinks are well worth it!! ˜Not a 1/2 shot like other area bars. ˜Mary Ellen has been a bartender in the area for quite a while, can handle any number of patrons, and makes a fantastic drink!! ˜Even the entertainment is fun (though I don't like the Karaoke czar and his groupies on Wednesdays). ˜The ONLY area where they could improve is their beef purveyor. ˜It is good but not a Ruth Chris / Marsha Brown / KC Prime. ˜I prefer thick cuts. ˜ SO I must assume that you enjoy Applebees or Charlie Brown's routinely or else you would realize that Jo JO's is central Jersey's secret hot spot. Our 2 cents, M&M"
10697,44,5,1,12/31/2014,First - got to order the fried zucchini sticks. There terrific. ˜Great thin pizza and home cooked entrees. Just love going here just wish there was more parking.
10698,44,4,1,12/14/2014,"Very small place with limited parking, but great menu with excellent pizzas and Italian fare made from fresh ingredients."
10699,44,5,1,8/30/2014,"Jo-Jo's Tavern was our post softball league hangout for years when we had our games on the Mercer County Community College campus. ˜It was close. ˜It was cheap. The pizza was great. ˜The crowd was raucous. We might have to wait a while for the pies we ordered, but that gave us time to rehydrate ourselves with whatever was on tap, and tell wild tales about our exploits. ˜ So, when I stopped in last week for a late lunch around 2:00, I was surprised that only a couple of tables were occupied and there were less than 6 people sitting at the bar. ˜It was the exact opposite of what I was accustomed to. It was quiet enough to have a good conversation at the bar. ˜In fact, we spoke in hushed tones so the others across the bar could not hear us. I kept it simple. ˜Plain bar pie with a $2 Rolling Rock draft special of the day. ˜The first crunching bite reminded me why I loved Jo-Jo's pizza. ˜Thin crust; firm and crisp. ˜Semi-sweet sauce with a hint of Basil, Enough Mozza to balance the sauce with the mildly salty cheese. The blending flavors while chewing captured my attention in a way that only the best tomato pies do. ˜ On my reacquaintance tour of pizza of this part of Trenton/Hamilton, Jo-Jo's pie is at the head of the class (so far). Bar Pie and Draft for under $9. is a great and tasty deal."
10700,44,5,1,8/27/2014,"YES! YES! YES! Jo-Jo's Tavern is the place to be. I was in the area for the week and heard interesting things about Jo-Jo's and the playful ribbing of customers. When I was there, I didn't see any ribbing and the staff was fantastic! They made sure I was comfortable and taken care of. I had the daily special of Maryland Clam Chowder, which came with bread. It was amazing. I also had the Clams Casino Bar Pie. The clams were difficult to detect but they actually have real bacon on the pizza and they were sizable pieces. The food tasted great and the portions were priced appropriately. If you want somewhere that treats you like you're family and you belong, go to Jo-Jo's. It's impossible to not have a good time there."
10701,44,4,1,8/17/2014,"When it comes to bar pies, Jo-Jo's has it down to a science. The pies are amazing and consistent. We've patronized this place for over 2 years now and the kitchen has never had an off-day in the baking department. The pies have a good ""meaty"" bite to them from the layer of cheese, tomato sauce and the crust (which is what makes the pies so good. Not too thin, not too thick, just right). When it comes to the choice of pies, we swear by their mustard pie with no additional toppings (one has to try it to decide whether one likes it or not). For the mustard, one has a choice of spicy or yellow. If you decide to order a regular pie, we'd recommend sausage and fresh garlic for the choice of toppings. The sausage has a very good flavor from the seasoning and the fresh garlic goes really good with it. When the pies arrive, we'd recommend a generous sprinkle of garlic powder that they have at each table to give the pies more oomph (for garlic lovers). Each bite is sheer bliss. We've tried take out once and our verdict is that the pies taste best when they come right out of the oven. Every rose has it's thorn. Parking can be a pain where ""the sun don't shine"". Seating is tight during peak hours and especially on Fri and Sat."
10702,44,4,1,6/2/2014,"I think this place is great. It reminds me of hanging out in my parents' basement (they have a bar). The place is in a house structure - doesn't get more ""hangin' out at home"" than that (well, except for staying shut in at home). As I grew up in Princeton, I understand how the classy folk might find fault in this place (and perhaps this review). As such, I'm going to provide the following five-prong coat rack upon which you can hang your pretentiousness at the door: 1) Seating is tight. Be it at a bar or a table, you will be close to strangers. Wear deodorant. 2) Service is efficient and as friendly as it can be considering this place is normally jam packed on the weekends. 3) The parking lot is probably full. Park next door and stop complaining. 4) Don't get dressed up to come here. Just don't. No one will appreciate it. In fact, it will be frowned upon. Finally... 5) This place is NOT meant to be fancy. It's a neighborhood joint. The food is good and the drinks are excellent. I'm a craft beer snob. Mike nails the selection to a T. Further, Jo-Jo's does frequent tap takeovers - it behooves you to get in the loop. My only disappointment with this place is that there's no outdoor seating which would be great during the summer months."
6687,44,4,1,2/19/2014,Hard to find parking sometimes but the food is good. Get the tomato pie and a few rounds of beer and you will be satisfied. Take out orders are a pain though it is best to try to eat here.
10703,44,4,1,2/13/2014,"Went for lunch after reading the positive reviews. ˜Atmosphere was warm and inviting. ˜ Patrons was a mixed crowd (both young and older). ˜I sat at the bar and had their daily special Yueling@ $2.50. ˜They have I guess a daily lunch special menu which I noticed didn't have their famous pizza pie so I opted for the 1/2 lb angus burger @$7.50. ˜Its good they ask how you like your burger cooked as most places makes it well done (I opted for medium). ˜ Waited about 10 mins and burger was pretty huge, came with non greasy fries (from frozen) which was nice and crispy. ˜The angus burger was really good not dry and cooked perfectly. ˜Unlike some other burger joints, the buns were grilled on one side to retain it's hold from ˜breaking apart as you eat which I like. ˜ As I was finishing devouring this great burger, a patron (I suspect a regular) a few stools from me had the famous pizza pie and I asked him how he managed to order it since I didn't see it on the menu and really came for this. ˜He said you just have to ask for it and offered me a piece which I kindly declined as I just finished my 1/2 lb burger and fries. ˜ I'll def come back again this time like a regular and order the pie and give you my feedback. ˜ I'll give this a 4.5 stars and deduct a 1/2 star for not them putting the famous pizza on the menu which they should have."
10704,44,5,1,8/31/2013,"We've been going here for years, and feels like home everytime. ˜Nothing fancy inside, can probably use some remodeling, but food and beers are great, especially for such a casual place. ˜Wings are some of the best around and pizza delish!"
10705,44,5,1,8/20/2013,"We tried this place on a whim. ˜It is awesome. ˜Cheese steaks are one of the best around; chicken parmesan was very good; and the pizza was the best I've had in a long time. ˜Service was wonderful, even though the place was crowded."
10706,44,4,1,7/2/2013,"The bartender Mike has a knack of knowing what we were drinking last time, and when you arrive at the bar, he has a couple of craft beers for us to try. We love the hoppy craft stuff and he has a great selection. Could improve on the draft selection, though and include a Victory or Yards. I get the anchovy bar pie almost burnt, and it is awesome! A favorite spot for a casual business lunch which is not crowded."
8482,44,4,1,7/1/2013,"Ok, now I absolutely love Jojo's food and martinis (the best I have had), when I can actually get in the door. The last time I was there, I had made a reservation for 7:15 and arrived exactly on time. When I checked in, the hostess told me that wait was at least 20 minutes. I was really annoyed; we were seeing a movie at 8:50. We left, very dissapointed. What is the point in taking reservations? Jojo's is a landmark for a good reason, but they get 4 instead of 5 stars because of the wait time."
10707,44,4,1,6/4/2013,"Their mustard pie (pizza) is d@mn good and they're mostly known for their bar pies. Ive had a couple of random offerings from their menu, all satisfying. This place is PACKED -- every time I've been in it. There is a seating area -- it's a bit cramped -- sit at the bar."
10708,44,4,1,6/3/2013,I come to Jo Jo's specifically for their Mustard Pie. I am not even that big of a mustard fan but there is something magical that happens when mustard is put on pizza crust topped with cheese. It gets very busy on Fridays and weekends. Parking can be a hassle but worth the little trouble.
10709,44,2,1,3/12/2013,"My husband always wants to go here because he loves the food, but my two kids and I refuse to accompany him because we've never been able to walk in and get a table. ˜And the few times that we have eaten here, you're so cramped that it's thoroughly unenjoyable. ˜I agree that their food is good, but not so great that I will sit in this hideous environment, packed in so tight with the other patrons that you feel like you're intruding on their meals when you're walking to and from your table. ˜Oh, and when you do have to wait, there is no place to do so. ˜You feel like a big goob standing next to people who are dining. ˜Uninviting, to say the least. ˜There do seem to be a lot of regulars at the bar who are quite comfortable in this environment, but I will leave it to them."
10710,44,4,1,12/8/2012,"Trenton resident all my life, so I know my pizza (what IS it about this place, why do we have the best pizza in the universe???) ˜Jo-Jo's has got to be near the top. ˜Perhaps that place down the road that starts with D (that many people seem to worship like the D stands for Deity) is a little bit better, but you can't get brewskis there, you can't get other kinds of food there, and you can't get near the place half the time. ˜So among pizza joints around here I have to say JJ's rules. ˜Helpful hint - you won't get near this place on summer evenings unless you come before happy hour, as it is the Softball Bar of the Universe. ˜And it is also loud."
10711,44,5,1,10/22/2012,Best place in town and family-owned. Love that!
10712,44,5,1,10/8/2012,Sometimes its a little crazy in here but the food is always good.
10713,44,4,1,9/26/2012,"Food is great. ˜Can get a bit loud and takes awhile for food to come! ˜However, the bar pies are fantastic! ˜We will be back"
10714,44,3,1,9/6/2012,"Last night, I don't know what I was thinking. Okay, nice local place, near the gym, had been once before just had a glass of wine. So, in my mind I was going to meet some friends for cocktails and maybe a bite...Wowie! Forget conversation at any human decibel level! This place was full and LOUD! My fault for not knowing the lay of the land, especially on a football night....yeeech! The bar food prices are so cheap, but not great. Hey what do you want for a $3.50 pizza and .20 mini tacos? I would go back to try other items but NEVER on a football/baseball/basketball/hockey night. Okay, so maybe I'll never be back."
10715,44,4,1,8/20/2012,"I've been here on several occasions for lunch and they have yet to fail me. They have great bar pies and sandwiches. I especially love their sausage bar pie. Just thinking about it now makes me drool. I've also had their portabella sandwich before which was pretty juicy. No complaints there. They've got TV and a bar so if you're looking for good pizza, beer and sports, this is a place to hit up."
10716,44,1,1,7/10/2012,"The service in this place is just awful. We came in, the customers gave us looks like we weren't supposed to be there. The girl who gave us our menus didn't even tell us her name and walked away. Then a while later our waitress came over, an older lady, and had an attitude the entire time we were ordering. We asked to be on seperate checks and got even more attitude and awful faces from this lady. The draft beer tasted pretty terrible so I returned it and she basically grabbed it from me. It's also advertised to have the best bar pie. It left a lot to be desired. All around bad experience and I will not be returning."
10717,44,3,1,6/8/2012,"Only been here a few times over the years, and for drinks. My cousin is a server here and she and her friends make the trip over worth it. Good drinks. Will go again when in the area."
10718,44,4,1,4/21/2012,"Very good pizza, but probably not the best for families on a Friday night. I went here with my wife and 3 year old son and, having not been there before, I was a bit surprised that we had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated. ˜My bad - I should have done my homework. Also, it is very loud and is really a ""bar scene"". ˜ All that being said, the pizza is excellent. ˜Great cheese and sauce, with a good cheese to sauce ratio. ˜ We would definitely go again, but probably not on a Friday night. One last thing, if anyone is reading these reviews and is puzzled by the references to the phrase ""bar pie"", it just means a personal SIZE pizza (they have large, small, and bar sizes); it does not speak to a particular TYPE of pizza. ˜I have no idea why people insist on saying great ""bar pies""; ˜that is like saying ""great large pies"". ˜No one would ever say that, so I have no clue why people feel the need to specify that a particular size of the pizza is great. ˜Calling them ""bar pies"" seems to suggest that it is some sort of different variety of pizza, but it just connotes quantity, not quality, so don't be misled by this silliness. ˜ Now that my rant on that matter is done, I'm going to sleep. Long story short, give it a shot, the pizza is definitely very good."
10719,44,5,1,2/7/2012,One of my favorite places around. Bar pies for something like $3.50 during happy hour?? Forget about it.
10720,44,3,1,1/30/2012,"Busy place! I made a res on a Sat night and our table was ready before we were half done with our drinks at the bar. Ordered wings and roasted clams, both were excellent. Dinner I had the chicken and artichoke pasta, asked for rigatoni, came out with bow-ties as indicated on the menu. Disappointed, but they took care of it. Pizza was good thin crust, and our friends loved the Delmonico steak sandwich. Dinner salad with chicken had lots of chicken, and was good as well. I will return and try some other items hopefully again with friends, as this place seemed to be a friendly place....our waitress was great. Parking is tough. Tables are tight. Just be prepared for that."
10721,44,3,1,1/28/2012,"I like the jojos of old when i lived in the square in the 70s and 80s, they kept it simple cold beer and good bar pies at a good price. it used to get crowded but not sardine can crowded like this new concept. the bathroom is still phonebooth small and good luck with parking. my kids had to fight thru a bar crowd to use the bathroom so im not sure its meant to be a family place. the prices also went up on our recent visit. good place for guys to watch the game."
10722,44,5,1,1/21/2012,Great pizzas. Good service. Fantastic option to be to watch a game or just to enjoy a casual evening.
10723,44,3,1,1/16/2012,"i went there w/my mom for lunch. I knew what I wanted, Buffalo Chicken BarPie, I didn't want shredded chkn tho, so when the waitress finally came over to take our order, she seemed nice but when i asked her how they made their buff chkn pizzas she said they use shredded chkn, I then said ""oooh that's the way I don't like it"" ˜and was happily going to get a burger before she just about cut me off ans said, ""Then don't get it"" ˜almost rudely, I was in a great mood but shocked and said, thats no problem.

My mom actually got the buffalo pizza and it too was very good with the shredded chkn and I even told the waitress that as to not notice that she was doing a horrible job and we even tipped her generously too b/c me & mom were in such a good mood. ˜But the service was lousy and we really didn't appreciate it. ˜ALSO there was an older guy at the corner of the bar staring at me but not saying anything, twice. ˜I eventually had to say, ""do I know you?"" wierd. ˜def won't eat there again, maybe take out or delivery, Im not sure."
10724,44,5,1,11/2/2011,Good food. ˜Good prices. ˜Large menu. Great service. ˜Fun atmosphere. Lots of TV's. Small parking lot.
10725,44,4,1,10/23/2011,Busy atmosphere. Lots of fun. ˜Football on the many tv's. ˜We ordered the famous bar pie.. It was a little well done but good. Friendly service and very attentive. Reasonable prices. We'll be back!!
10726,44,5,1,9/21/2011,"Jo-Jo's Tavern has been one of my favorite spots for many years. Whether your grabbing a tomato pie with the kids or a martini with the girls you can pretty much count on it be consistent and good. Mostly well know for the tomato pies, however, Jo-Jo's offers a full menu of sandwiches and entrees. Our favorites are the Buffalo Wings and tomato pie with clams and garlic (red of course) - a little well done. The atmosphere is a little loud and lively on weekends so be prepared to wait for a table but they will accept a reservation if you call in advance. You won't be disappointed!"
10727,44,4,1,8/22/2011,"Always amazing food ˜""great bar pies"" and very well poured drinks and always fun! Must give Mike a hard time!"
10728,44,3,1,7/26/2011,"This was a bit of a toss-up for me. While the food is very good, it lacks in other areas. ˜I have yet to try the wings, but I have heard they are fantastic...and you don't hear many people rave about wings. ˜I don't like the setup of this place. Basically it is like one open room. The bar and seated tables have no seperation between them. ˜The bar is a decent size, but if you have to stand you always feel like you are in the way. ˜It's just a very impractical layout for a place that can get pretty busy. Between bar patrons, and waitresses going back and forth...it can be a pain. ˜They also have put in quite a few TV's, so I guess they want to be more of a sports destination. However, when I asked that they put one TV that was off to the side to an NBA game...the bartender didn't appear to like it. He told me that ""they dont watch that s*** here"". ˜Got the feeling he was only half joking. ˜Now no one was watching this TV anyway...but I think it had more to do with the sport than the request. ˜Note to bar...if you want to be more of a sports bar, you can't pick and choose which sports you're going to show. You may not like the NBA or the ""crowd"" you think watches it, but a lot of people enjoy these games. Also, this is a huge cop hangout...so if that is not your cup of tea, better to avoid. Also, very much an older crowd in there."
10729,44,4,1,7/21/2011,great bar food. ˜always love their bar pies. ˜Nice place to go and have some drinks and eat.
10730,44,5,1,6/28/2011,Been coming here for over 30 years and it never disappoints! Best bar pies ever!
10731,44,3,1,6/7/2011,"Good bar pies, but a bar scene that is an age bracket above mine!"
10732,44,3,1,4/17/2011,"Well, the get five stars for their extra cheese pizza and their veggie pizza. I am addicted! They make a thin crispy crust like none other. I also like the Jo Jo's salad. I have eaten there many times and always order the same thing, so I cannot comment on the rest of their menu. They get 1 star for parking - it is such a huge problem to find a spot, I have been here several times when I have had to leave or park illegally at another business and walk over to Jo Jo's. Also, they charge extra for take out!?!?! So one star for that. And the last time that we ate there, I had made a reservation for 15 people. When we arrived, and many of us were travelling from out of state from as far away as VA and GA, they did not have our reservation. In fact, the hostess said they never would have taken a reservation for 15 people on a Friday night. They finally managed to cram us at two tables that were not next to one another after I begged and insisted that they seat us. There were two tables open right next to one another but one of the tables was reserved for one of their regulars and they would not move them, as another reviewer pointed out. And I do mean they crammed us at the table! There were 9 adults around a table for 6. And we were backed up against other diners and bar patrons. One humongous guy was standing so close to my cousin that she could smell his body odor. He also whacked her in the head as he walked by. All in all, I do not know if I will be back to Jo Jo's. There are many great pizza joints in the area... Papa's Tomato Pies and Corleone's Brooklyn Pie are both really good thin crust pizzas."
10733,44,5,1,4/4/2011,"Absolutely the best. Great food. Great staff. ˜Favorite item is well done sausage bar pie, or the incredible Delmonico Steak Sandwich. ˜ Never have had a bad meal here. ˜Highly recommend."
10734,44,1,1,12/26/2010,"The bar is the only reason to go there except for the fact that the guy bartender there is a complete a hole. ˜He actually made a comment in ear shot that he hates Irish people. ˜Really? ˜In this day, biased people have no business being in business. ˜Drink enough and anything would taste good here. ˜Over priced bad pizza is the main export here."
10327,44,4,1,3/7/2010,"I've been going to Jo Jo's for quite a long time. ˜I've seen this place change esthetics so dramatically over the years yet the vibe and the staff stay the same and the food just keeps getting better. Jo Jo's Tavern is a sports bar and Hamilton landmark. ˜They're loaded up with more TVs than you can bear to watch. ˜With Hamilton residents privileged to have both Philadelphia and New York stations, Jo Jo's has to accommodate all sports fans. ˜I don't think it gets all that rowdy though - sometimes loud, but it's a friendly lot. The rumors are very true that they squeeze too many people in to this place and parking is a disaster. ˜I suppose that really tells you how much people enjoy going here. ˜With tons of big chain restaurants opening in the area, everyone still goes back to the place their parents and grandparents went to for a good night out. You can't go wrong with the pizza here but my favorite is the Delmonico cheesesteak. ˜Best steak sandwich ever in my opinion. ˜Food portions are bountiful - steaks, chops, pasta, pizza are all top notch. ˜The tap is typically stocked with your standard macro brew low calorie beer (if that's your thing) but lately they've been doing a great job at slowly introducing the crowd to better craft and import beers. I love this place and always make a point to stop in to say hi when I'm back in town. ˜Going back to Jo Jo's is like seeing an old friend from high school - the kind you really really want to see again."
10735,44,5,1,1/19/2010,"Great local place for a wide range of foods. Burgers, wings, and pizza all the way to chicken parm and vodka rig and more. Great service and a very clean. Gotta stop in and check it out."
10736,44,3,1,10/29/2009,"I would easily give JoJo's 4 stars if weren't for their awfully small parking lot and the very noisy crowd that overwhelms many first-timers. I went there for the first time in about six months and I completely forgot how loud it is inside, regardless of how crowded it is. I will say this, I do enjoy the food. The sandwiches and specials are reasonably priced and the service is usually quite good. I have yet to get something there that I didn't like. The bar pies are quite good also. The portions are large, worthy of two meals. For penny-pinchers, that's a huge plus! Don't go to JoJo's during a sports game. You won't be able to find a parking sport for one thing and there's no chance at getting a table. This place is not very egalitarian so expect to be ignored if you don't know the owner or any of the waitresses."
10737,44,4,1,6/27/2008,"Fiance's mom: ""I'm gonna take you to a bar our family has been going to forever. They've got really good Italian food. It's called Jo Jo's."" Me: ""I didn't know they have a Joe Jost out here. Cool. I've never eaten there but I've heard they have good sammiches."" Fiance's mom: ""It's Jo Jo's."" Me: ""Yes, Joe Jost. We have one in Long Beach. Never been but am amped to try it."" Fiance's mom: ""Sure, whatever."" ....later when we arrive at restaurant.... Me: (seeing the sign clearly marked Jo Jo's) ""Ok, you must have thought I was retarded. I really did think you were saying Joe Jost."" I enjoyed the food here. I had one of the daily specials--shrimp/cheese stuffed tortellini with creamy tomato white sauce. It was ˜Fing delicious. I felt compelled to lick the plate...but didn't cuz I'm a lady (sort of). Drinks were strong & the people watching was awesome. This place is crazy small so call ahead to get a table."
10738,44,4,1,3/1/2008,"Jo Jo's Tavern is pretty much the ONLY place in the area that serves food until midnight. ˜Around these parts, that's a big deal. ˜And for that, they get four stars. The bar pies are good, better than a lot of other pizza parlors, but do not come anywhere near the quality of DeLorenzo's or Papa's. ˜The wings are just ok. ˜I haven't had their other food in several years, but I remember it being consistently good. The waitresses are always friendly and accommodating, especially because we usually go in with a big group and keep them running. ˜And now that smoking is banned in NJ public places, it's much more enjoyable. The crowd is definitely a mix - from young to old and everything in between. ˜If you're in the area late night and need a bite to eat, I definitely recommend stopping here, though parking can be tough."
10739,44,3,1,6/11/2007,"Well, I'll add my review to that of my son and nephew. No one can claim that Jo-Jo's is not a friendly and popular spot in the nightlife of Hamilton. The biggest turn off is the fact that the place is always trying to put 100 people into a 75 person box. I too, have made many a Tuesday pilgrimage to Jo-Jo's to partake in antipasto (which is really pretty good), along with some kind of sandwich or bar pie. The bar pies are good, but not great and the Jersey shore burger is worth trying - after all, it has pork roll as an ingredient - always a good start. I find the portions to be adequate and the prices to be a little high. Even so, it is a great place to hang out for awhile and watch the game, or games on any one of the many flat screen TVs on hand. A good ""local bar"" for Mercerville, a part of Hamilton."
10740,44,2,1,6/11/2007,"Like my esteemed cousin below (Michael B.), I may be disowned from my extended family for writing this, but I don't really think that Jo-Jo's is all that worthwhile. ˜But I'll get to why in a minute. The Pros: ˜The bar has a lot of seating, and the folks there are pretty friendly. ˜A lot of regulars (my family included) go there, usually on Tuesday's, and I think if you showed up often enough, you'd make some new friends there. ˜Also, he food is not bad (but nothing great either). The Cons: ˜Well, the beer is what you would expect from a bar like this in a city like Trenton. ˜Me, I like a better beer. ˜The food is also, in my opinion, vastly overpriced for what you get. ˜I don't think it is worth it. Still, if you go in on a Tuesday, ask around - someone may know me."
10741,44,4,1,3/9/2007,"For some reason, I've been enjoying Jo-Jo's a lot recently. ˜It wasn't too long ago (at least it doesn't seem that long ago) that they remodeled the interior and added flat panel tv's all around along with the large projection tv at the bar and the older regular small tube tv's. ˜There's also a karaoke night and other live entertainment. Jo-Jo's is an institution in the area and I think that the son or a son has basically been running day-to-day ops for a while now. ˜Jo-Jo's is your basic friendly neighborhood bar/restaurant and yes, it's seems like it's just about always packed. ˜Even more so at night. ˜I think the only time that I've stopped by and it wasn't packed was for a Saturday afternoon lunch in the summer. Yes, it's too small inside for the amount of people who actually want in. ˜The tables are probably too close to each other and wherever you stand, you're in the way. ˜If you get there at the wrong time, you won't get a table. ˜On top of that, their parking lot is too small. ˜Yet it's still one of the more popular places in the area. ˜It's family friendly and a place where people like to hang out with their friends while having a decent to pretty good meal without breaking the bank. ˜The waitresses can be pretty cool too and there's a decent beer selection (at least the ones that I like). Speaking of food, I have to admit that I've never tried one of their entree's or dinner specials. ˜It's basically been pizza, beer and chicken parm sandwiches for me along with the usual fried appetizers. ˜The one outstanding thing that I did have recently was the Manhattan Clam Chowder. If you've never been to Jo-Jo's, don't let the crowd stop you from stopping by at least a few times. ˜It might take some time to grow on you. ˜I think you can call ahead to make a reservation."
10742,44,2,1,3/1/2006,"I may be committing a mortal sin here, but I'm going to go against the grain here on this review. Jo-Jo's Tavern is a Mercerville landmark. ˜It is always (and I mean ALWAYS) packed with people. ˜ A small place, with a decent-sized bar and about 18 - 20 tables, the establishment has a difficult time finding space for all of their patrons. ˜As a result, customers are usually squeezed up against one another in an effort to accomodate everyone. ˜It is loud and smokey all the time. ""Well, what about the food?"" you may be asking. ˜Well, most folks I know swear by the pizza. ˜I dunno. ˜For me...I have to be in the mood for it. ˜It's a standard ""bar pie"" and I think the sauce tastes a little too sweet. ˜They offer a decent antipasto salad and their vodka rigatoni appetizer is pretty good (and large). ˜ They also offer a ""Jersey Shore Burger"" (the name could be wrong) which is absolutely delicious. ˜It features a half-pound burger and several slabs of pork roll on a bun with onions and mustard. ˜It's quite yummy. The staff is friendly, but sometimes the service is slow -- most likely due to the large volumes of customers. I have been going there now for the past 20 years or so -- mainly because my family really enjoys it. ˜In fact, I still meet my parents there every Tuesday night...but I'm not quite certain why I keep going back. ˜I mean, based solely on the food, I would give this place a *** or **** review, but the atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. ˜If the place ever expands (which it should), and it becomes less crowded, I will surely enjoy it more. But, if you're from the area and you've never been to Jo-Jo's, give it a shot -- the food is pretty good, the prices are reasonable and, who knows, you may get there on an off-night when it's not too crowded :) Here's a link to their website: jojostavern.com"
10743,46,1,0,7/29/2013,"Very terrible management experience. Dined at Bugambilias during a week night. Staff was friendly, food was good. Paid with credit and also left a tip on credit. Looked at my bank statement a few days after to see that the transaction was posted. To my dismay, the amount had been increased from $86 to $96... meaning the staff increased my tip while closing out the ticket. Whether it was a mistake or not, I called the restaurant to speak with a manager about the issue. From the beginning, of course I was annoyed at the matter but was willing to split the difference and still leave my original tip, just as long as it reflected the correct amount. After speaking with a defensive manager who, rather than assuring me things will be taken care of and apologizing for the issue, said, ""your hand writing must have not been legible"" ....not exactly what a frustrated customer wants to hear after the inconvenience caused. At the end of the conversation she said she was correcting the amount as we spoke. Seven days later and my account still shows no change. I have since taken this up with other management and plan to receive my full tip back from this establishment. If anyone knows customer service, it's that the customer is always right. In this case, a decent manager could have easily changed my experience by, say, offering a discount to the meal that was overcharged, or at the very least correcting the mistake that was called out. I will never go back to this restaurant, nor recommend to any friends in the area. Very poor way of handling the situation."
10744,46,2,0,6/23/2011,"The food has been very good in the past but the last time we were there it was disappointing. ˜Worse than that, they demanded a $25 deposit for a reservation. ˜I hesitated but figured it was because they were small. ˜But after we ate they charged my card for $25 plus the meal. ˜When I called to get the charge reversed they said they would but 2 days later, still no offsetting charge. ˜I disputed it and I'm sure I won't have to pay it but what a poor way to treat customers."
10745,46,3,0,6/28/2011,"Went here on a first date. Although a reservation was made, they seemed a bit unorganized in seating and kept asking for my date's last name when we were sitting down. ˜Great vodka margarita, very strong but didnt taste overbearing. ˜Guacamole was good, above average but nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, chicken tacos and pork enchiladas as well as a chicken appetizer. Biggest complaint of the whole night was the seating arrangement. had to move everytime a server walked by, and had we been not 2 normal sized people we would have been in trouble!"
10746,46,4,0,6/6/2014,delicioso! excelente! Recommend it:)
6084,46,4,0,4/18/2014,"I spend a lot of time on business in Southern California, Arizona & New Mexico so I feel that I become very accustomed to authentic Mexican food. ˜That being said, after dining at Las Bugambilias for the third time, I am very happy with the food at this restaurant. ˜Although, since I have been exposed to so much Mexican food, I have developed a bit of ""fire-proof"" stomach and a few of the dishes here could use a bit more kick but I think that's just me. ˜My wife thinks there is plenty of spice. One note of real praise - the Mexican hot chocolate is a must for me every time I am there!! The only reason for no 5th star is that the restaurant is indeed very small/cramped but that is really just due to location."
10747,46,4,0,3/5/2014,"A beautiful, traditional Mexican restaurant with great food and an eye-catching atmosphere. ˜They serve you a lot of food so come hungry! ˜The Enfrijoles were delicious and the enchilada dishes in general were pretty popular among our group. ˜The guacamole as a starter was great, I would definitely recommend it! ˜Good place for an upscale date night, or for appetizers and a drink with friends."
10748,46,4,0,8/24/2012,"fav spot in the city! food is sooo good! its a little small and cramped inside, so make sure you like the person youre going with!"
10749,46,4,0,6/8/2012,"Very good, traditional, Mexican food. The flavors are clean, and everything tastes fresh. The menu has a good selection, and everything I have had is properly seasoned. As others have mentioned, it is pretty small inside, so make reservations as it fills up fast. It can also be noisy in here at times. I don't mind it, but it's not the place for a quiet & romantic dinner."
10750,46,4,0,4/22/2012,Good salsa. Large portions. Good vegetarian options. Place is small so make a reservation.
10751,46,4,0,3/29/2012,"The food was excellent and I was really surprised at how extensive the menu was for the small space. ˜This was my first time and I am definitely planning on returning, to try the other items I couldn't order. ˜Pitchers of margaritas are great and I look forward to trying the specialty margaritas. ˜Service could be improved with respect to attentiveness. ˜Personality and helpfulness of the server was excellent. ˜I understand being busy - and it says a lot when you are full on a Wed. night - but noticing your table's water glasses need filling without being told would have given you FIVE stars. ˜ ˜But I am still coming back."
10752,46,4,0,3/19/2012,Great food. ˜I come here again and again.
10753,46,4,0,11/12/2011,"First time tonight (Saturday). Requested a table for 6 at 6pm. ˜Was asked to leave a deposit on my credit card because they were busy! ˜No way Jose! ˜Was actually very quiet on arrival, but soon filled up. Food was very good. ˜Worth the 4*. ˜Could be a little more generous with the tortilla chips and the actual tortilla so that I didn't have to feel like Oliver! asking for ""more"". What I didn't like was the automatic 20% tip added to the bill. ˜ Seems that this restaurant is all about making $$$ (or guaranteeing the last $$$ from you), but luckily for them the food is good enough to come back."
10754,46,4,0,8/17/2011,"Great food, service, portions, & prices. Complimentary Chips and salsa/pico de gallo were good. Appetizer: shrimp caviche. All the ingredients seemed fresh, and it was packed w/ shrimp. Dinner: The lady got the enchiladas w/ the green salsa. She loved it and couldn't finish half of it. I got the chicken lava bowl. Excellent and just looked really cool. Again left with plenty of leftovers. Drinks: The x rated margarita seemed appealing,but it was happy hour and couldn't pass on the $5 house lime. Good enough for the cost. Coronas were only $3 as well. No room for dessert. For one appetizer, two entrees, a margarita, two beers, tomorrows lunch and decent tip, it only set me back $70. Minus one star because the size of the place was on the fine line between demure and just plain tight. I would go back anytime."
10755,46,4,0,8/10/2011,This place is very good. I've been here a few times and the food is delicious. I have yet to find a better Mexican place than Las Bugambilias. I love Mexican food....so I'm still searching for others to explore too. Maybe yelp can help me out.
10756,46,4,0,2/25/2011,"I've been here twice and each time I had a good experience. ˜The service was nice, the food was good and the price reasonable."
10757,46,4,0,4/12/2010,What a cute place.. eaten here two times. We decided to try it while walking on South Street. First time was good and the guacamole was amazing. Next time they gave us old guacamole. The rest - tacos - shrimp ceviche was really good though.
10758,46,4,0,1/26/2010,"I went to Las Bugambilias on Sunday Jan. 24th, The restaurant was wonderfully decorated with 1940's and 50's Mexican actors and actresses. Too cute! Besides that the services was great and the food was out of this world, but the only thing I would have to say was a bit scary was the ""costumes"" these poor girls were wearing. Black cowboy shirts with an really honking bow tie. It was really embarrassing. When are people going to learn that you don't need flashy uniforms to make your restaurant stand out."
10759,46,5,0,11/6/2013,"Definitely one of my favorite Mexican places in the city! The food is delicious and super affordable. I've only been here for dinner, but want to check it out for lunch one day. Highly recommend this place"
10760,46,5,0,2/17/2013,GREAT food! GREAT atmosphere! GREAT service! We went for Valentine's Day. ˜They had a special pre-fixe menu for 4 courses plus one cocktail. ˜We both were very impressed with the food-a perfect combination and blend of flavors and none overtook the other. ˜ Looking forward to going back with friends to see the extensive regular menu - and of course or fantastic server!
10761,46,5,0,1/25/2013,My family and I love this place. The food never disappoints. Everything we have tried is great.
10762,46,5,0,1/12/2013,"Las Bugambilias is a great place for some Mexican Cuisine. ˜It has great homemade dishes, good serivice, and it is very cozy. ˜They have lots of menu options and do great business. ˜They know how to take care of customers. ˜The food is definitely one of the best Mexican Restaurants in Philadelphia, and possibly the best in Old City. And so is the experience."

10764,46,5,0,2/1/2012,"Favorite , hands down."
10765,46,5,0,6/4/2011,"Came here on a sunny afternoon with my boyfriend. ˜Decided to start with the classic margaritas which were prepared fresh using natural ngredients (this isn't your sugary bottle mix). ˜We then decided to move to the guacamole. ˜Simple yet amazing. ˜The tortilla chips were fresh and crunchy and the fresh habanero sauce is spicy, Spicy, SPICY (aka amazing). ˜Fresh ingredients, authentic mexican food, great place for a date or gathering with friends, co-workers or family. ˜The food is a little pricey but you can get great deals from restaurant.com to help keep the bill down! ˜This place is located on south street at the end right next to PaddyWhacks (sp?). ˜Can easily walk pass and miss, but if you do, you're missing out on a great atmosphere and even better food!"
10766,46,5,0,5/19/2011,Really delicious food and great service. One of my favorite Mexican places!!
10767,46,5,0,12/31/2010,"Everything here is authentic and amazing! I would eat here every day if I lived closer. Whenever someone comes to visit me in Philly, I take them here. Everything I've eaten there is delicious, prepared with care, and brought to the table by FRIENDLY waitstaff. The waitstaff is friendly, accommodating, and patient (...having trouble deciding or waiting for the last member of your party to arrive). I could go on and on and on about how much I love this place. Check it out for yourself, you will not be disappointed."
10768,46,5,0,8/17/2010,"came her 2 times. the first was on new years. since it was a limited menu that was very dissapointing. it took a lot of convincing to come back, but the second time i had the mole and it was GREAT :). also has delicious deserts"
10769,46,5,0,5/9/2010,"Real, good Mexican food, with beautiful and homey Mexican dec›r. ˜The chef is from Veracruz, and it's reflected in the selection of fish dishes. ˜The ceviche mixto is spiced up with j­cama and mango, and served in the authentic way, with crackers. ˜We split the molcajete arrachera, but our waitress heard us debating so she brought out a ramekin of warm mol? for us to taste. ˜It was incredible--rich and complex, a little sweet. ˜I guess no two mol?s are the same. ˜If you're looking for some great Mexican food at a nice but unpretentious spot, Las Bugambilias is it. ˜I will definitely be back."
10770,46,5,0,1/3/2010,"Stopped by Las Bugambilias for a Mexican brunch yesterday with the girl and a friend. ˜As covered before, the restaurant is rather small inside and full of interesting Mexican themed decor. What I want to stress is the excellent way in which my Tree Nut allergy was handled by the hostess/server during my visit. She discussed the ingredients of both what I and my girlfriend ordered and ensured me that I would be safe. I started out with a generously poured and delicious Red Sangria, the gf with an equally strong Margarita (on the rocks, of course). We all ˜split the gaucamole, which was delicious and fresh and went well with the pico. For our entrees, I went with the Chilaquiles Verdes, the gf with the Enfrijoladas and our friend with the Torta Vegetariana. All came with a neat little salad and some fresh fruit garnish. All three of us gave Las Bugambilias a thumbs up, we left very satisfied with the drinks, food, service and price."
10771,46,5,0,11/9/2009,"It really is rare that a Mexican restaurant is able to surprise me, a Mexican American girl raised eating authentic Mex dishes. Somehow, Las Bugambilias did it! My husband took me out for a ""Sunday on South Street"". We trolled the shops and finally came to the famous Day of the Dead Maiden that stands at the front door of the restaurant. We walked into a beautifully decorated restaurant that seats about 50 people. It's definitely an intimate place but we had even more privacy since we walked in around 1:30 pm. The entire menu looked DELICIOUS so I had to carefully make my choice. I decided on the Cochinito Pibil and my husband got the Chicken Breasts marinated in Adobo. Our food was phenomenal.Both of our dishes came with rice, beans, salad + tortillas. Only mine came with plantains. Everything was perfectly seasoned, the pork was so tender that it just melts in your mouth. His chicken was so juicy yet slightly toasted on the outside. We coupled our meal with Guacamole (fresh & zesty but in a rather small toasted bowl), Ceviche Roja (shrimp in a tangy red sauce w/onions + avocado + tomato), Mex Hot Chocolate (tasted mysteriously like the ABUELITA chocolate you buy at Mex grocery stores but I don't care b/c I love it) and Agua de Orchata. The Day was capped off with a shared dessert, the Jericalla w/Grand Marnier/Caramel + fruit. It was so smooth...like cream cheese. A+ The sauces were definitely freshly made, not like the bottled crap at other places. WARNING: The brown sauce is definitely hot. I just considered it spicy but I'm used to it. I had made reservations but found that it was unecessary. I would suggest doing so for dinner time though. I can see how easily it would fill up in the evening. The service was pleasant and timely. Our waitress constantly checked on us and she always had a smile. Definitely one of the best dining experiences in Philly."
10772,46,5,1,1/6/2015,Place is a solid 10! ˜Great addition to the neighborhood a few years ago and has thrived ever since. ˜The bar is small so not much room to wait so be sure to make a reservation. ˜We have tried almost everything on the menu over the last couple years and nothing but good things to say. ˜It is a gem. ˜Also during the spring and summer they have outside seating which is good for kids...
10773,46,4,1,12/7/2014,"Went for brunch on Sunday. ˜4.5 stars. ˜Buffet was 15.00. ˜Nice variety of sweet bread, coffee, traditional dishes, and a few unique options. ˜The buffet comes in phases so try to get there at 12. ˜Entrees were wonderful. ˜Huevos con carne. ˜Steak was awesome. ˜The pechuga poblana was dynamite as well. ˜Poblano sauce remarkable. ˜Service was perfect. ˜4 stars because it wasn't off the charts - but it is authentic and prices are reasonable. ˜Bloody Mary was meh.... ˜We will be back. ˜It's better than good - close to great."
10774,46,4,1,10/27/2014,"Fancy Mexican. That sums up this joint in a nutshell. I called ahead on a Friday night at 8pm and asked if they had a table for 2 and the woman responded with 'I can seat you if you can come over right now'. For me, 'right now' was about 30 mins later and they were still able to seat us in the back. It's a small restaurant decorated in vibrant colors and had a lively atmosphere and tables are a bit crammed. We started off with two blood orange margaritas that were well worth the $11 per glass. The guacamole, while delicious, was not worth the $10 price tag. The portion was equivalent to a scoop of ice cream at your neighborhood creamery. That was probably the only complaint I had for the evening. We ordered two entrees: The skirt steak, which resembled a sample platter because it came with a chicken enchilada in mole sauce along with rice and beans. The Shrimp with cojita cheese wrapped in bacon. That description alone was mouthwatering and the dish itself was amazing. This place is a nice change from the usual Mexican fare. They offer more upscale options yet still offers fish tacos and chicken enchiladas."
10775,46,5,1,10/1/2014,"They have the best food! I had a blood orange margaritas, tortilla soup and for my entree grouper filet stuffed with crab meat. Lisa was our waitress and she was very attentive with each table."
10776,46,5,1,9/20/2014,"Very authentic hispanic style, tasty and flavorful. Prices are not bad for portions and Margaritas are awesomely good."
10777,46,5,1,9/15/2014,"Easily best kept secret on South Street for authentic Mexican food. The restaurant is very quaint and personal. Solid date spot, my girlfriend and I went there for dinner. The service is very helpful and attentive. I highly recommend trying the tacos al pastor. They also have a stellar mexican beer menu. Get a sol beer with your tacos and enjoy!"
10778,46,4,1,8/12/2014,"Was there this past Sunday, very authentic, the waitress was probably the best waitress i have ever had. Service was great! Food was excellent. Def rec."
10779,46,3,1,7/23/2014,"Went here for the boyfriend's birthday dinner on a recommendation from a friend. The layout is cozy and though we were originally put in a high traffic spot, our server moved us to a more private table by request. We got guacamole and mole sauce along with our salsa and chips to start out. The chips tasted a little stale and the guac was just average but I really enjoyed the salsa and the mole sauce was some of the best I've ever had: creamy and sweet! For entrees I got the vegetarian enchiladas and my boyfriend got enchiladas in mole sauce. I am vegetarian and he has a gluten allergy: the menu was accommodating for both dietary restrictions and our server was helpful. My vegetarian enchiladas were fine and the green sauce they came in was delicious. The enchiladas in mole sauce were to die for! We also got two margaritas that were tasty, generous, and very authentic. This spot is expensive, $46 for two of us without dessert, but a good dining experience. Great service and good food but not fantastic enough for the the price."
10780,46,4,1,7/8/2014,"The vegetarian enchiladas were delicious! A little spicy- but delicious. Also, love the pico de gallo. Definitely in a cute area of Philadelphia- pleasantly surprised."
6537,46,4,1,6/28/2014,My girlfriend said it should be 5 stars but I thought it was a 3 star....my meal was good but not unbelievable so we stuck with 4 stars. ˜The menu seemed authentic and they had a lot of options. ˜ We started with the Queso Chihuahua Toluca which was great. ˜My girlfriend had the ensalada de mango with shrimp and I had the Molcajete Pollo. ˜Both were good but I would probably get something else next time. ˜The chicken didn't seam to soak up the flavor of the sauce it was in. I would recommend stopping by if you are in the area.
10781,46,5,1,6/1/2014,"Thank you !! I work in San Francisco, it's amazing that I find superior Mexican cuisine in Philly. This is authentic Veracruz cuisine, charmingly decorated. First class food, fresh and delicious. If your ready to realize that Mexican food has little to do with burritos and nachos, step up and enjoy the breadth of our cuisine !!"
10782,46,5,1,5/28/2014,"Las bugambilias is an excellent upscale mexican restaurant. ˜The space is small but it works.They have above average margaritas and excellent guacamole. ˜Chicken quesadillas are delicious and very flavorful. The dishes we had for dinner were some of the best mexican food I have ever had. ˜I ordered the medallion oaxaca, the filet was done perfectly and exploding with flavor. ˜My gf had the mar y tierra molcajete. ˜Lava rockbowl filled with jumbo shrimp, filet tips, grilled chicken all in an excellent sauce. ˜The sauce was very flavorful and spicy but not too spicy. ˜The staff was very helpful in regards to the level of spice in each dish and was happy to order each entree per our desired level of heat. I will be coming back whenever I am craving high quality mexican food in the philly area."
10783,46,1,1,5/24/2014,"Don't go here! It's good food but it's over priced and the manager (I think that's her title?) is extremely rude and unprofessional. I had a small issue to discuss with her and she avoided my phone calls for a week. Finally she responded by TEXTING me, I guess I'm not worth her time. She said I should ""push my luck"" by calling so much. I was reasonable and I did not use any kind of offensive laguage but she didn't want to hear it and her last text to me was, ""This conversation is over."" Don't support people like this. There are so many great restaurants, I will never take anyone here again."
10784,46,3,1,4/19/2014,"Great food, but everything else was mediocre. We decided to come here for our anniversary, hoping that it would be a nice restaurant with excellent food. I made reservations three weeks ago, but we had to wait 15 min. for a table when we arrived. They sat us at the bar, but didn't offer us a drink for 10 minutes. Eventually, we were seated at a very small table. We literally had to climb over other clients to get there. It's a very, very cramped restaurant. Luckily, the acoustics are good, so it isn't overwhelmingly loud, even though it's a lot of people in a small room. SERVICE: Like I said, we had to wait for our table, even with a reservation. I had even confirmed this reservation earlier in the day. Additionally, we weren't offered drinks for a long time. I think our waitress forgot about us a few times, because we didn't get refills on our drinks until we asked for them. FOOD: I am a vegetarian, and there were plenty of options for me. I chose the Vegetarian Enchiladas. They were the best I've ever had. There was an amazing poblano cream sauce and the black beans were amazing. The chips & salsa were good (but small), but the salsa was extremely spicy. I love spicy food, but the salsa rojo was too-hot-to-handle for me. DRINK: I am a huge margarita fan and I thought this was decent, but not great. 6/10 PRICE: I thought that the food was decently priced for being such high quality with fresh ingredients. My enchiladas were $15, for example. The margarita, however, was $9. This was too expensive for the quality of the drink I received. Additionally, we didn't order the guacamole because we heard the portion size was too small for the price ($9.5)."
10785,46,4,1,3/3/2014,"You know you are in a real Mexican place when you are surrounded by real Mexican kitsch and are drinking out of those blue-rimmed glasses everyone gets from Nogales. Our meal was Valentine's night so the menu was limited, but the dishes superb. ˜We split the guac, which, in agreement with Michelle C., was over-priced and under-portioned. ˜ In contrast, my $25 crab-stuffed grouper wrapped in soft corn pastry was fantastic. ˜I modified it by substituting extra salad instead of rice, and plenty of additional delish salsa without any issue. ˜My girlfriends got a chicken dish that was way to sweet for my taste, resiny and carmelized, but hey it worked for them. Overall, it was a delightful experience for 4 girls dining out on Valentine's. ˜We could be as loud as we liked dishing gossip and clinking margaritas, because 'Ole! Estamos en Mexico.'"
6578,46,3,1,2/25/2014,"This teeny tiny traditional Mexican joint has a lot of character and makes a pretty great meal. ˜I went with a large group (14), and they handled us well. ˜The service was quick and friendly even though we took up half of the restaurant. I started with the Tamales de Puerco. ˜I would have preferred them without the sauce on top, but these were pretty good tamales. ˜They were moist and flavorful. For my meal I had the Molcajete Pollo (chicken, scallions,cactus leaves in verde sauce). ˜It had a nice spice to it, though it was a bit of a pain to eat (but maybe I'm just an idiot, I burned myself on the lava bowl more than once). ˜The hot sauce that was served with chips had good taste and heat to it, and worked well to add to meal. ˜ Any guacamole that you get, whether coming with your meal or ordering separately, will be very small but tasty. The traditional margarita that I ordered wasn't bad. ˜Nothing that I tasted different than other margaritas. ˜ I'd like to go back and work my way through the menu a bit further. ˜This is traditional Mexican food, even though there are some Americanized dishes on the menu."
10786,46,2,1,2/24/2014,"Horrendous service. Absolutely horrendous. The food has also gone downhill. I used to rave about this place. After three occasions in a row with terrible service and mediocre food, I will not return."
10787,46,5,1,2/22/2014,One of the best Mexican restaurants in Philadelphia. The food speaks to your heart. Having eaten in local hotels Mexico I can safely say the food is very close to being authentic. And the drinks are simple with a kick too. Especially the michilladas. The setting is very cozy and the service was very warm. Pesos well spent here.
10788,46,5,1,2/3/2014,Nice small restaurant. ˜Good ambiance. ˜Food was delicious! ˜Mole sauce and salsa verde were legit. ˜My only issue was the guacamole serving was a bit small. ˜I could've eaten it by my self. ˜Definitely no more than 2 people a serving.
10789,46,4,1,1/19/2014,Came here again for happy hour and the food was just as good as my first visit. Very friendly service and generous portions.
10790,46,5,1,1/15/2014,Definitely my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. The enfrijoladas are amazing and are a ˜must try for sure. It's a little small inside so making a reservation is good idea.
10791,46,4,1,1/10/2014,"Went to this place for the first time last night with a friend who lives near the restaurant and is a regular there. ˜The food was delicious and the ambiance perfect for 2 friends catching up - not too loud, but not uncomfortably quiet, either. As we are both big seafood fans and were in the mood for fish that night, we both enjoyed the Enchiladas Del Mar. ˜Really great flavors and enchilada sauce, with the right amount of rice and vegetables on the side. ˜My friend had her heart set on the Ceviche Mixto, her regular order, but unfortunately they were out of it. ˜I can't wait to return so I can try it! Margaritas were very good and the service was great. ˜Serving of chips was a bit small, but delicious."
5886,46,5,1,1/8/2014,"I accidently stumbled into this place when I couldn't find a brunch at 2:00pm. I wanted eggs and sweet meats as all people who are hungover do, but was pleasantly surprised with the amazing food. We started with the queso fundido and DEAR GOD was it good, Made with fresh shrimp forget about it! Then I had the Carne dish which had a stuffed jalpeno pepper in the middle. Yeah that happened! I think I have found my new favorite Mexican food restuarant."
10792,46,5,1,1/5/2014,"Probably my favorite Mexican place in the city!! My dinner and drinks were awesome. I don't know what they put on the enchiladas, but it's sinfully delicious."
10793,46,5,1,1/4/2014,"Great place to go for Mexican food. If you are near South street in Philly, try the place out and you'll definitely come back for more."
10794,46,5,1,12/17/2013,"Their menu is large, everything is home made and served fresh, and is delicious. We had 2 vegetarian enchilada dishes (Requeson [ricotta] & Vegetariana) and they were amazing. The service was good, there is a full bar with great cocktails. I also love the atmosphere, which is packed with art, rustic dishware, little trinkets. Highly recommend, and we've never needed a reservation!"
10795,46,5,1,12/11/2013,"Great margaritas, quaint small atmosphere, very intimate, and after 3 trips, it's now a staple - the food is authentic and delicious!"
6499,46,4,1,12/9/2013,"The guacamole was extremely good. I ordered the tequila steak, but was then asked if I wanted the cheese smothered steak instead. I made the obvious choice. The cheese covered rib-eye is extremely delicious. Try it. Drinks were good and happy hour brough the price down. Staff was very friendly. They lost one star because I felt pretty cramped at my table, although in fairness, I'm kind of tall."
6813,46,5,1,11/16/2013,"9//21/2014 I don't know where my previous rave review went... but we stopped in again two nights ago and once again - it was great. We tend to stick to the enchiladas because they are simply terrific. We had the Pablano again and the Verde. Wow. Everything is way fresh, the flavors are great, and the portions will fill you up. Special mention - the margaritas. Love 'em. Great variety, great quality. We showed up at the end of happy hour which is worth targeting. It was clear we'd have one drink and back to normal prices, so for about 38 bucks two of us ordered the pitcher. The pitcher was huge. By the end of our meal, nearly half the pitcher remained - I finished it as matter of principle and was reminded you pay twice for alcohol when things go to far. 11/16/2013 Excellent meal. We walked in without reservations on a Sat evening and we're accommodated. Ceviche traditional was OK - a tomato based sauce for two of three offerings, I prefer lime. The nachos very, very good. The enchilada pablano was extraordinary - within the top we've had. We eat here every few years and it's always great. Our frequency must increase. The margheritas were delicious. Pricy but large. Not to be missed."
10796,46,5,1,11/16/2013,"I love this place. Food wise: I have yet to try a dish I have not found to be delectable. This includes the Enfrijoladas (chicken), Enchiladas (chicken), Mango salad, and Molcajete Pollo. The chips and salsa (hot & mild) are fresh, albeit, a relatively small portion. The mango salad consists of thinly sliced mangos on a bed of greens with a vinaigrette dressing. It is very good, but could use more mangos. The main dishes are full of flavor, without being overwhelming or heavy. The black bean sauce on the Enfrijoladas is scrumptious. The Molcajete can be ordered with chicken, shrimp, and/or steak and is excellent for sharing. The house margaritas are a solid 7 out of 10. The atmosphere is warm and intimate. Again, not overwhelming, but just right. The service is attentive and friendly. I have not travelled to Mexico and, therefore, cannot speak to the authenticity of the food as some commentators have. But, I have eaten at many a Mexican restaurants and the flavors here are wonderful. I recently ate at a more upscale Mexican restaurant in Rittenhouse and, although, the prices were twice as much the flavor was 1/2 as good. This place is a gem."
6988,46,4,1,9/29/2013,"Las Bugambilias is quite good, authentic Mexican cuisine, and it is very apparent that the the dishes served are from Yucatan, Puebla and Distrito Federal (Mexico City). ˜ However, I found (and so did my husband) that the food is somewhat lacking in flavor, hence the four instead of five stars. ˜ The service is excellent, the ambiance nice and I only wish that they would offer up fresh juices such as judo de naranja (orange), jugo the zanaoria (carrot) and jugo de tomate (tomato juice for bloody marys) Parking is horrible in the area, unless you have vehicle with two wheels, then you may park in the motorcycle or scooter parking. ˜Bicycle parking is also easy in the area. ˜ The public transportation is also excellent in Philly. ˜I love it."
10797,46,4,1,9/21/2013,"Definitely a different style of Mexican cuisine than what I am used to in Texas, but great in its own right. Plenty of choices with steaks, chicken breast dishes, and seafood to please the non-fan of Mexican food. If you are in the need for a Latin fix, I would recommend it. Full bar (although small) is a plus too!!"
10798,46,3,1,8/26/2013,"Great atmosphere and a buzzing South Philly location, but to me this is middle of the road Mexican, made by Gringos for Gringos. It just lacks that south of the border authentic flair, that could take it to greater heights. The fresh made chunky guac and house made tortilla chips were the highlight of the meal; don't order here without it. To drink, the coconut mojito should be your goto cocktail, refreshing and pairing perfectly with the Mexican fare in front of you. This place is a great night out, but food wise it's clear this ain't quite Cali and for darn sure not quite Mexico. Mÿs o menos -SZ"
10799,46,5,1,8/24/2013,"This place is outstanding. I've gone there 3 times now, twice for brunch and once for a friend's birthday party. It's a small spot and we were a party of 12 and got a bit rowdy on account of all the tequila, but the staff couldn't have been nicer. The food is always great and the micheladas are completely addictive but where this place really shines is the service. They're warm, friendly and inviting and every time I leave, I can't wait to go back. I honestly could not recommend another place in this town higher than Las Bugambilias."
10800,46,5,1,8/14/2013,I stopped in Philly to see my beloved SF giants play the phillies. Ballpark was awesome and we ended up sitting next to a couple who told us to go here. Being that both my partner and I are from Cali and LOVE Mexican food we decided to give it a try. Skeptical we went the next day for lunch and sat outside. The service was good. We weren't in a rush and enjoyed watching people pass by. The salsa and chips were pretty good and we found the decor to be cute and traditional. When the food came I have to say I was blown away with my dish. I ordered the veggie enchiladas with crema poblano sauce. Mmm yum! I can't say this was the most authentic Mexican restaurant I've ever been to but I'll be back for those enchiladas for sure! So glad the locals suggested this place.
10801,46,4,1,7/21/2013,"I was on and about with my girlfriends on Saturday and we wanted to have Mexican food for dinner. My friend suggested this place and the Yelp reviews were good so we gave it a shot. We walked in at about 7:45 looking for a 9:00 reservation. The hostess informed us for a group of 5, 9:30 would work better. The place was pretty tiny, so we were happy to get a spot and figured we could kill some time on South Street. A little before 9 the skies were about to open up so we returned to wait out the rest of the time out of the rain. The table was ready within minutes of early arrival - score! First things first, we had to figure out our margarita situation. Since 4 of us were drinking we figured we'd go with the pitcher of house margarita. It was a good call. There was more than enough and it had a perfect mix of flavor and tequila. As for food, since we had been eating non stop all day everyone decided to go for a personal appetizer and a round of guac and chips. So I read the reviews and knew we would be charged for any additional chips but I was shocked when we only got 2 tiny baskets for the table. There were 5 people and we paid for the guac! How can we be excepted to divide that up? Half a chip per person? ˜The guac itself was tasty, I personally enjoy getting larger chunks of avocado when I dip and that's exactly what I got. The chips weren't that great. They seemed a little greasy and broke easily when I tried to get some guac. We also got two different cups of salsa- one was spicy and one was a thick with chunks of well seasoned tomatoes. Very enjoyable when mixed. For my ""main course""/appetizer dinner I had the sopes veracruzanos- two hand made tortillas topped with re-fried beans and queso fresco one with chicken and one with pork ˜The plate was garnished with the chunky, pico de gallo type salsa. Very enjoyable! There was definitely a little kick of spice and the flavors were blending nicely in each bite. I can't forget to mention the decor. The place was filled with various Mexican tchotchkes. It was eclectic and a pleasant atmosphere. The water glasses were slanted- sort of like a noodle- and quite the fun shape. I was impressed by the appetizer and very happy with margarita. I can't wait to come back hungry and check out the full menu. I have my eye on the enchilada section. Ole!"
10802,46,3,1,7/14/2013,"You know, honestly this place would get 4 stars if it weren't for the salsa and chips ""policy"" they have at this restaurant. Apparently, you can only get one portion of salsa and chips for free, and then everything else after that is 2 dollars for chips and 2 dollars for salsa. I'm not being a cheapskate... but seriously what restaurant charges for salsa and chips (small portions too). The salsa is pretty good, but the tortillas chips are just old tortillas from the day before... a little ridiculous in my head And what is further confusing/angering is that it actually says in the menu that ""one basket of tortilla chips is provided for each entree. So If you and your boyfriend get an entree each, does that not mean we should get at least two baskets of chips free? Apparently not. Apparently my understanding of that statement was incorrect because what that means to their restaurant is that it's one two share. So then... what happens if you have 6 people who order 6 entrees. One basket of chips for you. I don't get it. Other than the food is pretty decent. The portions are big (definitely will have leftovers) and quality is good. Fresh veggies, salad, really yummy black beans come with your main entree, and the sides are just as good as the entree. it's just too bad when a restaurant will be stingy on something as minor as chips and salsa."
10803,46,5,1,7/12/2013,"Reserved a table for 12 for a ""baby sprinkle"" for my sister in law. They were so courteous and accommodating and the food was delicious and timely for a small place and a party of that size. The fish tacos were TO DIE FOR and the guac with hot fresh tortilla chips was incredible. What a great little authentic mexican restaurant with beautiful glasses and dishes and a KILLER fresh margarita! Ole' :)"
8375,46,3,1,7/9/2013,"The most expensive pitcher of Hornitos Marggies i have ever had ( 50.00 fuggin dollars ) luckily there were 3 of us and they were really strong . I spent my afternoon with two of my favorite ladies and though service started off a little rocky i will say i will give this place a shot for dinner. I wasnt a huge fan of the portion size of the guacamole it was pretty small for the price , flavor wise it was spot on though I will say the best guacamole in the city is still at El Vez. My girls seemed to enjoy their quesadillas and tortilla soup. I was slightly put off that they didnt offer more taco options. I know pastor has the game in the bag but even small taco stands offer fish or some sort of veggie friendly option. Id go back for HH and one of those margies im not sure my wallet could take a hit for the pitcher."
10804,46,4,1,7/1/2013,Small place that we stumbled upon by accident. Absolutely great food. Lovely decor with great attention to details. Will come back next time I'm visiting Philly
10805,46,3,1,7/1/2013,"Good Mexican food at very reasonable prices. The portions are huge. My friend and I split the vegetarian enchiladas, which came with three enchiladas covered in a delicious poblano crema sauce. Highly recommended. Only issue was upon arriving at the restaurant for our 7pm Sat. reservations the hostess told us our table was needed for a 9pm reservation. Did that mean we had to rush because they overbooked? They lost money on our dinner because there was no reason to order drinks and appetizers if we had to make way for another reservation. Food is worth another visit. But perhaps a weeknight will be better so we don't have to be told we're on a time limit."
10806,46,4,1,6/18/2013,"Fresh and delicious food, authenticity really comes through. ˜Great drinks, decent service. ˜I've eaten there about five times now and have yet to have a bad meal. ˜The enchiladas are amazing, soups and salads will make your taste buds sing. ˜And the desserts are very good (esp the crema de olla)."
10807,46,5,1,6/5/2013,"Stopped back in to my favorite neighborhood Mexican restaurant! Took my BF and his friend, both of them are PICKY Foodies (not that I am judging.) ˜They enjoyed everything! ˜Upon my recommendation, our friend got the Enchiladas del Mar and the BF got Camarones al Guajillo which also had an amazing sauce! The waitress was extremely friendly and service was quick. ˜We will surely return again!"
10808,46,2,1,5/30/2013,"The food is good, however, I'm updating my first review from a couple of years ago due to the poor services I received on my most recent visit. ˜My husband and I stopped in to make a take out order this past Sunday. ˜We happened to be in the area and I was in the mood for their food and wanted to take advantage since we don't live close. ˜However, when we first came in the hostess told us to go to the bar and place our order with the bartender. ˜When we were went over to the bar, the bartender was very rude and seemed bothered by us customers-- apparently, she doesn't realize that by having customers, is how she makes money. ˜Even though the patrons at the bar had just left, she told us that she couldn't take our order and that we had to place it with the hostess. ˜The hostess returned and took our order. ˜I told her what I wanted twice. ˜She came back and asked again what I wanted a couple of minutes later and I pointed to it on the menu. ˜We left to take a walk because the restaurant was crowded and we didn't want to sit at the bar with the surly bartender. ˜We came back 20 minutes later and picked up the order. ˜When I got home, I was very upset to see that despite having repeated multiple times what I wanted and physically pointing it out on the menu, I still didn't get the right order. As we don't live close, we couldn't just turn around and take it back. ˜I emailed them to tell them about the poor service I received in hopes that they would apologize or want to make it right and encourage us to come back. ˜I got no response after a few days, hence my updated review. ˜It's said to have to update this review negatively, but the facts are the facts."
8367,46,4,1,5/20/2013,"So a pitcher of margaritas will set you back fifty bucks. However, said pitcher of margies lasts for quite some time and has enough kick to get three girls pretty tipsy. Highly recommended. Our crew also shared an order of guac, which I thought was overpriced and under-portioned at nine bucks. My tortilla soup came in just under seven dollars and was delicioso. While I thought the prices were on the spendy side, the quality of everything I tried is enough to get me back for dinner sometime. And you know I'm going to be hitting up those happy hour margs in the very near future."
10809,46,1,1,5/8/2013,"Our food was horrible... Qdoba taste better than this. I enjoy Qdoba, but we all know it's not authentic."
10810,46,5,1,5/1/2013,"This is my favorite mexican restaurant in the city (maybe even just my favorite restaurant period). ˜The bf gets a steak wrapped around a pepper while I always get the mole enchiladas. ˜I swear, their mole sauce is like nothing else in this world. ˜Other places try but can't match this place -- they have the perfect balance of chocolate and spices. ˜The plates are pretty huge -- the enchiladas include 3 enchiladas, a salad, beans, and rice. ˜Each table also gets complimentary chips and salsa, both of which taste freshly made. ˜Together this is enough for 2 meals! Yes, the space is tight, but I think that's what adds more charm to this place. ˜Never had bad service either. ˜The margs are expensive but strong and tasty!"
10811,46,4,1,4/25/2013,"This is a neighborhood gem! I love Mexican food so when my friend who live just one block away mentioned the restaurant I already had a feeling I would like it - and I did. The friendly service, authentic Mexican d?cor and cozy atmosphere alone deserves a full 5 stars! However, I was reviewing the overall experience and because I wasn't completely satisfied with my main dish I gave it 4 stars. I will be back for sure! It is a small restaurant but on a weeknight we had no problem getting a table for two. And we were there just in time to enjoy a happy hour drink special which ends at 7pm. $5 house made sangria or margaritas. I had a white sangria and my friend ordered a red sangria for the happy hour special. The white sangria was good - not too sweet but just the right blend of fruity flavors. We ordered guacamole as an appetizer to go along with the complimentary chips and salsa. ˜There are two salsas - mild and spicy. The mild one is a traditional pico de galla and the second one as our waitress called 'spicy' was really HOT! ˜I love spicy food so without hesitation I put a small spoonful of it on a chip and bit in but wow to my surprise my eyes started tearing because the spice was so powerful. It turns out there are habanero peppers in it and that is why it's so spicy. In smaller does it's really good but just beware! For my entr?e I ordered the Enchiladas Del Mar which were stuffed with shrimp, crab and lobster meat served with rice and saut?ed zucchini. The enchiladas were smothered in a chipotle sauce and lots of cheese. I was surprised there was so much cheese but that added a lot of flavor to the dish. The sauce was really flavorful too. However, I was disappointed that there was not a very good portion of seafood in the enchiladas. There were a few baby shrimp in each, a forkful of crab meat and I didn't see any lobster but it may have been mixed in well. ˜ My friend ordered Mole Chicken Enchiladas and they were really good! Lots of chicken filled the rolled up tortillas and it was covered in a rich mole sauce. She loved her dish and I think I will order that next time."
10812,46,4,1,4/23/2013,"Visiting Philly and hungry so jumped on Yelp and Las Bugambilias popped up in our area. ˜Always in the mood for Mexican food, so why not try it. ˜Thank you Yelp! ˜ Good food and atmosphere. ˜It's quite small inside. ˜If weather is nice, I would suggest sitting outside. ˜Overall a very good experience."
10813,46,3,1,4/10/2013,"This is a very cute, cozy restaurant. Service was attentive and pleasant. That being said, the food was so so. My bf and I shared the tacos al pastor, and they were tiny! Barely any meat on it. I can't even remember what else we had, so it wasn't very memorable. Not worth the high prices,"
10814,46,3,1,4/9/2013,"Just ok. Menu is extensive with a lot of tasty options, but didn't think it was worth the price. Liked the enchiladas, thought the margs were just ok."
10815,46,5,1,4/3/2013,"It was the first ˜time we eat here, it was amazing! As authentic as can be for a Mexican Place on South Street. ˜The food was fresh and the service was exceptional, this ain't no South of the Border. ˜We will be back."
10180,46,4,1,4/3/2013,"Enfrijoladas with very fresh, avocado: yum! Plus an amazing pickled salad and black beans and friendly service."
10816,46,5,1,3/27/2013,"Went to dinner for the first time here last night and it was AWESOME! I highly recommend the Enchiladas del Mar! ˜They were fantastic! ˜Also, the portions were very generous. ˜I had dinner last night and lunch for today :)And the guacamole for an appetizer was a great starter. ˜I definitely will be back again soon! ˜And the service was just as good as the food :)"
10817,46,2,1,3/1/2013,"I went out of my way to come here and eat when I visited Philly based on great memories I had from first trying the restaurant circa 5 years ago. ˜At the time, I thought it was outstanding. ˜I also visited last year for happy hour and thought they had decent margaritas. ˜This time though I must say I prefer the food at Chipotle and could not comprehend why they would ruin a drink by adding sour mix to my drink which was clearly listed on the menu as mezcal, St. Germain and lime. ˜Definitely would not go back!"
10818,46,5,1,2/25/2013,Food and atmosphere are excellent
10819,46,5,1,2/24/2013,Great neighborhood gem! Everything on the menu is yummy and having authentic mexican local is awesome. ˜The fish is all fresh and the the guacamole is delicious. ˜There is not a plethora of seating space so certainly make a reservation in advance. ˜Enjoy!
10820,46,5,1,2/22/2013,Best Mexican restaurant ˜in philadelphia. Love the waitstaff. Food is the best in the city. Only place to eat Mexican. Go there but make reservations. You will not be disappointed.
10821,46,4,1,1/7/2013,"We love Las Bugambilias. Being from Phoenix, I am always looking for a fantastic, authentic Mexican place that we can frequent, thankfully we've found one. Their salsa and guacamole are delicious and made fresh and you can have it made more spicy if you prefer - which we do. I always enjoy the fish tacos and my partner, the chicken mole...and of course a pitcher of margaritas. My only con is the table size - small. Actually the whole restaurant is which isn't so bad just be careful how you order. We'll stagger when we place our orders just so that the table doesn't become uncomfortable. We apply this same idea if there w/ another couple. It can be like playing Tetris so everything fits!"
10822,46,4,1,12/29/2012,"The food and the service was great, I will be going back! ˜(4 stars from a woman that is Mexican. ..lol)"
10823,46,3,1,12/21/2012,"The staff were super nice, the food was really good, but overall, not the most memorable meal. ˜I do remember that my cocktail was good and the desserts were really good! ˜I would recommend it, but I can't remember what I had."
10824,46,5,1,12/17/2012,"With so many options in Philly for food, the husband and I try not to go back to places too often so we can try someplace new... however, since we discvered Las Bugambilas several months back, we've made our return two additional times. It's a tiny place with limited seating- be prepared to sit up close and personal to the table next to you. The food is amazing... when you sit down, they bring out homemade chips and salsa. The chips are the perfect crispiness and size to accomodate the pico de gallo and spicy salsa. We've gone with groups and have gotten to try a variety of the appetizers and entrees. The nachos are different...in a very good way. Not your typical chips, cheese, sour cream... its thicker..heartier... kind of amazing. The chorizo queso dip is incredible- do not miss it!! As for the entrees, I have sampled the Mole Chicken Echiladas... and the mole sauce is amazing... the perfect amount of smokyness to balance the slight amount of heat it has to it. It comes with three enchiladas with a side of rice, beans, and guacamole. Most recently I ordered the Fish Tacos... which was such a large portion. The fish was perfectly fried - still delicate inside, but crisp on the outside- and the amount of fish per taco was actually almost too much, that i felt the need to eat several pieces with my fork prior to wrapping up each taco. As for the pitchers of Margarita, beware... they can serve a small army. We ordered 2 pitchers for our party of 6... and left the restaurant with some leftover after consuming it for over an hour. When the waitress says it could serve 6 people, she actually means it can serve 6 people...not 6 glasses worth."
10825,46,3,1,11/29/2012,"One of my favorites in Philly for a few years but having gone back last week I was so disappointed with the drinks. They used to be fresh and delicious and now they are awful. Ordered a blood orange margarita and it was very artificial and almost had a chemical taste. The carne tampiquena is no longer on the menu but they will still make it, though not as well. Will still go for food but I like a margarita with my Mexican food!!"
10826,46,4,1,11/24/2012,"Woot woot. Yes, go eat here. Ay dios mio. We like Mexican. We like it a lot. And, we eat a lot of it. Normally, when in Philly, we go to Tequila. That place is good, for sure. But, last night we went to this small place on a recommendation. A great meal ensued. We sat at a comfy table by the window and ordered a bunch of food. The service was good, the margaritas were reasonable (at a great price), and the food was great. I'll definitely go back the next time I'm in Philly and in need of some Mexican food. I recommend, in particular, the vegetable enchiladas (with salsa verde). The enchiladas del mar were apparently good, too, though i didn't have any. (My wife attests that it was good.)"
10827,46,4,1,11/18/2012,"Very authentic, great flavor, excellent service, great atomosphere. Chips and salsa was great. (Warm chips with home made salsa) shrimp ceviche was ˜excellent. Had stuffed chicken and tilapia for main dish. These were also flavorful and delicious."
10828,46,5,1,11/14/2012,This place is really adorable. The restaurant is very small and narrow. Even for the waitress to walk in the aisle to serve the food seemed a challenge. As you can imagine its a very tight fit. The menu had a ton of wonderful options to choose from. I was pleased to see even vegetarian options. My husband and I enjoyed our meals.
10829,46,2,1,11/13/2012,"This place has great potential and definitely has wonderful food. ˜Where it falls short is in regard to the ambiance and very real smallness of the place. ˜It is tough to be comfortable in the hard cushioned chairs and low tables, and though this may seem trivial, imagine enjoying a meal and trying to sit comfortably, while needing to move your chair in as far as it can go any time someone needs to squeeze by your table."
10830,46,3,1,11/9/2012,"This was a spur of the moment decision. ˜One of us wanted Mexican food, a quick yelp search and we were on our way. It was both our first times there, though we questioned why given that it received such high marks. ˜We had a hard time deciding but finally settled on guacamole, empanadas for appetizers. ˜For the entrees, I had the Chalupa Veracruz. ˜It was very clean and light, just enough flavor. ˜It didn't blow my mind though. ˜It seems like one of those dishes that many restaurant has, whether it's Italian or Mexican or Asian. ˜Your basic seafood in a tomato based broth. ˜But again, it was good. ˜My friend had the Chile Rellenos. ˜Now that was a little more impressionable. ˜Nice messy blend of flavors that all go well into the provided tortilla wraps. ˜For dessert, we had the Tres Leches Chocolate cake. ˜Although our dessert options were limited due to many being sold out (I think that's a good thing right?), this cake did not disappoint. ˜ The service was very friendly too. ˜The only thing is that I thought the prices were a smidgen high. ˜Just a smidgen though."
10831,46,5,1,11/8/2012,"Was here 4 yrs ago and had a fantastic meal. Not sure why it took us so long to get back, but finally did tonight - and it was just as good. Definitely will have to get back sooner than 4 yrs. There were 3 of us and everything was exceptional."
10832,46,4,1,11/5/2012,"Very good. ˜Went on a slow night (hurricane predicted). ˜Food was really tasty! ˜Got guacamole; came with homemade chips, a simple & tasty tomato salsa and a nice hot sauce. ˜Service took mere minutes. ˜Entre was a chicken enchilada with salsa verde; it came with a small salad on the plate, along with a helping of rice and of beans. ˜The entre was not brought out until after I finished the starter. ˜The food was straight-from-the-kitchen hot and very flavorful! ˜Also enjoyed two margaritas, which were great. ˜Saw several locals getting takeout. ˜Made reservations online, just in case, and they fully knew about them when I got there. ˜Very nice way to spend my birthday!"
10833,46,2,1,10/15/2012,"This place was authentic, but that does not mean it was good. The atmosphere was bright, loud and claustrophobic. ˜Tables were much to close, not only left to right but front to back. ˜Just walking through the place was an uncomfortable experience. The drink menu was overwhelmed with Margaritas made with vodka. ˜That seemed an odd choice for authentic Mexican. ˜We each ordered one, they arrived at our table about 25 minutes later (after I asked the waitress about them). ˜They were not in my opinion good. We ordered guacamole which came in a tortilla shell that was stale, the accompanying chips were also stale. ˜The guacamole itself was uninspired but passable. Dinner arrived and it followed the quality of the rest of the meal. ˜The meet in my dish was rubbery and tasteless, the sauce was very good, but the flavor did not translate to the rest of the dish. ˜the place was so cramped and the tables so small it was hard to eat. I have been told this is a good lunch place, I think they need to learn the difference of expectations between lunch and diner."
8337,46,4,1,9/22/2012,"We went here for dinner last night and had a really enjoyable meal. I called in the afternoon to make reservations for 4. We arrived to find that they had only recorded us for 2, but they moved things around to accommodate our 4 people. We ordered guac and drinks. We received the guac (and complimentary salsas) promptly. Our drinks took at least 30 minutes to come. We asked time and time again, we watched other tables get drinks, but ours were no where to be seen. We also asked repeatedly for water to no avail. In her defense, our waitress was working her TAIL off, so not necessarily her fault. When we finally received our drinks (2 white sangrias, 1 mojito, 1 Jamaican margarita) they were pretty disappointing (and fairly expensive at $9-11). ˜The food was truly fantastic. At the table we had the enchilladas del mar (my favorite of the evening), the mixed meat lava bowl (delicious and plenty of food for 2 people to share), the vegetarian enchilladas, and the vegetarian tamales. Everything was awesome. The prices were a bit steep ($15-22 for entrees) but very good. The bill ended up higher than I would've expected, and the length of time it took to get our drinks was truly appalling. 5 stars if it weren't for the drink snafu (and absolutely nothing done to remedy it) and the fact that they charged us for a second basket of chips (1 basket isn't even enough for 2 people to finish the guac). But the food was delicious enough that we will definitely return!"
10834,46,3,1,9/19/2012,"Came here with Restaurant.com certificate and the waiter tried to initially say that they would not accept it. ˜When I asked to speak to the manager he changed his tune and said they would accept the coupon. ˜ After that initial scam, I tried to focus on the positives of the place. ˜The seating is somewhat compact and you will hear all the conversations around you. ˜I like the fish tacos and give Las Bugambillias praise for their excellent preparation and presentation. ˜I will return here, but I will be prepared, unfortunately, to put up a fight for any discounts that they advertise and then try to withdraw from. ˜ P.S. - The bartender is very good and the manager is excellent. ˜Waitstaff leaves room for improvement."
10835,46,5,1,9/18/2012,"This place is very cozy with a great atmosphere. The staff was friendly and the margaritas were delicious as were the other specialty cocktails. I got the Pineapple Chipotle Marg, perfectly spicy and sweet! We ordered a drink from the small bar while we were waiting for a table. After we ordered we were greeted with warm tortilla chips and a duo of fresh salsas. We ordered the mix ceviche to start. It was perfect! Served with saltines. I liked to add a drop of the spicy salsa to mine, so good! My boyfriend got the seafood enchiladas which were on point and tasted just like a seafood bisque in every bite. I had my favorite chicken enchiladas w/ verde sauce. Very authentic and perfectly seasoned. We will be back!"
10836,46,4,1,9/17/2012,"Firstly, reservations are a must! Extremely tiny establishment, but it has the effect of being intimate and cozy, not claustrophobic. I was quite impressed with the quality of the food at Las Bugambilias (thank you Yelp for telling me about it). The dishes were authentic and of a high quality. I ordered the enchiladas poblanos, which arrived at the bar with beans, rice, and a small lettuce salad. The enchiladas themselves were stuffed with chicken and covered in melted cheese, with pureed pepper sauce draped all over them. Delicious! The portions were not so large that I needed to take them home, but big enough that I was completely satiated. The wait staff was excellent and catered to our every need and then some. I very much appreciated the side of guacamole that arrived only because they heard me talking about it."
10837,46,5,1,9/16/2012,"A great little, hidden Mexican place that's well decorated, got a good vibe, and a place where actual Spanish people go to eat, (I heard Spanish!) Our waitress was so kind to offer my party a taste of their guac after we talked about reading about the guac online! I had the Mole Traditionale, which was delish, but only order if you like Mole sauce.... it was very Mole-ey. Make Reservations! it's small!"
10838,46,4,1,9/16/2012,Surprisingly good familiar Mexican menu in a very nice space.
10839,46,2,1,9/15/2012,Didnt get food b/c its overpriced ($15 for an Enchilada.....come on!!!!) We did get Margaritas. ˜The best think I can say for the tiny ass cup of Dalys Margarita Mix is that it was on happy hour special. ˜Do yourself a favor. ˜Save yourself money and pretension and head down to Copabanana. ˜At least they're honest about what they are.
7315,46,4,1,9/10/2012,"Wanted a nearby place to stop by after a class at Society Hill Dance Academy, so Yelped and came across this place. ˜Walked by to check the menu before class and were greeted (warmly on the edge of too much pressure) by a woman out front of Las Bugambilias. ˜She told us the place was authentic best around, etc. etc. etc. so we told her we'd be back, which we decided before her advances anyway but she probably felt good fro ""winning us over"". Interior here is pretty cool. ˜I've never been in a Mexican grandparent's home before, but I imagine it's similar to this place. ˜A cool grandparent who has traveled the world and likes to booze. Menu here is large. ˜I don't want to say too large, but it made it tough to choose something. ˜Guess I'll have to come back. ˜Had the Enfrijoladas and tried some of the Enchiladas Verdes as well. ˜Neither were the bee's knees, but both far above average. ˜Guac was similar - not the best I've ever had but very good and something I'd order again. ˜Service was generally solid, drinks I had were big and strong so no complaints there. To compare it elsewhere it was better than Xochitl (and way cheaper, more selection) and probably not as good as Lolita, but the fact they have such a large menu and the space is more comfortable, cheaper leads me to thing I'd come back here before the others. ˜Similar to a Cantina, minus hipsters and noise."
10840,46,4,1,9/9/2012,Definitely competes with the likes of El Vez and El Rey. ˜The Tacos Pastor and the pork torta were very good. ˜Next time I am there Ill have to try their drinks
8408,46,4,1,9/3/2012,"The food here was amazing! I just returned from Cancun the other day and was craving some authentic Mexican. My girlfriend and I had the Guacamole (which was nice and chunky), Cochinita Pibil & the filet mignon dish with cheese (can't remember the name). There was a ton of food, the filet melted in your mouth and the pork was flavorful with the plantain. The only negative was the service, it seemed like the only waiters were a mother and her son? You could hear them arguing about how many tables each of them had (at the time there was like 5-6 tables, not too busy. We had the son, who took a while to bring us our menus, take our order and never asked how the food was. We had to stop him just to get our check. I would eat here again, but perhaps just get carryout."
10841,46,4,1,9/2/2012,Great Mexican food. Have to try the Lava Bowl. ...to die for. Only complaint is the restaurant is very small. Only a handful of tables
10842,46,1,1,8/30/2012,"So I'm not usually one to give a place a terribly negative review, but the servers here truly earned it. The food was pretty good, but our service was pretty terrible. First, the entire meal (which included three entrees, nothing more) took about two hours b/c the servers were shockingly slow with absolutely everything. My friend ordered the pineapple-chipotle margarita and it was so spicy and terrible that even after having them attempt to fix the drink and bring her a new one, it was still almost undrinkable. Then they brought out guacamole, which we though was just a free starter, but the proceeded to take it from us after we'd already eaten some and give it to the people who actually ordered it (sooo that's gross). Finally, we asked for separate checks and after 5-10 minutes realized that the person we talked to never even told our waitress. So we had to ask again. When we finally got our checks, we were determined to tip low since throughout all of these screwups, there were no apologies or really any friendliness. And of course the waitress added a 20% gratuity without even asking and there were only three of us. Staff at Bugambilias: you earned this terrible review. Please stop adding a high tip to your checks when you most definitely did not earn it. That was a low move and I will not be back."
10843,46,5,1,8/26/2012,"Food was great,atmosphere great....waitress a little abrupt but fast"
10844,46,4,1,8/12/2012,"Went to Las Bugambilias this past Saturday night. This time I took the wife so she could experience the flavors of Las Bugambilias. This was her first visit and I wanted to make sure she had a good experienced as I did on my first visit. The experience did not start out so well. We were placed at a table located at the very back of ˜the restaurant. This place struggles to seat as many people as possible so they placed a table where they shouldn't have. The table needs to be completely pulled away from the corner in order for someone to get in or out. ˜I can tell the two people with their backs to us with the party of four sitting adjacent from us, were uncomfortable as they were not able to leave their seats as well. If one of those individuals had a need to use the restroom, it would have disturbed my dinner. It was bad enough that every time someone ˜went to the the bathroom, the saloon doors would swing and hit my chair forcing us to push the table further into the corner. This issue could have easily ruined the experience as I can tell my wife was a little uncomfortable. If not for anything else this table should be removed for emergency purposes. In addition to this matter our ˜drinks were pretty mediocre. My wife had a margarita and I had the Vodka margarita and they both were pretty awful. Once we received our appitizers things started to look-up. We ordered the empanadas and Guacamole. When ordering empanadas, I expect to receive two crispy pastries. The empanadas were served covered in tomatillo sauce. It is not what I am used to, but it certainly worked. The empanadas managed to stay crispy despite being covered in tomatillo sauce, and it only enhanced the flavor of the empanadas. My wife loves guacamole she tries it at just about every Mexican establishment we visit. She had nothing but praise for the ˜guacamole here. Ok things are picking up. When the entree's arrived my wife couldn't believe the amount of food sitting in front of her for just three fish tacos. They don't over do the portions here, but if you leave here hungry, that sounds like a you problem. I ordered the same thing I had on my last visit, the Cochinita Pibil. I was all happy to dig in when....BOOM....the saloon doors hit the back of my chair for the fifth time. This table really needs to be removed. So as I was saying the entree's arrived and everything looked good. ˜The pork was not bad but tasted slightly different from the last time I had it. I was wondering if it was because I got the first batch of the day when I was there for lunch compared to going there at 8:30 at night. Like I said it wasn't bad by any stretch and every piece of pulled pork never made its way back to the kitchen. My wife truly enjoyed her fish tacos. Her only complaint was that the batter was a little too moist. I almost removed a star from this overall dining experience due to ˜a poor seating location. Like I said, it almost ruined my wive's first experience and the joy I get from taking her places for the first time and watching her enjoy herself. However I didn't want my review to diminish the quality of the food, or the quality of the service at this place because both are way above average. I will be back here again of course....but please move that table."
10845,46,4,1,8/10/2012,"Came here with my boyfriend's brother & fiance, as it is apparently their favorite Mexican restaurant in Philly. It was a smaller place but loved the decor. The food was delicious, bright, and fresh - ˜definitely the most authentic Mexican I've had. We got the mixto ceviche as an appetizer which started to fill me up already in combination with the chips and salsa. Entrees were a shrimp dish, bacon covered chicken (can't go wrong there), and a fried whole fish, all served with either rice/beans/salad or a combo of those. The black beans were too salty in my opinion but I cared more about the main course anyway which was delicious. We asked for extra garlic and they piled it on, which added to the taste. I never heard of this place...it's located close to Xochitl so perhaps it's been overshadowed, but is well worth trying."
10846,46,5,1,7/12/2012,"If you are looking for good quality authentic mexican food this is the place. The food here is really tasty and really special. ˜You can tell a lot of heart goes into this restaurant. ˜The atmosphere is friendly, the food is excellent, and the service is spot on. A Philadelphia foodie MUST."
10847,46,4,1,7/10/2012,"Yummy. Make reservations in advance because the place gets really crowded quickly...it's about the size of a matchbox. That said, I really enjoyed my meal here. The portions were really large and everything tasted fresh. Fairly priced and I didn't leave feeling like I spent $40 on a Chipotle Burrito. I ordered some type of enchilada with Chicken (don't remember the name) but it was muy buena. The servers were courteous and consistently checked up on me and my friend even though we had to sit at the bar (no seating). I would recommend it to visitors (please avoid the diner down the street)."
10848,46,4,1,7/10/2012,"Great local mexican eatery. Go for the happy hour margaritas, and stay for dinner. A lovely spot to bring your family and friends."
10849,46,4,1,7/2/2012,"I know I just wrote a review a week ago for my previous experiences, but I just went back over the weekend. After a failed visit to the Philly Food Tour (NOT as good as Night Market, so I would skip this), we walked over to Las Bugambilias. Luckily for us, no wait at 8 PM Saturday night, but this may be because of the above event. Service was fine. $1 charge for the extra chips, fine, since I knew it was coming. Their thick-cut, fried chips come with mild tomato salsa and another that is really spicy. Friend ended up getting the pork chop, which was seasoned well, but a bit overcooked and dry. My enchiladas verde were still on point. They give you a side of their mole which is pretty good. Their dessert coffee (can't think of the name, and their website is down) was very sweet with an orange slice on the side of the cup. I'm more of the dark, bitter, black coffee type, but if you like coffee that tastes like coffee ice cream, get this and add milk. The TRES LECHES (de amarillo) was quite possibly the best tres leches I've ever had. Super moist, and perfectly sweet, this dish made the 1 mile walk back worth it (and necessary)."
10850,46,3,1,6/23/2012,"You'd think the Ukranian in our midst would order a cocktail; after all, she comes from a family that buried a bottle of vodka on the day of her birth and offered to open it when she turned thirty (a fashionable blonde, she has most definitely aged better than the vodka). ˜Alas, she ordered sangria--her first!--while the rest of us kicked back margaritas. ˜Cacti were spotted on the menu, and having recently read a cactus recipe involving the word ""mucus,"" I insisted we try the spiny vegetable. ˜The doctor at the table said they tasted like grilled peppers and resembled bodily discharge not at all. ˜I was content to take him at his word."
10851,46,5,1,6/10/2012,Absolutely delicious! ˜My enchiladas were fantastic and my waiter was so attentive. The restaurant is tiny but as soon as I finished with plates she picked them up which helped me feel not claustrophobic. I highly recommend Las Bugambilias!
10852,46,1,1,6/3/2012,"Food is fancy schmancy mexican by gringos. Chip are tasty but you get about 10, maybe we would have gotten refills if the staff wasn't terribly rude, unattentive, and act like they wish we never walked in. Never asked if we needed anything else, droppde off water and ran. Dropped off entrees and ran. Dropped off bill and ran. When I walked in I could have taken the entire restaurant before anyone came out from the back. Ugggg terrible service will ruin any dish."
10853,46,5,1,5/28/2012,"Best Mexican food I've had, everything was extremely fresh. We went when it was packed so the service was a little slow, but the waitress apologized and even gave us some delicious complimentary flan for desert. We'll definitely be back in the future."
10854,46,4,1,5/16/2012,"Good food, good atmosphere, but needs more waiters."
10855,46,5,1,5/5/2012,"Delicious food, friendly service, cozy/romantic ambiance. Try the guacamole, the chicken mole, and the seafood enchiladas!"
10856,46,4,1,4/21/2012,"wonderful, vibrant, authentic little hideaway on south street. Staff was sweet and attentive, food was muy bueno! --downside...small/cramped. all in all and place worth going back to!"
10857,46,5,1,4/16/2012,"Went for breakfast on our 2nd day visiting Philly and it was definitely a great choice! My bf and I started off with a cafe de holla and pan. To our surprise it came with a slice of orange on the rim which gave it a delicious tangy aftertaste. My bf got the chilaquiles w/ steak and I had the huevos y carne and one enchilada (eggs and steak cooked medium well). Our food was cooked to perfection, everything tasted amazing. it was an wonderful arrangement of different tastes and colors in our plates. Not to mention, we couldn't help but admire how authentically decorated it was. Great little place to eat and if I am ever in Philly again, will def. be going back!!"
10858,46,2,1,3/21/2012,I used to really love this place! ˜I'm not sure if they changed management or cooks or what but the food this past time I went was nowhere near the quality of the previous few times. ˜The food used to be delicious here as it was supposedly an old chef from Tequila's. ˜We've never really had any complaints and we go here every few months but the food this past time was horrendous. ˜The ceviche wasn't even ceviche because it was completely cooked. ˜The portions of the guac were smaller than it used to be served. ˜We got charged for extra chips which was like a small little basket. ˜I'm not sure if this was just an isolated occurrence or what but this past experience was bad and nothing like what this place used to be.
10859,46,5,1,3/11/2012,"Places like this represent why Mexican might be my favorite cuisine. This place gets it, fresh ingredients with big bold flavors. There is a ton of variety in the menu and everything is very reasonably priced for the quantity that you get. Friday night had a full crowd for dinner. It is pretty small inside but has a nice home style vibe. We were seated promptly for our 8:00 reservation and had great service throughout the meal. As previously stated, there is no skimping on their plates. For appetizers I tried to the queso with chorizo and the tamales. The queso was bubbling hot with the perfect amount of spices. The homemade tortillas made for the perfect vehicle to shove everything they offered into my mouth. The tamales were overstuffed with super tender pork. I almost ate the corn husk just to get a last taste of the marinade. My surf and turf entree (the first one listed under the beef section of the menu) was a home run. It came out in a stone vessel that kept it warm since it took a while to take down this heaping mound of deliciousness. A couple smokey shrimp, a tender piece of filet and two giant chunks of chicken breast all in a spicy sauce with onions and peppers among other goodies. It also came with more tortillas, black beans, rice, and guac with a chip in case I wasn't already at capacity. Since everything was so good we had to get dessert to go and the chocolate tres leche and a chocolate strawberry tort were both 5 star worthy. Over the course of the night I tried 5 of their margaritas too. On the pricey side at ~$11 but a must have compliment to their cuisine. My favorite was the Jamaican marg although I guess its a bit fruity for a guy. The chipotle pineapple is unique and as a spicy enthusiast I loved it. The blood orange and traditional reminded me of Lolita (that's a big compliment). I can't wait to go back to and try everything else considering everyone else in the restaurant seemed to be enjoying their plates as much as me."
10339,46,4,1,3/8/2012,"The Ceviche Mixto is delicious. It's a popping amalgamation of some cooked fish - shrimp and things - and some raw fish, along with chunks of mango, tomato, onion, and herbs that just makes your mouth smile. The Mixto donates a variety of flavors and textures to your longing tastebuds: there's sweet, sour, umami, creamy, chunky, smooth, and crunchy. Give this dish a shot: you'll be super pleased. Use it as a dip for your slightly plump, perfectly golden, delightfully crunch chips and you'll be even happier. Everything else is good. The Spicy Shrimp dish served over a bed of herbs and non-Romaine greens was tasty. The sides of beans were black, creamy, and topped with the essential Mexican cheese."
10860,46,4,1,3/6/2012,"Las Bugambilias is a quality restaurant, serving quality food and very nice service. Solidly four stars, nowhere near five nor three. The website savored.com (offering 30% discounts on ENTIRE checks, including alcohol for a small fee) was giving away free res's and because mexican is a daily requirement for me.. here we went! The whole experience I thought was really great, especially since I was nervous using a new discount company, heightening the jewwy coupon-like embarrassment I always feel when using some type of promo. We were warmly greeted at the door by my name, which I was pleasantly surprised by, and they had already anticipated our reservation by securing a four-top table all set up and ready to go for us. Which, thank god, because the restaurant is smaller than, seriously, my living room and we definitely would have waited without a reservation. The tables and chairs are incredibly close together, and the bar only has about four seats. The small theme continues inside the bathroom to a much larger degree. A 5'5"" person should not have to bend down to look into the bathroom mirror! But whatev, you get to enter through saloon doors. Nice. The atmosphere is cool and casual, which I liked. Parking wasn't an issue at all, as it's not on the busiest end of south st. The four of us ordered a round of margaritas and sangrias. The sangria was pretty tasty, but I thought my margarita was just okay. It wasn't quite as smooth as I would have liked for an 11 dollar pricetag. As everyone else has said, the order of chips and salsa you get is almost laughable if you were to compare to a casual Mexican restaurant. For higher end, it's not that abnormal. The guacamole is reasonable at about $6 and is tasty, but is tiny as well. Highly recommend the soups! All of our entrees were really delish; I thought the standout being my bestie's grouper etc. dish. There were other things with it, but the details are fuzzy. The sauce on the plate was probably my favorite of the night. Entrees run about All in all, the total for 4 people including apps, 2 rounds of drinks, and entrees was about 140 dollars. We got 40 taken off our bill due to savored.com, and again I was really ˜happy that our server put it on discretely without having to ask about it or be reminded. Made for a really smooth process. The restaurant is pretty expensive, you can see, but with the 30% off, I thought it was worth it. Our experience was fun and yummy, but I don't really feel the need to go back anytime soon."
10861,46,5,1,3/6/2012,"Amazing food. ˜Fresh, delicious and full of flavor. I had the Empanadas, the Tacos Camaron, and the Tacos Pastor. ˜I opted to have the Empanadas vegetarian, and I didn't miss the meat one bit. ˜They were savory and flavorful. ˜Tacos Camaron were amazing. ˜Creamy delicious sauce and cheese with shrimp cooked to perfection. ˜Lastly the Tacos Pastor were probably my favorite. ˜Pork mixed with Pineapple with a light and refreshing sour cream and a squirt of lime made them heavenly. ˜I WILL be ordering from this place on a regular basis. ˜Can't wait to bring my friends here to have some drinks and an amazing meal! ˜DON'T PASS THIS UP! Rivals any of the food on or around South Street!"
10862,46,3,1,2/21/2012,"Food was great. Service sucked. 4 stars for food. Coming from SoCal, I'm always on the search for great Mexican. Las Bugambilias is as close to great as I've found so far in Philly. There are a few good higher end Mexican places like El Vez but few good traditional places that I've found. Las Bugambilias so far is one of the better ones. 2 stars for service. First, we had to wait for 40 minutes for our 9pm Friday night reservation and we kept being told that the people at our table were lingering over drinks after dinner. I don't think a restaurant should blame patrons for lingering but instead shouldn't take a reservation when a table for 4 won't be available reasonably around that time. Then we were the last ones in the restaurant so they were rushing us out. So frustrating after they made us wait. Also we had mentioned how hungry we were when we sat down and immediately ordered guacamole from the hostess who seated us but despite that it took a long while until anyone came to take our orders and then we had to repeat our guac order since it hadn't been put in. Last complaint, tiny bowls of chips for the table do we kept asking for more chips to go with the guac and salsa, which would have been fine but for the chip refill charge on the bill. Only a dollar per refill, but it was annoying on principle. All in all the food redeemed the service, but the poor service really lowered my view of the restaurant."
10863,46,3,1,2/19/2012,"If this was just based on food, it would be five stars - one of the best tasting meals we have had in Philly. The restaurant seemed understaffed and staff seemed confused - we waited far too long on everything (our lunch took just under two hours)...so if you've got time to kill, go here. We highly recommend the enchiladas de mole and the first chicken dish on the menu (can't remember the name, sorry!)."
10864,46,5,1,2/16/2012,"Absolutely AMAZING food! We stopped in here to fill up after working the long weekend at the Philly Tattoo Convention and it was better than we could have even hoped for! The soup that I had was ridiculously delicious. ˜The hot molten bowls of meaty goodness that the boys ate had them drooling for more, even after their stomachs were completely full. ˜ The only thing that I regret is not having room for desert..."
10865,46,4,1,2/13/2012,"Let me first say that pronouncing Las Bugambilias if you do not have any kind of background speaking spanish makes you sound like an idiot. Anyway, I booked a table for 8 through Savored (30% off your bill) for my birthday dinner on a Friday night. There was a table set up and ready for us, even though it took up about 1/3 of the tiny restaurant. We looked over the extensive drink menu that offered about 10 of each cocktails and margaritas. I went for the sangria ($8), but I tasted my friends' pomegranate and chipotle-pineapple margs ($11) and they were tasty and decently strong. One thing that really turned me off however was that we saw a pitcher sitting on another table, and pitchers are not listed on the menu. When we asked about it, she told us they have pitchers of margaritas and sangria and they have about 6 glasses each at around $12 less than what it would cost to order separately. I felt that this should have been offered as an option when the first round of 3 was ordered, since they knew it was a bday dinner and we would probably order a second round. They give you chips and salsa when you sit down, and you can tell the chips are homemade. The green salsa they give you is awesome - definitely hot which was refreshing since salsa verde is usually mild. We ordered nachos and queso fundido as appetizers. The queso fundido was a amazing (but, how can melted cheese not be?) and topped with chorizo, chopped tomatoes and avocados. The nachos were different from what i'm used to - they were covered in what tasted like a pinto bean puree and were topped with just veggies, cheese, and sour cream. The other side of the table ordered pork tamales and tacos al pastor (pork and pineapple) and they got rave reviews. Two appetizers were the perfect size to share between 4 people. Our entrees took quite a while to come out. I would say at least 20 if not 30 min. It was fine because we weren't in a rush, but since we got appetizers, but the time our entrees arrived everyone was already pretty full. Most people got the fish tacos ($18) or some version of enchiladas ($12-16), and one person got the chicken mole ($18). I tasted the mole and I wasn't a fan, but I think that's mostly my taste preferences. The fish tacos were pretty good - three huge tacos piled with beer battered fish, guac and red onions. The fish was in many small pieces instead of one big one which made it difficult to eat, but it still tasted good. Most fish tacos I've had come with some sort of salsa/slaw/crunch factor which was lacking on these, but a little of that green salsa solved that problem. Everyone really liked their enchiladas, especially the seafood version, which were all smothered generously with sauce and cheese. The man at the table next to us sold us on getting dessert, especially one in particular. He said this dessert - the Jericalla a la Grand Marnier con Cajeta Mexicana ($6) - often sells out early in the night because of it's high demand. We looked over the other desserts - there are about ten - and I was very tempted to try more but since everyone was so full we settled for one Jericalla with a lot of spoons. Our neighbor was on point. This tasty custard was topped with a silky caramel sauce, fresh berries, and whipped cream. I am still thinking about it, and when I can return to get more. Overall the food here was pretty tasty and definitely the most authentic I've had in Philly. The prices were pretty high, especially for south street, but the 30% off made them reasonable. Definitely make a reservation if you can, and give yourself a while since service can be fairly slow."
10866,46,5,1,1/29/2012,"Hands down the best Mexican food in Philadelphia. I have eaten at more than a dozen Mexican restaurants in Philly -- from the vaunted to the anonymous. ˜The food here is just amazing. ˜And it's a lot closer than Texas or So. Cal. ˜The Carne Tampique?a was amazing. ˜The mole sauce over the enchilada was sheer perfection -- you could actually taste the chocolate in the sauce. ˜ No, the service wasn't perfect, but the prices -- enters generally under $20 -- were very reasonably priced."
10867,46,4,1,1/4/2012,"A little gem of a restaurant on South Street (near Front). ˜Delicious food (probably my favorite Mexican in the city). ˜Competent, friendly staff. We've been here on quiet nights and busy weekend nights. ˜Each time service and food have been fantastic. ˜A wonderful discovery in Philly, even if it is small and the decor a bit kitschy!"
10868,46,2,1,12/28/2011,"Very small place. Great food. But when you have a restaurant this small, owner can't be so eccentric that they throw a birthday party for themselves that practically closes the place down during dinner hour! WTF was this owner thinking?!?"
10869,46,3,1,12/11/2011,"A small place. The food is very good, but if there are any more than two tables being served, service slows down to a crawl because there is only one waitstaff, and she doesn't seem to manage her time very well. But if you go outside of lunch and dinner times, be prepared for a very good experience!"
10870,46,2,1,11/21/2011,"First of all, there should be $$$ instead of $$ for this restaurant - talk about pricey !!! Food was decent, nothing special. Place is small. Waitress charged my CC twice possibly because she was rushing around with limited help. No good, but they fixed it. Not a fan overall. The outdoor skeleton decor lured me in, and I guess I had higher expectations. Plenty of great Mexican restaurants in Philly - El Rey, El Vez. El Camino, Los Segundos - better than this for sure."
10871,46,5,1,11/18/2011,Amazing food and drinks. Only problem is its a tiny place so if it's crowded you might need reservations and you will be defiantly sitting on top of others. Please don't go and be the loud drunk. Thanks!
7519,46,5,1,11/16/2011,"new favorite mexican restaurant in the city! my brother was in town and craving mexican so we went for lunch upon a friends recommendation and it really lived up! got there around 1:30 on a weekday so it was towards the end of the rush, if there is one. the bartender was our server. ˜she was polite and helpful without being overbearing. shared guacamole to start, tasty and fresh though a bit small. ˜they fill it into a fried shell and put the shell into a mortar bowl - molcajete, i believe it is called? the fresh salsas brought out with it were delicious and fresh, there was a pico de gallo and a spicy verde. the the mains i got fish tacos and he got chicken enchiladas in verde sauce. ˜they were both so good. the fish tacos were tasty beer batter that is slightly sweet, the tortillas did not fall apart and they were topped with salsa, guac, onions and maybe something else. ˜they were overstuffed, i had to eat a few pieces of the fish before i could fold it! the enchiladas were perfectly done and baked till slightly browned on top, i already want more. we started with margaritas and they were great, i got a regular one and he got a pineapple chipotle one, i don't really like chipotle but this was good. also all beers are $4! ˜that's a steal. excited to go back but as others have mentioned, the 2 tops are a bit small once you place chips, salsas, drinks, etc on the table. already planning my return visit!"
10872,46,5,1,11/11/2011,"I have only been once so far, but I am absolutely in LOVE with this place. My Dad and Mom were coming up to visit my sister and I, and they asked if I knew any good Mexican restaurants around. I threw out the stock names, but they were all booked (Xotchil and El Vez) so I turned to yelp for a hand. Everyone who reviewed this place was spot on. Atmosphere: Cozy, a little jammed because of how small it is, but I never felt trapped like I do in restaurants that are very tiny. Very cool glass and dishware. The room felt so cheerful after being out in the blustery cold all day with them, very warm and inviting but not over the top gaudy and over the top ˜like some other ethnic restaurants. ˜ Food: I can't find the name of the dish I got, but it was unreal! It came out in a stone bowl filled with shrimp/steak/chicken as well as some sort of sauce. You had to dig in with a fork and then make a burrito. It was quite messy, though, because at one point I went to get something out of it and the fork flew out and sauce rained on the people next to our table. Thankfully they were cool! Service: Very polite, no one was lingering over us or pointing out that we were butchering the names of the dishes. Everything came out really fast, and everything we had was piping hot. I usually avoid South Street like the plague, but I'm glad I went anyway. Though I went with my family, the restaurant seems custom fit for people dating. I am actually planning on taking my date there on Sunday. I wish there was a place like this nearer to where I live. Downsides: The location, since South Street is kinda blah, or ""flash mobby"" if you will. However, for food this good it's worth the trip. Las Bugambilias is added to my top 5 restaurants in Philadelphia. For real."
10873,46,2,1,11/11/2011,I was really craving mexican food so we went here. The food was okay. nothing to brag about. what turned me off the most is the huge scorpion looking bug i saw crawling up the wall. the waitress saw it and ran over and knocked it off the wall with a plate. i immediately felt nauseous and wanted to leave fast. unfortunately circumstances like that make me not want to ever go back there.
10874,46,5,1,11/11/2011,"Really good mexican food with amazing drinks. ˜A little on the pricey side when you include drinks, but worth all the money. ˜Try the mole enchiladas and amazing pink margaritas, any flavor."
10875,46,5,1,11/10/2011,"This is my first review in a while and I can think of no better return to the world of Yelp than singing the praises of Las Bugambilias! Went with the s/o for his going away dinner. We were seated right away and even though the space was small, we weren't at all uncomfortable and the waitress was so nice and super attentive. Guacamole was great. I had the molcajete arrachera and he had some sort of chicken that was served in a lava bowl. Both were amazing and came in generous portions. I ˜was tempted to take off one star because they didn't have most of the dessert menu available the night I went, but the special dessert they did have (sweet plantains, vanilla ice cream with fresh caramel sauce was well worth me having to me rolled out of there on my side because I was so full. (Although the XXX margaritas may have had something to do with that too!)"
10876,46,4,1,11/8/2011,"I don't normally go to South Street area or restaurants. ˜Besides Percy Street, I just think of South Street as a place for nondiscriminating tourists who will eat any old slop food just because the restaurant happens to be located South Street. ˜But was looking to try a new Mexican spot, and found this place on yelp. ˜Menu looked awesome so figured I'd give them a try. Really enjoyed my meal and the server was great! Spilled my whole margarita all over the bar within minutes of arriving, which was pretty frigin embarrassing, but our server/bartender made me another at no cost. Tried the guacamole, queso fundido, ceviche mixto and pork tamales. ˜Everything was fresh and delicious. ˜Ceviche had crab, flounder and shrimp and the perfect amount of citrus flavor. ˜Pork tamales could have had a bit more shredded pork, but not a huge deal. Place is totally unpretentious and the food and service were top notch."
7624,46,4,1,11/6/2011,"Walked in with a friend late on a weekday, and I'm so glad that I did. Great service, first of all! The folks here are way friendly and non-pretentious. I appreciated that they took all of our requests into consideration and that our waitress was particularly knowledgeable about the menu. Of course, this review is mostly about the food, and it doesn't disappoint. Having just come back from El Paso, Phoenix, etc., I've had my fill of good food. While this place is going to be pricey for what you pay in comparison, the quality is just as high. Fresh veggies and fruit, and absolutely delicious meats and beans tasting like they came straight from grandmom's kitchen. My only complaint is that I asked for my food very spicy, and it came out mild. Maybe it's just the chiles this year (they were weak down in the SW), but man, what a bummer. That and the price bring this place down a star for me, but I would argue that it's one of the better value places for Mexican in the area. You still get a ton of food, and it's absolutely to die for delicious and authentic. I'll be back! ˜You've made my list:)"
10877,46,5,1,10/13/2011,"Just an FYI for anyone considering trying Las Bugambilias...Las Bugambilias is a Restaurant and NOT a Taquer­a. If you want good low priced traditional Mexican food (Taquer­a) try La Veracruzana off Washington Ave. This place far exceeds typical Mexican food in flavor and creativity! So here is the short and sweet on this excellent establishment: Guacamole - $6.00- great flavor fresh ingredients nice kick Sopes Veracruzanos - $6.00- My favorite app by far is the vegetarian sopes with corn, zucchini and pumpkin blossoms...amazing! Better than the beef and chicken sopes...trust me. Camarones Rellenos - $19.00- Generous size shrimp stuffed with cheese, pumpkin blossoms, zucchini, and wrapped with bacon...very delicious Restaurant has warm ambience with colorful traditional Mexican paintings/d?cor accompanied with classic black and white photography. Establishment is cozy NOT small, not the best for large parties (bigger than 6) but blends flavors not associated with typical Mexican cuisine. My favorite Mexican Restaurant ˜so far."
8604,46,5,1,10/10/2011,"Las Bugambilias has got to be my favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. The guacamole and ceviche are absolutely delicious and as fresh as it gets. Seafood lovers, order the Enchiladas del Mar smothered with the poblano sauce. you won't regret it! And sure, the space is small, but it's never been a problem. I've had a company dinner here once and they were able to accommodate 15 of us without any problems."
10878,46,4,1,9/26/2011,"Las Bugambilias is a great place to go for quality Mexican food and a lovely homely decor. ˜It's decorated so nicely that I often feel like I""ve been transported away from the craziness of South Street and into Mexico. They start you off with some tortilla chips and salsa. ˜It's fresh and yummy but I do wish they would give you more chips esp if you order the guacamole as an appetizer. ˜I also like ordering the nachos de la frontera! I've tried a few entrees and for the most part, they have been really delicious. ˜The chile rellenos, enchiladas verde, & the poultry dishes are always great choices. ˜However, their seafood dishes that I've had have never been good -- I do not recommend ordering seafood from them! ˜ ˜ Overall, good service, cheerful decor, & great food - minus the seafood!"
10879,46,4,1,9/12/2011,"I've eaten here three times and found the food to be consistently very good, the service attentive and friendly, the decor and atmosphere cheery, comfortable, and welcoming. The mixed drinks are quite tasty, the guacamole superior, salsas with the chips above average- plus, they bring both a mild salsa cruda and spicy salsa picante with high quality chips. And the entrees....never had a bad meal here, nor have my dining companions. The enchiladas verdes were prepared well and, as with most of their dishes, offered a more than adequate portion size. The sides were good and appropriate. The people I was with had the pulled pork and the spicy shrimp. Both tasted great and offered substantial portions, though I thought the shrimp was a little tame given its description. The dining room is crowded and I've always had to wait for a table here....but it's well worth it! Best Mexican food I've found in Philadelphia."
10880,46,2,1,8/24/2011,Literally smelled like urine. Giving it two stars instead of one because we didn't actually taste any food before leaving so who knows.
10881,46,3,1,8/23/2011,"I really wanted to like Las Bugambilias more than i did. The spot, right off Headhouse Square is much smaller than I had imagined, with a tiny bar up front that puts out a decent margarita. The cocktail list is awfully pricey though. The cochinita pibil wasn't available, so I had the enchiladas mole, which were really good. My wife's enchiladas verde were just as good. Our tamale appetizer was cold and crumbly however, a disappointment after it was recommended by our server. I'm not rushing back, there's too many other Mexican options, but Las Bugambilias is definitely a serviceable option. I was just expecting more."
10882,46,5,1,8/16/2011,"I love this place. ˜The people are so nice, the margs are great, the decor makes you feel like you're in a little Mexican village, and the food is definitely a big ramp up from the usual. ˜It's the kind of homey food your grandmother would make... if she were Mexican and a really good cook. ˜The flavors are stand alone and unique. ˜And a great variety to choose from. ˜If you like cheviche, this is your place."
10883,46,5,1,8/12/2011,"Great service, cool decors, convenient location, delicious guacamole. I gotta say it was probably most fresh/chunky guacamole that I've ever tasted. I ordered Enchiladas with mole sauce and it was great. It was my first time trying the mole sauce and it was interesting chocolate-based sauce that went well with everything else on the plate. It would've been nice if there was more rice,though. It might be little more $$ than other mexican restaurants but it's a must-try restaurant on South st. ˜=)"
10884,46,4,1,8/10/2011,"Very, very, VERY good. And even though it's not a BYO, the wine is the most affordable I've seen. Great experience."
10885,46,4,1,8/6/2011,"The first time that I was fortunate enough to experience Las Bugambilias (which, despite being a reasonably intellegent person, I am incapable of pronouncing correctly), I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by 3 of ˜my impressively carnivorous friends, and our performance did not disappoint. ˜I do not recall our exact meal as it was about a year ago, but suffice it to say that we left no menu item unturned on that blissfully indulgent evening. ˜ I love Mexican food and will enjoy it from Taco Bell to Lolita. ˜However, Las Bugambilias is different than any Mexican restaurant at which I have dined. ˜The menu has some different flavors than is typical and the dishes are really bursting with flavor but somehow do not overwhelm the complimentary items on the plate. ˜I ordered the hangar steak in my most recent visit and not only what the steak extremely flavorful but the sauce was divine and it went stunningly well with the mole enchilada that comes on the same plate and lasted there for about 2.4 seconds. ˜From what I have heard, the pork entree (which made top 100 meals you have to try in Philly or something like that) is groundbreaking. Why 4 stars and not 5? ˜Well, I'm becoming stingy in my advanced age and I don't want to give 5 stars to a restaurant where I am not absolutely sure that the operation is 100% consistent. ˜I did have a meal that was a bit overcooked and a steak that was tough. ˜This is nitpicking, however, and I would strongly suggest stopping by for dinner and/or drinks."
10886,46,4,1,7/28/2011,"Stopped in for light lunch today with my wife. ˜Ordered the Mexican salad & tortilla soup for me and an enchilada plate for my wife. ˜All food was ˜excellent. ˜Plenty of it.

Don't expect common Americanized Mexican food. ˜ Nice atmosphere.. Small and cozy. ˜Also not your typical South Street touristy place."
10887,46,2,1,7/27/2011,"The food was really good, but there were a few things that spoiled the experience. We didnt have a reservation, but they had a table, so we sat. They didnt pay any attention to us. It was like we were second class. We ordered our drinks and asked for water. Well, we asked for water 4 times. Our drinks took until our entrees came. We ordered guacamole, which was great, but it came with a handful of chips. We asked for more, but were charged $2 without being told. Dont give us 5 chips then! The dessert was okay, but it said chocolate cake, but had no chocolate, but apparently was what we ordered. Its a cute place and great for happy hour."
10888,46,4,1,7/5/2011,"I finally checked this place out last night w/ some friends we had a very tasty feast. Definitely seemed like authentic Mexican food, and I enjoyed my Jamica Margarita. It's a little pricier than what I'm used to paying for Mexican, but then again, the quality was worthy of it. Looking forward to going back to try the Mole Enchiladas that i read about from another reviewer."
10889,46,4,1,6/25/2011,"Based on margaritas and guacamole alone, was starting to doubt the other reviews. But then my (chicken) Mole Tradicionale arrived. Yum! Chicken was moist and delicious, mole was tasty. Prompt and friendly service, as others described. Nice place to spend a little time."
7637,46,4,1,6/21/2011,"The food here is phenomenal. Pretty authentic. Service was a bit less than perfect. Waited 20 minutes for a soda and water. Drinks came a half hour after we ordered them. Waitress was very nice though. White sangria was off the hook! Although, I could do without the fly in my glass."
10890,46,4,1,6/16/2011,"I lived in southern California for a long time so I'm a bit spoiled when it comes to Mexican food. Most of the Mexican spots I've eaten at downtown have been junky to edible at best but this is an exception. I would have given it 5 stars but there are a few rough spots which I'll cover briefly - they aren't huge, just noticeable. Overall, the presentation and setting is great. One thing I always thought that was silly is how each place setting has multiple plates per person. I've ordered many different things but it always seems like they remove half of my plates. Their salsa and home made chips are great even though you don't get a lot of them. I'm not counting this as a negative because typically your food comes out promptly and being full on chips makes it hard to wade through a big platter of steaming hot delicious food. I've had the (I'm not going to even humor you with my attempt at remembering the Hispanic words for the meals) turkey mole, stuffed pepper and steak (this is awesome!), a few of the shrimp platters, everything has been awesome. Their beans and rice are always fresh, nothing worse than refried-reheated beans, yuck. I've never had deserts there but they do look good, typically I'm stuffed by the end. Overall, it's a gem on South st. I'd recommend it. On to the few negatives. It is a small place. If you want to go on a Thur-Sat evening without a reservation, good luck. If you're out and about and want to drop in with a few friends without a reservation, good luck, they just don't have a lot of seats. Since it is small, you're pretty intimate with your neighbors. If you're big on your personal space, this may gig you. I'm amazed the wait staff does such a great job navigating through the tight walkways without spilling food. Unfortunately, they do take big parties (8-10) but you'd be buddyspiking everyone elses experience because noise carries in close quarters and you've just absorbed 1/3 of the seats."
10891,46,3,1,4/16/2011,"I don't know- just wasn't a big fan of this place. Salsa was average. The salsa fresca was tasty but boring and the other salsa was ridiculously hot. Our queso appetizer was a greasy mess of cheese, my $9 margarita was average and not worth $9, and the carnitas tacos that I had as a main course was slightly greasy and kind of boring.. Overall average Mexican food (I'm cursing all the amazing joints on the west coast that have turned me into a Mexican food snob). Where are the tasty cheap taquerias in Philly??"
10892,46,5,1,4/2/2011,"I've eaten here once, and it offered the best enchiladas I've ever had. ˜The mole sauce is amazing...like nothing I've ever eaten. ˜Superb. ˜Get it. ˜I don't recall if there were other selections besides enchiladas, but that appears to be their forte. Wash them down with a pitcher of sangria. ˜ The place is small and a little cramped, but service was prompt and pleasant. ˜You can't beat Society Hill on a pleasant fall night...it is a great evening stroll."
10893,46,4,1,3/24/2011,"Found this place randomly on Open Table. ˜The menu looked good (and they serve conchinita pibil, which I adore), so we decided to try it out. ˜Service was friendly and attentive, but not overbearing. ˜Food was excellent. ˜Very authentic, well prepared, and well presented. ˜Atmosphere is very agreeable. ˜I would give them a 5, but my friend felt his cocktail was a little bit lacking in the alcohol department. ˜Pour those drinks a little heavier, and you'll have them lining up out the door."
10894,46,5,1,3/23/2011,"I could not have been happier with my experience here. The staff were welcoming, responsive, and fun from the moment we arrived until we left. The food was beautifully presented and delicious."
8057,46,5,1,3/14/2011,"After one meal here it's probably premature to declare ""best Mexican food ever"", but I think Las Bugambilias is headed in that direction. Friend E. and I came for Saturday brunch -- it was quiet and we had the complete attention of our server. She was delightful, helpful, friendly - 5 stars just for her. The space is lovely and cozy, I could see a nice fiesta happening in here, and I was completely smitten with the coordinating Mexican pottery with the Mexican Sun Face. The menu is extensive, and we were told all items are available all the time (good to know!) I went for a torta, since I'd never had one before -- I deemed it top #5 sandwiches ever. The vegetarian torta features several delicious vegetables (avocado, portabello, squash) plus queso on a very tasty toasted telera roll. It was accompanied by a salad, the whole thing was perfection. And very filling. Friend E. had an omelette which looked magical. And the coffee was delicious. There is a lot of attention to detail here, and the nice presentation is only second to the fresh ingredients and the care taken in the preparation. I am recommending Las B to everyone I know. And lucky for me it's 5 minutes away!"
10895,46,3,1,3/13/2011,"Las Bugambilias is A-Ok. Maybe 3.5 stars. It's small and cute, service was very pleasant and friendly, and they serve up decent Mexican food. If you have a vegetarian friend and you don't know what mid-range restaurant to bring them to, this place is a safe bet. But while the food was good, the enchiladas I had weren't outstanding. Enchiladas were priced at around $14, chicken dishes around $17, and beef dishes around $21. At those prices, I expect the dishes to have a little more pizazz. To be fair, I don't like paying a lot (like, more than $12) for Mexican food in principle because I know I can get the real stuff in South Philly for super cheap. Still, if you have friends who are less adventurous and unwilling to brave sketchy areas and potential stomach ailments for legit Mexican, this place is definitely a very safe choice for them, and I recommend it over Xochitl. If you do come here, you should make a reservation, because the restaurant was still packed and there were people waiting in the doorway for a table at 10 pm on a Saturday night."
10896,46,4,1,3/7/2011,"Ooz....itzzz good.... 1 PM on a Saturday. Cute but squishy restaurant. Bad when you're seated next to destructive toddlers. Loud, destructive smallies. With a ***restaurant.com gift certificate*** in hand, GF and I went for the ˜ceviche appetizer, ˜which was a symphony of shrimp, flounder, and mango. We all but took the dish to our lips to slurp down the juices ($10). From the lunch menu, we split the ""giant chalupa"" ($11). It was NOT ginormous but very, very well presented with a flamboyant pink and green salad, hot steak fajita-like strips on top of mushed refried beans and a creamy white sauce. Impossible to eat like a lady. And THEN. The ricotta-cheese tart ($5). This small guy was accompanied by a lone strawberry, chocolate streaks on the plate (finger-slipping time!), and a few blueberries. In three spoonfuls, and a begrudging, ""This is your blueberry..."" it was gone. Taste Presentation Flexible ambience all pass with flying colors. The only ""but"" refers to the lunch portions (dinner portions are a different story), which may not satisfy the quarterback who hides within some of us."
10897,46,4,1,3/2/2011,"Awesome mexican food. Enchiladas are my personal favorite. Great place for a date. A little on the expensive side, but worth it."
10898,46,3,1,2/9/2011,"Bugambilia's is very small... not much more than about 30 seats with an oddly prominent bar (right up front, where their sweat-panted/shirted hostess sits and reads literature in her waist-length scarf) and hotel-lobby lighting. Right out of the gate, the drinks were first to disappoint. The chipotle pineapple margarita was served in a salt-rimmed highball glass with lots of ice cubes, and tasted mostly of pineapple, salt and water. ˜For $11 I'd like a bigger serving, and something a bit more complex, at that. There were only about 8 other diners at the time, but our server seemed impatient, as if our presence was merely a distraction. ˜When my dad asked they give you salsa and chips, she didn't indicate that they did, but instead pointed to the nachos on the menu. ˜We convinced him not to take that option, and 10 minutes later, our server came out with complimentary chips and salsa. ˜Why didn't she say before that it is included?! The chips came with two reasonably good sauces. The first was a standard, mild pico de gallo, with fresh ingredients, and the second was a spicy mole/adobo-chipotle mix, that we were able to mix into our entrees to add spice. Between the four of us, we had four different entrees: Enchiladas with bright pea-green Poblano sauce was pretty good, but perhaps lacking in spice.My dad had the lava bowl, which was, indeed, served volcanically hot, with a bubbling red sauce, and chunks of beef. ˜Of all the dishes we had, this was probably the spiciest. At the end of the day, Bugambilia's isn't bad. ˜Most food items were competently executed, but the meal was only average among mid-range Mexican, and memorably eclipsed by the quality and cost of their mixed drinks."
10899,46,1,1,2/5/2011,"My party of four arrived promptly for our 7:45 reservation. By 8:45, we were tired of standing in the cramped front of the restaurant, waiting for our table. We left and went around the corner to Stella where we were seated promptly. After waiting for over ten minutes for someone to acknowledge us (the bartender and three different servers saw us standing there but ignored us), we had to flag down someone to tell them we'd arrived. A few minutes later, someone came over and told us that our table wouldn't be ready till 8:15. By that point, we'd already been there almost fifteen minutes, so what was another fifteen? Well, the fifteen came and went. A table of four that had gotten there AFTER us were seated. We heard them say that their reservation was at 8:00 (remember, ours was for 7:45). Meanwhile, an empty four-top with a ""reserved"" sign sat in front of us. They told us they couldn't seat us there because a party of 11 was coming in soon. The 11 didn't arrive the entire hour we sat there waiting, yet they wouldn't seat us there. Then, they looked at us again and said ""Oh, there are only four of you? We thought there were eight of you. We could've sat you at that other table"" (where the 8:00 reservation sat down). For the next half hour, they checked up on us every five minutes. ""Just a few more minutes,"" they'd say. But still we sat there. We finally asked to see the manager. The hostess disappeared in the back ˜and never came back out, at least not for more than five minutes. By this time, we'd been there for a full hour, so we left. Good riddance. I've never seen such a level of inattention, miscommunication, and ineptitude. I will never, EVER return to this place. It's a joke."
10900,46,3,1,2/1/2011,"OK, But Not ?Ol?! My virgin voyage at Las Bugambilias was solidly, respectably 3-star. The tortilla chips were thick-cut and tasted mainly of salt. The accompanying salsas (a soggy pico and a ""this is very hot"" spread-like concoction) were fine to pass the time. Sangria (see photo) was straightforward if syrupy. I settled for sips instead of gulps ... and then forgot about it. Tortilla soup was served nice and hot as requested, tangy and smooth, and attractively garnished with avocado and cheese, but lacked the healing oomph and roasted nuance of Xochitl's version just up the street. The chicken mole (see photo) was in a long line of moles that make me yearn for ... better moles. It was perfectly acceptable but not delicious. The chicken was a bit rubbery and dry and rather than integrating with the sauce, it resisted it. The accompaniments dressed the plate handsomely but did not delight in flavor. The Spanish rice specked with peas and carrot cubes was mulch-like and past prime, the shredded salad sported the weird, though oddly standard Mexican-restaurant choice of Wishbone-esque Italian dressing, the tostones were noticeably pre-prepped, cool and a bit leaden, and the black bean puree was unseasoned and plain. In all I found Las Bugambilias a pleasant place to dine and a welcome respite from South St. with cheerful, considerate staff, good service and a joyful vibe. I would absolutely recommend it for families, especially on a slower night. But if you're aching for a culinary sensation, Las Bugambilias won't tilt your sombrero."
10901,46,5,1,1/28/2011,"Their soups are great! ˜It's not easy to find great soup. ˜ Good drinks(not waterdown), and foods is very good."
10902,46,5,1,1/20/2011,"Yum. There is an impressive margarita list with flavors such as hibiscus, pomegranate, and blood orange as well as other famous mexican cocktails like mojitos. The guacamole and it was pleasantly spicy and the chips were lightly fried flour tortillas. I tried the vegetarian enchiladas with salsa verde and it was so good, in fact, I don't think our table had a single complaint about the meal. For desert we all tried the cafe de olla and it is an impressive way to make coffee, full of spices that kill the bitterness of regular coffee. It also appears that bugambilias serves breakfast and lunch which i bet is also delicious."
10903,46,4,1,1/19/2011,"I have eaten at this place a few times and I can't wait to go back. The staff is awesome and extremely accomodating to large groups despite the small space. The Queso Chihuahua appetizer is so tasty and delicious I crave it on a weekly basis. Their margaritas could be a tad bit stronger in my opinion. The prices are reasonable and you can buy coupons on restaurant.com, 25.00 coupon for 10.00. Great for groups and date night."
10904,46,5,1,1/15/2011,"This is the best Mexican spot in Philly. ˜The staff was unbelievably friendly, especially considering that we were there passed closing time - we swallowed our food as soon as we realized they were closing shop. Fantastic drinks and nachos. ˜I love that they have the thick cut tortilla chips. ˜Already have my next night here on the calendar... can't wait to get back!"
10905,46,2,1,1/15/2011,"The first 5 times here would have gotten 5 stars. The food and drinks were fantastic. The ceviche is great, and the champagne cocktail(forgot its name) was even better. Guacamole is bland, pass on that. But the last 2 times we ate here the service was the lowest. The one server is overwhelmed and the other seems drunk. The overwhelmed one seems pissed about the other and there is palpable tension in the air. My friends guy ordered a steak rare. It came out well done as in brown to center 3 times before he finally gave up. They tried to argue with him about it and say it was not their fault. I don't know how rare equates to a brown center. It was a hassle getting it off the bill. They didn't offer anything else or anything to compensate for him leaving hungry. We called the manager the next day who did not care one bit. Get off the booze babes! You are running one of Phila best restaurants in the ground. Also, it was hot in the restaurant and the drinks were warm too. Yuck. Just give me Lolitas anyday!!! This place is another no return."
10906,46,5,1,1/12/2011,"Absolutely fantastic! The hubby and I decided to get out tonight (after the huge snowfall :-) and treat ourselves to some upscale mexican food. It was 630pm on a wednesday night and we were the first in the dining room. We each ordered a happy hour drink, 1 corona and 1 margarita, rocks with salt. Both were great. Our appetizer, ceviche camarones de sinoloa was fanatstic. It was accompanied by 2 kinds of salsa and chips. Very tasty. Then came our entrees. Carne Tampique?a for me (done medium rare) and Cochinita Pibil for him. Both came with black beans and rice, and both were delicious. The service was quick and attentive and our waitress Nicole was very sweet. I definitely recommend to anyone."
10907,46,4,1,12/6/2010,"Small cozy place, but big in flavor. One of my favorites mexican restaurants in the city. Actually, before visiting the restaurant, a few Mexicans recommended it to me, saying this is probably the most authentic and best mexican food I could have in Philly. They proved to be right. Friendly staff with good service. They have a small bar where you can wait to be seated (it can get busy on weekends)."
10908,46,5,1,11/15/2010,"This is definitely a small place, but with so much to offer! ˜Went there for a girls' night out dinner and it was delightful. ˜I don't know how I will ever have a margarita without chipotle ever again. ˜I started my meal with a lovely ceviche mixto, which I had my reservations about what with it being November and all. ˜However, it was delicious and came with some crackers, which I find lacking sometimes when ceviche is served at other restaurants. ˜For an entree I had the Mole Tradicional. ˜The mole was rich and flavorful, the portion size was hearty, and the chicken was cooked perfectly. ˜Not only that but it was served with plantains...yum. ˜No dessert for me that night but I wish I had room for it as it looked very appetizing!"
10909,46,4,1,11/15/2010,"Came here for dinner last night (Sunday night) with my family. There was only one server working the bar, the restaurant and the phone. She was visibly stressed but friendly. We started a marg, which was good and strong. We had the guac which was not remarkable but the pico de gallo was great.. The kids ordered quesadillas with corn tortillas, cheese and chicken. They were delicious, seriously, very good for such a basic appetizer. I had the chicken in the lava rock, which i asked to be spicy and holy mother was it hot. The thing is, it is was freaking hot and had a lot of flavor. Next time, maybe I won't be so cocky and get it ""somewhat spicy"". Hubby devoured his chicken enchillada as he said it was absolutely delicious. btw, when we were served dinner a second server arrived on the scene. She was stoned out of her mind. Not good news for our server as she needed the help. She looked like she could barely focus. It was funny to watch though. I guess it proves you get decent Mexican food on the East Coast. I would certainly return and hope next time, there is more than one server in the restaurant and if not, it isn't the stoned one."
8561,46,5,1,11/10/2010,"Celebrated a friend's 40th Bday here last night and had a wonderful time. It is a cozy little place. Read: there isn't much seating and the bar is only 5 stools, but they pack a lot of punch in this very small space. I do recommend reservations if you are going on the weekend, as it was pretty full on a Tuesday night! First off, the staff was incredibly accommodating. We had 2 folks show up unexpected and the staff asked the couple at the table next to us if they would mind moving to another table...doesn't hurt to ask right? They had no issue with this suggestion and we soon had our party seated. The couple that moved got some complimentary guacamole and chips from the staff, altho they declined our offer of Birthday cake... Our server was incredibly friendly, attentive, patient (with our large group) , and helpful. Nachos\Salsa out for munching, water glasses filled promptly, any issues dealt with promptly. We were seated near the door and it was a little cool...asked our server to close the outer door, which she did, then immediately went to the thermostat and turned up the heat! We had quite a variety of food at the table and everyone was pleased! I had the pork chops which were seasoned to perfection. ordering pork chops at a Mexican restaurant is a little outside of my comfort zone, but i was very pleased! I do not care for Seviche, but apparently they make a very good one here as our table ordered 4 of them and raved about the flavor. I also had the hand squeezed lemonade with a touch of cinnamon\clove. My girlfriend did NOT care for the additional flavor, but i found it tantalizing! We brought our own Birthday Cakes which the servers brought out after dinner. I was slightly disappointed as i had heard wonderful things about the tres leches cakes they have, but that will have to wait for another visit. I did try the Mexican hot chocolate which they make over the stove by melting dark chocolate bars into hot milk. This is also touched with a little Cinnamon on top which was a lovely addition. All in all, a wonderful night at Las Bugambilias and I highly recommend you checking them out!"
10910,46,3,1,8/30/2010,"Las Bugambilias is generally great food/drinks, great service and good prices. ˜We ate here when they first opened and have been coming back ever since. ˜If I had reviewed them previously they would have more stars however, given the last two times we have eaten here (in last two weeks) I am giving only 3. ˜ Mainly because there is a strong odor (almost sewage but could be pest control) smell evident when you walk in the door and a definite fly problem. ˜Not sure what it is but it is definitely not appetizing and on our most recent visit I was tempted to leave but we had out of town guests and they had arrived before us and were already seated. ˜ Our meals were good as they usually are. ˜Hopefully, they get the smell taken care of because for now, I am not inclined to return because of it. Also, they used to have this delicious walnut cake dessert that they took off the menu and it seems like the last view visits some of the others desserts are not available."

10912,46,4,1,7/26/2010,"I've been trying to find a yummy authentic Mexican restaurant in Philly. ˜The restaurant itself is colourful, cute, and very small. ˜ I was there for a late lunch, and there seemed to be only one woman working out on the restaurant floor. ˜ The food was good, but the service was a little slow. Yes there was only one woman working, but we were also the only diners as well... We started with the guacamole which was yummy, but tiny! ˜ The sangria pitcher, on the other hand, was huge. ˜Which made us happy. ˜I had the cochinita pibil, which I thought was flavorful and juicy. ˜My fellow diners had mole, enchiladas, and a steak dish.

10913,46,5,1,7/24/2010,"Lord oh lord, is the food good here. Great quesadillas, tacos, enchilladas, and everything else. Great drinks and good value for the quality.

10914,46,3,1,7/12/2010,"I was stoked to try this out last Friday night after reading the expert witness of numerous California-transplants testifying to the greatness of Las Bugambillas. Being a recent West Coast transplant myself, I put some stock into this testimony but came up a bit disappointed in Las Bugambillas. The setting and the vibe were right, as were the chips and the drink specials. But our entrees missed the mark. We ordered adventurously, though, and I would give Bugambillas another try as the large menu had a lot to offer from staples to more exotic fare. Pros -Setting - the place has a cute, homegrown decor that appears lived and thought out by someone with some real experience with Mexico - a much more authentic vibe than Philly's leading brand Mexican places where favor style over substance (read El Vez, Lolita). -Chips - awesome, hot and salty and not too abundant. It's easy to overload on chips, but Bugambilla's modest baskets offer a responsibly-sized sample. -Bebidas - happy hour til 7pm features good and fuerte $5 margaritas and $3 mexican beers including my favorites Bohemia, Negro Model and Pacifico. -Menu - vast and explorable ranging from everyday favorites like 'cheese enchiladas' to stuff you've never even heard of - pescado tikin xil. ˜ Cons Underwhelming Comida - things started off right with the fresh and tasty ceviche mixto but went a bit downhill after that. Ensalada Oaxaca sounded amazing, but was covered in too much, too-strong salad dressing tasting of molasses and tamarind - the ripe tomatoes and avocado in the greens were helpless against fire power of that magnitude. Entrees were the adequate but uninspired cochinita pebil - yucatan-style braised pork shoulder and a frankly bad camarones endiablados - which was shrimp in a sea of tomato sauce and cheese - almost like Italian shrimp parmesan."
10915,46,4,1,7/7/2010,"Sitting ˜outside of this place on a Saturday night is a great people watching exercise. ˜You can see a few locals, a lot of tourists and people from the Garden State just out and about on South St. ˜ Oh, and the food is good too. ˜I love the guacamole - it had more heat than most which was great. ˜We ordered a beef dish and a chicken dish, both of which were excellent. ˜The margaritas were pretty solid too. ˜And our waitress was just great."
10916,46,5,1,7/6/2010,"The skirt steak over a cheese-stuffed fried jalapeno pepper is to die for. As is the tamarind chicken. As are the mango margaritas, pitchers of sangria, etc. This is the cutest little restaurant in a less-hectic strip of South Street. Your search for great Mexican food in Philly stops here. Seriously amazing home-cooked goodness. Being a CA transplant, I miss my late-night Mexican food fixes, and Las Bugambilias is by no means that kind of restaurant, but they do elevate the flavors of traditional Mexican food to fine dining quality without making you feel like it's not great homey Mexican food anymore! Came back here for my Graduation dinner with 18 of my friends and family, and everyone LOVED everything. Pretty hard to please an entire group of people ranging from 3 yrs old to 86 yrs old, from CA, Texas, Florida, NJ, Vietnam, and the Philippines. And everyone left full, happy, and raving about the food. Not to mention they were great about accomodating such a large group at short notice. I had NO trouble getting a reservation and adding 5 people last minute during Graduation weekend. That's great service! Also, great great date spot!"
10917,46,4,1,7/5/2010,"She said: Yum. ˜We visited this restaurant on a quiet Monday evening, and we had the most amazing Mexican dinner -- probably one of the best I've ever had. ˜(For someone who's lived several years in CA, this is kind of a big statement.) The two especially memorable dishes were the seafood soup and the chicken dish with cactus (served in a pot made out of lava rock). ˜The seafood soup had generous amounts of seafood in a delicious, comforting broth. ˜The chicken was grilled and simmered in a delectable sauce, with melting cheese and cactus -- and it was memorably good, better than similar dishes served at other restaurants. ˜Its portion was generous, so you could take some home or share this entree with a friend. ˜My mouth is now watering. No complaints about their homemade tortillas, tortilla chips, and sides. ˜The waitress was sweet and very helpful, and she recommended trying desserts (they are homemade) next time -- if I weren't stuffed, I would have certainly tried some on the spot. ˜I can't wait to go back, have another yummy, filling meal, and leave a little room for dessert! He said: ˜I had a great time here. ˜We went on a nice quiet summer evening and were the only couple inside the restaurant (apparently everyone else enjoyed sweating outside). ˜I agree that the dinner was excellent. ˜The biggest highlights were the seafood soup and the lava rock dish (it may be called the molcajete pollo, but don't hold me to that). ˜Both were absolutely delicious, top notch Mexican. ˜The portion sizes were also very reasonable, we got filled up much quicker than we expected. ˜We also tried the spicy pineapple margarita, which was tasty but could have been a bit more spicy in my opinion. ˜Other stuff we tried was the Queso Chihuahua, which was tasty but ridiculously filling (it's basically a boat filled with cheese and cactus). ˜The one miss was the Chicken Mole. ˜It was all right, but a little more bitter and chocolaty than I would prefer. ˜All in all though, I'd highly recommend this place and will probably be back in the next couple of months."
10918,46,4,1,7/1/2010,"I had dinner at the restaurant and it was delicious. ˜The menu is creative and the decor is festive. ˜My brother and I shared the Sopes Veracruzanos as an appetizer ... very good! ˜We also ate the Camarones Rellenos (stuffed shrimp wrapped in bacon) and the Enchiladas with ground meat. ˜For dessert, we had two kinds of tres leches cake, vanilla and chocolate. ˜I've had better, but it was still good. ˜The chocolate version was a bit too sweet for me. ˜The food overall is a bit pricey, but it was a special occasion (my brother's birthday)."
10919,46,3,1,6/16/2010,"I wanted to give Las Bugambilias a 3 1/2 . . .but then I realized that that's what I gave El Rey . . . and I would take Las Bugambilias any day above El Rey. ˜Maybe I should lower my ranking of El Rey. ˜Or maybe instead of the half star, Yelp should ADD a star. ˜This might be my new campaign for Yelp, the addition of a star. Anyway, I went here with a group of 8 for dinner last night . . . which can often be a recipe for disaster, it was not. ˜The restaurant itself is quite cute, and especially adorable in light of its South Street location. ˜To start, they have a very nice cocktail selection, there's something for everyone. ˜ We started with the queso fundido with crab. ˜It was good, just good, not great, but a solid way to start the evening. ˜I had the enchiladas del mar . . . here is where I'm torn. ˜Did I actually really enjoy this, or do I just enjoy any food totally slathered with cheese? ˜The jury's still out. ˜ This was a very lovely dining experience for a group of 8, which is important. ˜I would recommend it to others too as it is more convenient than some of my favorite south philly mexican restaurants."
10920,46,4,1,6/8/2010,"I have been here with one, I have been here with a few! A GREAT place to go to order a pitcher of sangria and the mole sauce is to DIE for! cute little space with some eye catching ingredients (who knew -chocolate and turkey?) and very friendly staff. there is a little bar tucked in the corner, and I originally went there at the recommendation of a friend and shop owner close by the spot. You will be happy you tried this gem!"
10921,46,4,1,5/9/2010,"Las Buganbilias, Spanish for bougainvillea, is a Mexican restaurant in Old City with tasty food. The chips and salsa--both extremely fresh--were perfect, except that the portion was small and they charge for extras. I started with the poblano soup, which looked very appetizing, but lacked the boldness in flavor I was expecting; the predominant flavor in this soup was corn (which probably made up the base) and the poblano flavor was hidden. I enjoyed it nonetheless and would probably recommend it, even if I'm not jumping up and down to order it again. Next, I had the skirt steak, which was presented with a wonderful tomatillo sauce and stuffed jalapeno peppers. The steak was a tad chewy, but I appreciated the flavor and size of the dish."
10922,46,4,1,5/7/2010,"Hello Yelpers, good recommendation for a Mexican restaurant in Philly. ˜Thanks! :) ˜We had such a delicious meal there. ˜Tried and love their Pollo Tamarindo!"
10923,46,5,1,4/26/2010,totally agree with Shawn S. AMAZING dinner i had with a friend on Halloween :D i had 2 drinks: Diablo (the devil) and Vampiro (Vampire) becuase of the spirit of the holiday :D
7801,46,4,1,4/25/2010,"Yummm! Really fresh, authentic Mexican food and it's a bonus that the restaurant itself is well decorated and extremely friendly service. We just happened to be walking by and decided to stop in. No complaints - loved it!"
10924,46,5,1,4/18/2010,"I don't even know where to start. This is my favorite restaurant ever, I have dined here numerous times and have never had a bad experience. The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. The lime daiquiri and white sangria are amazing. For starters you can't go wrong with the queso chihuahua, it's melted cheese and chorizo, enough said. Also the tacos pastor are amazing. The crema frijoles and crema poblana soups have a real depth of flavor, very surprising. My favorite entrees are cochinita pibil (tender roasted pork with plantains) and carne tampiquena (skirt steak wrapped around a cheese filled jalapeno with a mole enchilada). Finish the meal with their cafe de olla and the churros with caramel sauce, it so unbelievable. This is the place to go for any occasion and to get amazing authentic Mexican food."
10925,46,4,1,3/3/2010,"Yes it is true that most gringos don't know true quality Mexican food. ˜I admit I was one of those gringos for years until I was born again via Mexican food in San Diego. This place in Philly is as close to real Mexican food as it gets. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for the tasteless, weak margaritas. Come on it's tequila. Bring it on!! However, the food is excellent. Their salsa is awesome. Everything is in house made and the food is not smothered in greasy cheddar cheese. Bravo!"
10926,46,4,1,1/26/2010,"I've always felt that Philly had a slight gap when it came to Mexican food. ˜Sure we have the big attractions (El Vez and Distrito) and nothing against either of them, but ˜sometimes you want a place that is a little more casual, more relaxed. ˜Las Bugambilias is totally that places. ˜ First, start with the drinks (definitely start with a drink). ˜I personally can't get enough of the pineapple chipotle margarita. ˜Its sweet and a little spicy. ˜My friend (who doesn't like anything spicy) didn't enjoy it--so a warning if you don't like spice. ˜She did really enjoy the traditional margarita, however. ˜ In our visits, we've gotten guacamole and queso as appetizers. ˜We were able to get vegetarian queso. ˜It was great, with really good fresh tortillas and a lovely oozy goodness. ˜The guacamole with chips and the salsas are amazing, some of the best I've ever had. ˜I like my guac a little chunky and LB satisfies. ˜We also ordered enchiladas (vegetarian and chicken) and were incredibly pleased with those as well. ˜ The dining room and service are great, if unfortunately small, meaning reservations on weekends and busy nights are a very good idea. ˜Love it and will definitely go back!"
10927,46,5,1,12/28/2009,"In one word. ˜AWESOME! ˜This may be the most amazing mexican food on the east coast. ˜Food is fresh, service is excellent, seating.. is challenging. ˜ we normally order the same thing. Cheese appetizer (with churizo or mushrooms both are decidant), ˜ Tortilla soup is good (the best i've had was a coyote crossing, but this is a close second. ˜ As for entrees, the enchiladas... WOW. SAVE room for dessert! ˜The Mexican coffee and Homemade Churros are to die for!"
10928,46,5,1,11/30/2009,"Years ago, the idea of a great Mexican restaurant in Center City was almost laughable. To extend that perception further, the typical restaurant-goer might almost never think of the storied culture's cuisine as worthy of especial regard. As of the last decade, we've been fortunate to be the benefactors of the arrival of at least three Mexican-inspired kitchens, so finely crafted and conceived, as to induce one to literally drool at the prospect of visiting them. Joining Las Cazuelas and Lolita at the top of the city's culinary treasures, Las Bugambilias is conveniently tucked into a modest slot alongside eastern South Street's fixtures, Paddywhack's and the South Street Diner. The space is cozy; read as: reservations highly recommended. Inside, festively arranged music lazily plays in the background, adding to the gentle stupor one settles into when partaking of the bar's more than generous mixtures. I couldn't resist the mojito, and despite its relative sweetness, I'll rate it among the best I've tried. And of course the food: to die for. My buddies and I stopped in before a ˜show at the TLA on a Sunday, which I believe may be why the gems they call entrees came to the table so quickly. I was tempted by the pulled pork with plaintain, and, as ordinary a dish as this may sound, the wonder meat was so mysteriously savory as to really make one ponder, how do they do it? The astounding pollo tamarindo that my NY pal inhaled with Hoover-like efficiency is a menu highlight and is simply not to be missed. Even the unassuming dollop of refried beans, served as a side with every main course, is so tasty that it's truly baffling how such seemingly simple foods can be handled with such sophistication. The portions are generous - bring your appetite. For what you get from the standpoint of taste, quality, and amount, the prices are very reasonable. If there's one restaurant to recommend above all in the QV/South Street area, I'd point to this one without a second's hesitation."
10929,46,4,1,11/22/2009,"It seems like I'm always obligated to separate my review between the food and the service. The food was great. Simply put. We had some tortilla chips with two different salsas, one was mild and one was spicy. Both were good. My fiance ordered the enfrijoladas. She normally doesn't like black beans, but she said the black bean sauce was delicious. I ordered the Pescado Tikin Xil/Yucateco, which was done perfectly. The shrimp and sauce on the fish was perfectly balanced. The side dish of rice was also great. Based solely on the food, we will be back. However..... The service was a different story. We were seated promptly. Our waitress came over and asked what we wanted, not ""Do you want something to drink?"". So, we ordered both drinks and food all at once. My beer was served to me quickly; however, my fiance's drink sat on the bar for literally 10 minutes. I had to flag down our waitress to retrieve her drink. After our food was delivered, it took our waitress another 10 to 15 minutes to come over to ask how our food was. It just seemed that she was trying to do too much, with waiting tables (maybe too many?), seating people, and clearing tables. Also to note, a family sitting next to us were seated by the time we got there and received their food after we were finished eating. Overall, we loved the food, didn't like the service, and am hoping next time we go the service will have improved."
10930,46,5,1,10/22/2009,"Love this place Ive been back to this place a few times, and each time are happy we go. If you like food with a kick and favor recommend trying this resturant. Even there nachos are homemade and every appetizer we have tried on the menu."
10931,46,5,1,10/11/2009,"Wonderful, authentic upscale Mexican!! the service and ambiance is great, the drinks are very reasonably priced, and the food is wonderful! This is truly a gem! You can find many authentic taqueria's in Philly (la lupe, veracruzano), and there are also a number of very nice upscale locations (Lolita, Tequilas, Xochitl), but this is the ONLY upscale AUTHENTIC Mexican. Las Bugambilias is wonderful. It is hard to find a favorite dish. There are multiple grouper dishes that are wonderful, the chicken is great, as is the mole and plantains. You will not be disappointed."
10932,46,4,1,9/25/2009,"My boyfriend and I decided their plantains and pork are part of our dream menu, along with a few favorites from other restaurants. Definately, definately get a dish with plantains and pork. Drinks were okay and apps were a little spicy, but I'm a wimp with spices. The place is very hard to pronounce, but a great Mexican spot, that's nicer than most authentic Mexican spots."
10933,46,4,1,9/8/2009,"Really enjoyed our meal here. The service was terrific, and it's adorable although crowded. The food, though we thought was just very good, not excellent - the 26 rating on Zagat's is insane."
10934,46,4,1,7/25/2009,This place does an excellent job at creating a mexican meal and cute atmosphere. ˜ We started with the ceviche mixto - It was without flaw. ˜It had the perfect amount of lime and the avocado stood out as being the best I've had in recent memory(not sure why that would be...maybe its just how they slice it into thin cubes). Their chips and salsa= Above Average We had the grouper veracruzana and enchiladas. ˜The enchiladas were good but the grouper was better. ˜I highly recommend this establishment.
10935,46,4,1,6/27/2009,"I moved to Philly from New Mexico two years ago and have been in search of good Mexican/Southwestern food since. While Las Bugambilias doesn't quite stand up to the food in Santa Fe, its as close a comparison as I've found and I give it my full support. Tortilla chips were ˜homeade and still warm when brought to the table. The pico was standard pico and the other salsa had a great smoky flavor with a little spice to boot. ˜Guacamole was also very tasty, but nothing too exciting. Nice use of onion and tomato, could use a bit more garlic in my opinion. Margaritas were pretty good, not great, as they were a bit tart for my liking. Not worth the standard $9 asking price, but a fair value at the $6 happy hour rate. Main course was great. I went with the mole enchiladas and they managed to satisfy my southwestern craving that's been sitting my belly for nearly two years now. The lady-friend got the regular chicken mole dish (we were both craving mole) and it was also up to task, but I can't vouch for any dishes outside of the mole sphere. Dessert was some sort of banana cake. It was good (for banana cake) but I generally don't go for dessert unless it has chocolate somewhere in the mix, which this did not. However, the miss' wanted to try it, and I reluctantly obliged her desire. Overall an excellent experience. I'm stingy with the five stars, and this place received brief consideration, but didn't quite make the cut."
10103,46,5,1,6/23/2009,"WOW. My partner John and I have dined at Las Bugambilias several times - and not once have we been disappointed! It began upon returning from a trip - we decided to not go to the regular haunts - but instead walk around a bit and see if there was anything new to try - - one of the advantages of living in the Society Hill / South Street region is the wealth of dining options available. As we walked down 2nd Street, we came to South and saw the most unique metal sculpture on the sidewalk - a female skeleton was adorned in colorful garb and standing outside this restaurant, just begging us to enter. So we did. The restaurant is small - seats about 30 total - and honestly that allows you to truly envelop yourself in authentic Mexican food and culture; from the service to the music to the aromas - it's a great dining experience. As chef and owner, Carlos Molina offers high quality, freshly prepared, Mexican food from three different regions in Mexico. Before opening this spot - Carlos was the chef for the highly-regarded Tequilia's over on 16th street. His attention to detail shows through with every entree. Currently, John's favorite dish is the Camarones Rellenos; five shrimp stuffed with cheese, pumpkin blossoms, zucchini, and corn wrapped with bacon served with a chipotle sauce accompanied with rice, corn, lettuce and tomatoes. The bite of the chipotle sauce is softened by the hint of pumpkin blossoms. A wonderful dish. My current fave is the Carne Tampique?a; a skirt steak wrapped around a jalape?o pepper filled with Chihuahua cheese covered with coriander sauce and served with a mole enchilida, rice, beans and guacamole. No matter what we try as entrees - we always start our dining experience with a fresh order of guacamole (served within a molcajete) as well as an order of Queso Chihuahua; melted Chihuahua cheese and crumbled chorizo (sausage) or huitacoche, sliced peppers and onions. Served hot, this dish is PERFECT with the heated chips and tortilla that comes along. BTW - if you (or your dining companion) go to celebrate a birthday - make mention. Not only will you get served a complimentary slice of Pastel de Tres Leches Trifle (which is a traditional three milk cake soaked in Amaretto layered in a trifle with chocolate or berry marlow, fresh homemade whipped cream and seasonal fruit) - but the restaurant comes to a halt as everyone - including the kitchen staff and chef Carlos - come out to sing the traditional Mexican birthday song, Las Mananitas. Quite fun (and yes, it happened to me back in June)!! Since they do not take reservations, I suggest making your first visit on a weeknight - where you can experience the food and atmosphere at a more casual pace. Weekends have been known to be a tad hectic. All in all, from my perspective, a dining experience at Las Bugambilias ... bon­simo!!"
10936,46,4,1,5/30/2009,"Cute, tiny little space filled with lots of flavor! Portion sizes are completely appropriate and appetizers are almost not necessary. ˜The margaritas are stunning -- and make sure you have a reservation!!!!! ˜We did, and we walked right in at 8pm on a saturday night with our table waiting for us!!! Loved it and would recommend it -- and would totally go back."
10937,46,5,1,3/30/2009,"One of the most authentic mexican places in the city. ˜I get take out lunch from them several times a week. The chicken soup is to die for, and the enfrijolados are amazing."
10938,46,5,1,2/21/2009,"I went to Las Bugambilias on Valentine's Day with a gaggle of girls. We almost had to wait for our reserved table, but then were seated within minutes. It was a special meal of 4 courses - and you had a $35 menu or a $55 menu to make choices from. I can't remember all that I had, but the free margarita that came with the meal helped to erase my memory. To keep it short, I was hoping for a dish with some plantains (which are listed on the regular menu), but I totally forgot about that wish when I ate what was placed before me. Excellent tortilla soup, excellent enchiladas, excellent everything. I will definitely go here again! The service was fantastic, the atmosphere was great (great decor), and I came away very satisfied. I look forward to going back for some sangria and one of those dishes containing plantains! Plantains! This is authentic Mexican!"
10939,46,4,1,2/17/2009,"My wife and I went on Valentine's Day. ˜We had an 8:30 reservation. ˜We showed up at 8:15 and I immediately got a bad vibe; like a nice little restaurant was being pushed beyond its limits. ˜It just seemed frantic. ˜But we managed to snag some seats at the bar and ordered a round of margaritas (very good, but while their website listed a variety of specialty 'ritas with specific tequilas, we were just asked ""salt or no salt'). We were seated at 8:45, not bad. ˜They were only doing two special tasting menus which we weren't aware of going in. ˜No big deal. ˜And the cheaper option ($35 per person) was gone, only the $55 option left. ˜Again, not a big deal. ˜Despite all these little hiccups going in, the service was excellent and the food was very good (I had a spicy seafood soup and a steak which was nicely seasoned and smothered in sun-dried tomatoes). ˜And while the tables were way too close together (we had to ask the couple next to us to push their table over next to their other neighbors in order for my wife to get up), we would definitely go back again. ˜Just under less stressful circumstances next time."
10940,46,4,1,7/12/2008,"If I was a bigger Mexican food fan this could potentially be five stars. I dont do spicy, so I am limited here, but I loved what I ate. It was some sort of delicious and non-spicy fresh fish dish with shrimp and the best fried plantains I ever had. The tortilla chips were also the best I've ever had, even though the salsa was too spicy for me. I love the art on the walls, photographs of old Latino movie stars, the plates, everything about it's quaintness and warmth. It is definitely a crowded little space, so the volume level can be a minus, unless you are drunk and want to be really loud yourself - which isn't too hard with the Mexican beers (Soles? My new favorite). Service is nice, everything was lovely and delish. Kisses to the Bugambilias, whatever they are!"
8225,46,4,1,7/6/2008,"Due to some of the previous Tex Mex restaurant outings that I've had recently I've been determined to find some grand authentic Mexican Post haste. So when a friend who enjoys the cuisine came out for the fireworks I decided to try here on a whim. And in a lot of ways Las Bugambilias definitely lived up to my expectations. It's a lot more pricier than the other traditional Mexican restaurants you'll find in Philly. But the extra $ goes towards authentic decor, incredible food presentation, and fresh ingredients. So it evens out by my book. our table instantly had complimentary chips bought out to us that were nice and warm. We were also hooked up with two kinds of salsa - garden fresh, and spicy chipolte. probably the best chips that I've had. And the Veggie Enchiladas that I picked up were incredible! Zucchini, spinach, peppers, onions, and carrots rolled in wheat tortilla and smothered in melted chihuahua cheese. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them! And while I went teetotal, I definitely made note of awesome tequilia flights that they have Tuesday-Thursday during the hour of happiness. definitely something I'm going to have to try out. Due it priceness Las Bugambilias definitely isn't a place that I'll be going to on a regular basis when I have a craving for Mexican. But if I ever need to impress someone it's perfect!"
8261,46,5,1,2/21/2008,"Why are we holding out on the five stars people? Too good for them now? As I live on the cusp of Little Mexico/Vietnam/Pho-town over on Washington Ave., it would be remiss for you to think I haven't had my fare share of authentic (and sometimes down-right scary) Mexican dishes. And, if I do say so myself, I think I have a pretty good handle on and pretty solid list of the best Mexican in Philadelphia (Mexican food that is. Sorry, Jose.) Top No. 1 spot is La Jarocha. No. 2 is La Lupe and No. 3 is Taqueria Verecruzana. Fortunately for me, these are all in a five-block radius. I took a trip to this new South Street joint (both adjectives lend themselves to a low expectation) just to see if maybe they couldn't disappoint. The setting is small, certainly, and they are trying to be more of an upscale dining date destination, so don't expect an ""authentic"" feel (read: alley entrance and neon lights). But the food I ordered was fabulous - absolutely delicious. Again, the plates are presented and prepared more elegantly (don't worry, the prices are palatable). And so don't expect too much of those traditional sauce sides (that weird green one and the deathly red one) you'll get at authentic restaurants with a free basket of chips. But the mole sauces was absolutely divine and multi-layered with flavors. The bean soup was creamy and perfect! (I could have downed bowls of it's gorgeous light-brown magic). Oh, and the servers outfits are perfectly pressed and very cool; the servers couldn't be kinder. I hope that Las Bugambilias (the name of a flower) proves the South Street curse wrong and stays around for awhile. Because, you know, sometimes I like to eat my Mexican in a safe place."
10941,46,3,1,12/11/2007,"I look at this place and it's just slightly below the threshold of ""over the top"". I'm not sure why certain venues serving ethnic foods find the need to go overboard into cliche like levels of decor. I'm glad they pushed they envelope but then had a little restraint. Regardless though, I think the Mexican decor movement has been tired for 20 years and actually brings the experience down for casual diners. Why not go modern ala their counterparts 100 miles NE (Pampano, Rosa). Also there's a difference between ""good"" domestic Mexican cuisine and ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine. If a place like this was serving ""authentic"" regional Mexican then most people in the Philly area would be upset at the spice, dishes they're unaccustomed to, and that ""mole"" is not the ""mole"" they've been having. See Mexico City for authentic cuisine (or Oaxaca region)."
10942,46,4,1,12/7/2007,"YES! ˜This authentic mexican restaurant sprouted up in our neighborhood all but two months ago...and I'm elated! ˜I'm always craving good mexican food in Philly and we happily surprised to find and enjoy this place. ˜A Los Catrines Tequila's spin-off, this seems to have a more low-key ""taqueria"" take on Mexican food. Las Bugambilias is located right next to South Street Diner and offers a warm, intimate setting. ˜The seating is somewhat crowded, but it actually had a good effect: our neighboring party gave us recommendations for the special appetizer of mushroom and cheeses quesadillas and the skirt steak entree. ˜It's certainly close quarters, but I'm glad they have so many tables packed in there, as we were seated immediately on a Friday night! ˜ The ambiance allows for a friendly encounter among all. ˜The staff are very attentive and know the menu well. ˜I had the three chicken enchiladas con mole, which was hearty and filling. ˜The complimentary chips and two salsas are authentic and delicious. ˜I definitely will return to try some of their specialty cocktail drinks, chocolate tres leches cake, and the tortilla soup. ˜The menu has a selection of seafood, pork, beef and chicken dishes and offers detailed explanations of each entree. ˜Definitely get the guacamole! As far as service goes: I happened to forget a personal belonging behind after leaving and the bartender caught up with me 2 blocks away to return it to me on a cold winter night without his coat! ˜I'm very impressed! ˜Las Bugambilias did not disappoint. ˜I intend to return again and again.

10943,46,5,1,10/11/2007,"I was in town for a wedding, and my friend took me to the grand opening of Las Bugumbilias (which for full disclosure purposes is run by her niece). Oh my god, do they know how to cook! Really creative, complex flavors. No relation to tex-mex, think much more subtle combinations of flavors and textures. It was hands down the best mexican food I have ever had. I had a seafood soup which was full of flavor and and great and my friend had the cream of carrot soup which was also heavenly. I had salmon as my main dish, which came with a tomato salsa and rice, which was also perfectly cooked and moist and full of flavor. The atmosphere is really cute. Tables and dishes from Mexico, and the cutest salt shakers you will ever see. Vegetarian options are not so good, but they say they will whip something up if you ask. Definitely, definitely, definitely worth going out of your way for. Josh"
10944,47,5,1,5/1/2014,"Large comfortable banquet hall with huge dance floor and traditional hot buffet menu. Manager Tommy is very service-oriented. No request is too much trouble.

10947,48,2,0,5/12/2014,Ordered Mother's day special meal with $35. I chewed on two finger nail size thick plastic shards with very sharp edges. My mouth hurt badly. The dinning room was already noisy with many guests that night . The hand dryer in the Men's room was so loud.

The food was great. ˜I've traveled many times over many years to Thailand and other countries in Southeast Asia, and have a taste for the regional cuisine - especially the aromas and unusual flavors - though not necessarily for the unquenchable fire. ˜ That said, Ricky's kept the things I love about Thai food, the spices, a gifted use of ingredients like coconut milk and lemon grass, but were blissfully light on the painful fire you often get with Thai food. ˜(You can choose a high level of fire if you like - you're in control). We had the Panang Curry with chicken, the Pad Thai with Shrimp, a Warm Salad dish that had minced pork in a delicious lemon-grass marinade, a duck appetizer and egg rolls. The only thing that was just OK were the egg-rolls, which were OK but did not rise up to the level of the 4 other dishes. But those 4 other dishes were truly exceptional. The decor and food presentation was lovely, and the service was charming. ˜ I guess others on this board had experienced otherwise, but in addition to the regular wait-staff, I thought the owner, Ricky, himself was also very charming. ˜Service was friendly, helpful, and efficient without feeling rushed. Given a small group of 3, we had a nicely varied array of dishes, left the table fully satisfied, and spent exactly $21 a person, at DINNER time. ˜ That's a rare achievement in this area, especially for this kind of food experience and pleasant decor. You could spend more if you want at Ricky's, but the curries, warm salads and noodle dishes are all very reasonable, and so if you base your meal around these, it will be very light on your wallet. ˜They have other higher end dishes too - a great selection for any Thai food lover. As a Montgomery resident I'll be bringing family and friends often."
10950,48,5,0,5/1/2014,"I have read all of the other reviews about this Thai place in Skillman and i can't see why there are any negative reviews. The interior is very nice and the pre dinner small salad plate is fresh and nothing is pre-cut or precooked like in other Thai places. Everything is fresh made from scratch. The ingredients in my Pad Thai where just good and plenty. I had six shrimp and for a lunch box that is sufficient also considering the price at $8.95. Service is good and my only comment is that when a restaurant has table cloth they also should have cloth napkins or thicker napkins than the one they use. But it is a affordable lunch price or pay more and have a better napkin, I go for the food quality. I will certainly will come back to this place."
10951,48,4,1,1/7/2015,"oh ricky you're so thai you're so thai you blow my... tastebuds? ...ok, so i may not be as hilariously witty as i think i am... but ricky's thai is pretty great, so go eat there. i recently got hooked on thai kitchen III in hillsborough (which has recently also been re-named 'ricky's thai' due to management changes), and when i heard that the owners were the same, i knew i had to check out the skillman location. the food is just as great, and this one's a closer ride- so yay. like many other fantastic restaurants in the area, ricky's thai is tucked into one of the small strip malls off of rt. 206 (across from the shoprite shopping center). it's easy to miss... but don't. the interior is nicely decorated and dimly lit, creating a classy-casual environment- i saw everything from jeans and tees to ties and blazers here. dinner hours get pretty busy, so you might want to make a reservation unless you're willing to risk waiting a bit, food is great .really great. some standouts: - red curry! it was loaded with meat (we chose beef, though shrimp, chicken, and veg options are available) and veg, and was the perfect level of spice for me (you can order spice level 1 through 5... i went with 2 because i'm a sissy and it still made me tear up). if you're sharing the curry, make sure to order an extra side of rice- the portions they serve you are a bit small. - pad that! yes, the staple pad thai... get it! we went with chicken, and the dish was packed with it, along with tofu, sprouts, etc. it's a delicious, huge portion for a small price- definite win. i only wish it was a little less dry and had some peanuts for crunch. - chef's special chicken! what a dish... chicken over a green curry sauce with avocado and veg and deliciousness, served with a side of rice. beautifully presented and super yummy... the green curry flavor was delish. service is attentive and friendly- even on a busy evening, we weren't rushed to choose our dishes, decide on dessert, or pay the bill. mucho appreciated. bonus: BYOB :)"
10952,48,2,1,1/1/2015,"I tend to order the same thing each time, Panang Curry with Chicken. ˜The last three times I have ordered take away, I have gotten mostly broth with a few vegetables and slices of chicken. ˜What I am getting is soup and rice, not Panang Curry with Chicken. Over the holidays I was in Omaha NE and ordered the same at a local Thai restaurant there and was shocked at how much white breast chicken was in the dish and it was wonderful. ˜I'm not sure why Ricky's cut back on their ingredients but now I must find another Thai restaurant."
10953,48,4,1,12/24/2014,"Hands down, the best Thai food I've tried in NJ so far...and I've kissed a lot of Thai restaurant frogs around NJ as I've tried to find this prince. The best part: it's relatively close and conveniently located on 206, across the street from ShopRite and Montgomery Cinemas. Food: Perfect level of heat. Nuanced, authentic flavors and lots of fresh vegetables, even in the lunch specials. I'm partial to their curries, which so far have all been fantastic. Everything tastes delicious! Venue: Surprisingly nice with a cozy feel even though it's in a strip mall. Upscale decor. Great ambiance. It's a popular spot for office and end-of-year holiday lunches. You could also bring a date here. Service: Efficient and pleasant despite having a near full house whenever I've been there. Impressive! Prices: Very reasonable."
10954,48,1,1,12/21/2014,"Disclaimer: This review may be unfair. But I am emotionally compromised right now. This is not directly a ricky's thai montgomery review. My FAVORITE thai food spot thai kitchen III in hillsborough was bought by a ricky's thai. Now I gave it a shot because hell how much could it change? But based on my regular orders the thai curries things have gone to COMPLETE SH*T. The rice is now hard almost like it's really old. The vegetables were the texture of baby food all mushy. Even the broccoli. (How is that even possible?) Don't even get me started on the taste of the coconut curry sauce. Before it was complex had spicy, salty, savory, and a tiny bit of sweetness. Now it's just spicy and lacking flavor. If I could ask the owners of the previous thai kitchen III to come back I would. Because ricky's thai in hillsborough is just plain Turrible (Hopefully there are a few basketball fans who get the reference)"
10955,48,5,1,11/23/2014,We enjoyed our first dining experience there. The food is healthy & affordable and served ˜by helpful friendly staff. We shall return!
10956,48,4,1,11/21/2014,Consistently fresh tasty dishes that come with a complimentary salad w/a peanut sauce dressing. ˜ I love the Mee Siam dish - something that you don't normally see at a thai restaurant. ˜Owner is always on site overlooking everything. ˜The only thing I find is that the spice level is not always what you ask for. ˜They either make it to the level you want or do not add any spice.
10957,48,5,1,11/11/2014,"I've been hoping for a great Thai place in Montgomery, and it looks like it arrived. I visited for lunch, somewhat wary based on some of the other reviews, but was pleasantly surprised to find none of the negatives mentioned. The place was clean, the decor was modern, comfortable and pleasing, and the food was excellent. The flavors were crisp, spice was exactly what you'd expect for the given ""heat level"", and service was prompt. I would always try to go to Hillsborough for TK3 when craving Thai, since I'm not impressed with the Princeton or Hopewell offerings, however, I think the food here was on par if not better than TK3. For those looking for Thai in the area, I would imagine TK3 would be on your list, and the best I can do is to compare. The appetizer salad was slightly less crisp than TK3, the thai iced tea felt a smidge watered down, but the main dish topped it all. The yellow curry with shrimp was superb; flavorful, bold, with a pan seared/grilled hint of something that I thought made the dish. It had just the right amount of veggies, shrimp and sauce. Although technically the two minor deductions should warrant a 4 star rating normally, the prompt service, excellent decor, and of course the above par main dish, won it a 5. I'll return and update after the second visit."
10958,48,4,1,11/4/2014,i guess it's pretty good.
10959,48,4,1,10/15/2014,"Went here for dinner on a Friday night, really nice set up, crowded but not overly so. Had the cold noodles & thai egg rolls for a starter. Cold noodles were excellent. I had the yellow curry with coconut milk for dinner and dinner which was excellent. Generous portions, brought some home. Waitress was prompt and attentive, answered questions easily. Overall a great dinner and lunch spot!"
10960,48,2,1,10/15/2014,"I was there on a Monday at 11:45, we both ordered chicken dishes one being Pad Thai. The food came out in 5 minutes tops. The chicken was clearly reheated, gross reheated like microwaved with that fishy taste. They had only been opened for 45 minutes so either it was from the night prior or they make it all first thing so they can reheat. The vegetables were fine, but I couldn't get past the chicken."
10961,48,4,1,9/28/2014,"Giving it 4 stars but it's really 3.5 for the food, or server pushed it to a 4. She was excellent. Explained the dishes, asked what we like and made additional recommendations and was patient. Not sure if this will make our rotation, but it was nice."
10962,48,2,1,9/28/2014,"The food was average, the meat did not taste very fresh. The service is terrible. We walked in early on a weekend to beat the rush and the lady who greeted us was so rude. We felt like we were imposing and they were doing us a favor by serving us. Will not be returning!"
10963,48,5,1,9/24/2014,Absolutely fantastic clean Thai food. I wasn't a huge fan of their version of Pad Thai but it was still delicious. The yellow curry and the mee siam were both out of this world. The decor is beautiful. One waiter dropped a bowl of rice while serving a big table and it was cleaned up before you could blink. Overall wonderful place
10964,48,5,1,9/20/2014,Without question the best and freshest Thai for many miles around. Great staff and FRIENDLY owner.
10714,48,5,1,9/18/2014,"Green curry with coconut milk chicken and veg was sooo good! My husband's Pad Thai was delicious, too. Service was prompt and attentive. Decor cool and quiet. Prices so reasonable. At 12:23pm Thursday almost every table is full. This is our new Thai place. Love it!"
10965,48,5,1,9/12/2014,"Delicious food, friendly service and an overall nice place to eat in this town! It's a great addition!"
10966,48,4,1,8/30/2014,"Food - ˜was delicious, flavorful, and plentiful. I had the classic Pad Thai, which was excellent. They had a nice selection of specials as well. Atmosphere - was comfortable and very nicely decorated in a clean, modern style with elements of Thai throughout. Service - was average and got the job done. It is great to see a restaurant like this opening in Montgomery!"
10967,48,1,1,8/8/2014,"Food was ok. A little bit too salty. And price is more expensive compare with other Thai restaurants nearby. The waiter was rude. When we were talking to him asking to have a box ˜to pack our food, he just walked away in the middle of our question without explaining anything. Few min later, he walked back asking us what do we need. Can't believe such service can survive in this area."
10968,48,1,1,8/8/2014,"Food was too salty. waitress brought wrong dish. We ordered 65 but they brought 66, and blamed on us not pointing the right one. Also, they refused to change our dish. Owner is very rude and food become very salty and overcooked compared with other Thai food around this area. I wouldn't give it a star at all."
10969,48,4,1,8/2/2014,"We have been to Ricky's a many time over the past 4 months. ˜Everything we order is great, kids like the food also. ˜We have done take out a couple of time and doesn't disappoint. ˜Highly recommend for anyone looking for a good meal in a quaint local spot."
10970,48,5,1,7/28/2014,"I went to Ricky's Thai for lunch and loved it! You get a complimentary salad with your meal. The peanut dressing was really tasty. I ordered the roti pancake for an appetizer and could have literally just drank the sauce from the bowl minus the pancake. My husband got the seafood soup, number 5 spicy and finished every drop. Overall we had a great meal with excellent service. Prices are reasonable and nice decor as well. Happy there is good Thai in Montgomery! I will be back"
10971,48,4,1,6/24/2014,"would have given Ricky's 5 stars but the staff needs work. ˜the food is outstanding and the atmosphere is very nice and a great place to go on a date or with a group of friends. ˜However, our waiter was not very good. ˜He did not explain anything, especially how the spices work. ˜He barely checked on us. ˜Luckily others picked up his slack. ˜I will be back."
10972,48,4,1,6/23/2014,Food: Delicious. I don't like fish but we ordered the tilapia with eggplant. It was fantastic. Also tried a coconut chicken soup which was surprisingly delicious. Pad Thailand of course excellent. Overall very pleased with food. Ambiance: Very nice interior. I would take a date here or family/friend. Service: Service was quick but a little on the rude side. We did get there at 9:20 when they closed at 9:30 though. We ordered fast but understandably the waitress was annoyed. It didn't take away from enjoying the food but made it awkward. Normally I would not have sat down in a restaurant that close to closing(worked in food service) but we did anyway. Better service would have given it the 5th star. Overall: I will return. Just earlier!
10973,48,3,1,6/7/2014,"Ambiance: Classy decor (more so than most Thai restaurants in this price range), extremely clean bathrooms Service: Others have complained about this, but ours was very fast - we had entrees within 15 minutes of sitting down. ˜We did not encounter the owner (this was dinnertime on a Monday evening) Food: I went with a family group and everyone liked what they got, ranging from pad thai and drunken noodle to beef cooked with fresh ginger and vegetables. ˜Prices are slightly higher than most local Thai spots, perhaps to reflect the fancier decor. ˜I saw several groups BYOB and they didn't seem to charge corkage fees. Overall I would have given 4 stars except for 2 things: 1) When we got the bill, we were charged for 4 Thai iced teas when we had ordered only 3 (and there were very obviously only 3 cups on the table). ˜They corrected this quickly, but it was a sloppy mistake. 2) I found a hair in my entree, and it definitely wasn't mine since it was UNDER some of the noodles. ˜Personally I didn't care, but again, it was something that shouldn't have happened."
10974,48,1,1,5/30/2014,"Food is good, but not enough to put up with the fact that the owner is incredibly rude. ˜Be careful you don't visit him when he is busy, god help you if you try to interrupt him while he is on the phone...hire a darn person to answer your phone if you can't greet you customers! Because the initial traffic is strong he thinks he can treat customers with disdain. ˜Hope he learns that this tactic will have customers not returning. ˜I will not be."
10975,48,1,1,5/30/2014,"RICKY IS RUDE AND DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO RUN HIS BUSINESS The food here was great on our first visit. On our second visit we never got to try it because the rude and arrogant Ricky shooed us away - literally. When we walked in at 6.40pm we were told by Ricky that there would be no table till 8pm. So we decided to order takeout while others who walked in at the same time as us, chose to leave. While we were waiting we saw another couple just walk in and get seated immediately, without a reservation. When we inquired about that, we were told by Ricky that he cannot predict if people leave the restaurant early and since we had decided to order take out, we could not be served the food at a table, even if one became available. He was extremely rude. When we protested and said we'd like to cancel the order, he used his hands to shoo us away. I have no interest in giving my money to such a rude and unprofessional business owner and I can't even imagine how he must treat his staff, if his treats his customers this way."
10976,48,5,1,5/20/2014,Beautiful and clean restaurant. The service was amazing. I chose the bbq shrimp special and loved it. If we are ever in the area again I would absolutely come back!
10977,48,2,1,4/30/2014,"Lovely decor Dining Music I liked ( no bass, not loud) Greeted with welcoming smile Awful quality of food. Don't see how they will last. Pad Thai too oily, poor flavor, three broccoli florets (so firm my fork needed force), 3 baby corn and 1 piece box Choy with some tofu. Vegetable salad appetizer: be sure to say dressing on the side as my dish came with more dressing than salad and because ˜dressing was thick ( corn starch?) it really was not appetizing at all. I left most behind and gently told the woman that I was done but to tell the kitchen .... ˜And like another reviewer, I too was basically blamed! ˜I was told to ask for less next time! There will not be a next time."
10978,48,3,1,4/25/2014,While the food is good the service was horrible They blamed us for ordering a satay which took 45 minutes for the delay They said we wanted a bigger portion for our second appetizer for more delay but they never increased the size Then of course they rushed into the main courses The food was not hot and we needed to ask for more rice The waiter and owner were clueless why we were upset that our meal took 2 hours while other tables were served in half the time Will head back to Thai Kitchen 3
10979,48,4,1,4/24/2014,"Ricky's Thai is a new restaurant for Skillman, but in reality it probably won't ""surprise"" too many locals, because the same owners run Thai Kitchen III in Hillsborough. That is a good thing. Some of the same friendly faces and even closer to home! Woohoo! The interior decor here is very nice, almost upscale, and certainly a step above the typical strip mall Asian place. So far only had lunch here but the quality and service is what I have come to expect from the owners of Thai Kitchen. The Tom Kha Gai soup was excellent and had the perfect level of spiciness. The bowl was enough to share as a lunch appetizer. I had chicken pad thai, again perfectly cooked, and delicious with nice crispy bean sprouts and just the right amount of peanuts. My only gripe is that I would have liked a little more chicken in it and a little less tofu. My date had broad noodles with shrimp, and that was really good as well -- again just the right amount of spice, and typical for Thai -- fragrant and enticing flavors. In summary, for those in the Princeton/Montgomery Twp area who'd like great Thai food at reasonable prices with low hassle parking, this is your spot. It's about 1/4 mile north of the Tigers Tale, right on 206."
10980,48,4,1,4/5/2014,"Very tasty, great menu options, nice decor. ˜Food came out super fast but, service was not the most attentive. ˜Appetizers & entrees came out all at once. ˜Vegetarian ""duck"" was phenom & Peking duck was also reported to be excellent. ˜Will definetely be back. ˜BYOB"
10981,48,5,1,4/2/2014,Big selection of Thai dishes. So far I have been happy with all dishes. Excellent service. Nice addition to the area.
10982,48,1,1,4/1/2014,"If I could give this place no stars I would. Got takeout here a week ago, and guess what the meat wasn't cooked. So i basically removed all the uncooked meat pieces and had a vegetarian dish, because you know, I would like to be healthy than eat raw meat. Since it was my lunchtime, its not like I could return the food or complain about it. I was stuck with it because I have a one hour lunch break. If possible, go to Thai Kitchen. This place looks nice, but if they are too lazy to cook their food properly, then they don't deserve business. Pretty sad esp since there aren't any Thai restaurants in the skillman area."
10983,48,5,1,3/27/2014,"I have been eager to try this place and I must say I was not disappointed. ˜I thought the service was impeccable, the Decor fresh, new and very cosy and everything I ordered was exactly what I ordered. I thought I would see how they did when u ordered different levels of spice and I must say they hit every mark. Great job, my husband and I will be regulars for sure. ˜Thx Kess for the great service"
10984,48,4,1,3/25/2014,"One of the better Thai restaurants in the area. ˜Decor is lovely, and the service was attentive and friendly. The vegetarian duck jay curry was delicious, as was the pad thai. ˜The Tom Yum Khoong soup had the perfect combination of salty sour and spicy. ˜While the prices are maybe a dollar or two per item more expensive than other area restaurants, ˜the servings are large enough to share. ˜The sticky rice with mango was some of the best I've had. ˜This place is comparable to Aroma Thai and is a welcome addition to the area! ˜Looking forward to going back to try more dishes."
10985,48,2,1,3/22/2014,"Ok , yes the decor is very nice . It should be , it just opened...however the tables are pretty close together which detracts from the experience a little. The other reviewer who said this was authentic has obviously not been to Thailand or maybe only to an American tourist hotel. While the food was not bad , in general it is overly sweetened and missing the balance of salty sweet and heat that local Thai food needs- but points for fresh garnishes and good presentation . Specifically our ""mussaman""curry was watery and no different to any average red curry.the potatoes were firm and the beef was obviously added after the order was placed , thin slices tough and chewy , not slowly cooked in chunks until it falls apart richly as it is preferably made. The special fish with eggplant was very good , tending to sweet again but a much better dish. We also had chicken larb and crispy duck both of which were ok if again very sweet. The dressings were good but larb was definitely missing the lime juice needed and no lime was served with it . Attempts to get a waitress before weed finished eating were not fruitful. Minor quibble, we had asked about rice with the dishes and waitress pointed us to choice of white brown or coconut in the menu. Maybe we had not been clear or she misunderstood but we ended up with an excess of rice as she also bought 2good serves of rice with the meal. When we mentioned that she had implied rice didn't come with the ordered food she said she thought we wanted more rice - hmmm . No offer to return the extra bowl of rice . Overall , will try a few more dishes but disappointed yet again in the asian food offerings ˜near Princeton"
10986,48,5,1,3/20/2014,"I visited Ricky's Thai LITERALLY the day they opened. ˜FINALLY a Thai place close enough to work that is actually delicious. ˜I ordered the Pad See Ew and it did not disappoint. ˜The noodles were thick and chewy, and the beef tasted like it had been grilled to perfection. ˜It wasn't' overrun with sauce, but wasn't dry either. ˜The decor inside this place is lovely and the person who helped me was very nice. ˜I will definitely be back!"
10987,48,5,1,3/18/2014,The decor in this restaurant is amazing! ˜Everything I ate are very authentic. ˜The atmosphere are warmth and welcoming. ˜ The service was excellent and we all know when the service is great. The food will definitely tasted great. I will definitely be back here again and again and again.
10988,48,5,1,3/15/2014,"Finally a good Thai restaurant in Princeton area. ˜ Came here 3 days after it opened. ˜Ambiance is a modern and clean look, which I liked. ˜Service we had was decent. ˜I felt the Thai food we had was on par with Thai Kitchen."
10989,1356,1,0,7/14/2014,"This place is probably a prime example of what happens when you open up a business w/out competition. The first time I went to this restaurant was the day it opened. This was located in Langhorne-- and it was probably the only time I found them to be good. I went there again (before they closed and moved), the food was nothing like the first time. Some items were still good though so not a complete loss. After they closed and moved else where, I went again to this new location and food was slightly more awful with even less items good this time. Finally I went to their THIRD location today (and there's something's to be said about a place when it keeps closing and moving somewhere else) and the food is all in all awful. And I don't mean to exxagerrate but good Lord.. If I burnt my money, I probably would be more satisfied than eating this monstrosity in the name of food. Rice is w/out-- WITHOUT, NOT with little, salt. Salad with everything mushed in and soggy. Microwaved bread which is at least a day old... I'm pretty sure I will not be going to their fourth location."
10990,1356,2,0,5/10/2014,"After reading the reviews, we were really looking forward to trying the food. ˜Ordered a variety of items for take out, and was horribly disappointed. ˜A truly epic fail. ˜The hummus was good. ˜The lamb tikka kabob was dreadful, consisting of 6 quarter-sized pieces of dry, ˜tough lamb, a huge amount of ""Persian rice"", and a chunk of stale bread. ˜The salad was good. ˜The gyro platter had okay flavor, but again, the meat was overcooked...the flavor came mostly from the sauces. ˜The beef kofta was also dry, which is remarkable given it was drenched in sauce. ˜The baklava was obviously a supermarket-grade, previously frozen item that had little to no taste other than sugar. ˜The young woman at the counter seemed sullen and uninterested. ˜What a shame."
10991,1356,4,0,7/26/2014,"We were on vacation looking for something quick easy and non-chain. With good reviews. This fit the bill. We did take out back to the hotel with the kids. I got the veggie platter, my husband got lamb kebabs, Plus an order of seared cauliflower. Both came with rice and what appeared to be homemade bread. We split with the kids cause they are small orders were big enough to give the kids some and not feel deprived. My husband loved his lamb, And would not stop talking about the bread. I thought the bread was excellent. The kids loved the seared cauliflower. Which in my eyes looked deep fried. The green dipping sauce that was homemade with herbs was awesome with the cauliflower all sauces were homemade. It Was busy with a 75 price order for take out, but still didn't take long they knew how to staff properly. . Seemed popular with the locals. Service was good my husband wanted to go back a second night the only reason the review is not five stars is I found the veggies to be over the top with grease. They were tasty But I think they could have used to be put in a spider before being boxed to get the extra grease off. The grease leaked in the bag too. Spinach that came with the platter was perfect. I would go again next time I want to try the falafel. Price value was great two meals and cauliflower $27. I asked our hotel if they knew about this place before we went and they did not. We almost didn't go glad we did."
10992,1356,5,0,5/21/2014,REALLY good gyro and falafel pitas. Their tzatziki sauce and hot sauce seals the deal. Some of the best sides are the eggplant and chickpeas. Large portions at a fair price.
10993,1356,5,0,4/6/2014,Just had our first experience at Jahan Kabob. It was excellent. Awesome Gyros for 6.99 with great middle eastern spices. And they're HUGE! The hummus is fresh as can be! Great addition to Morrisville.
10994,1356,5,0,3/31/2014,"My friends and I discovered Jahan Kebab grill in the beer mart in Oxford Valley before they opened this site in Morrisville. ˜We were hooked on the food there, so for them to move 3 blocks away from my house is heaven! ˜ The food is all halal, prepared fresh by Abdul, one helluva friendly guy whose family runs both locations. ˜The restaurant is a very pleasant atmosphere, colorful and inviting. ˜But the best part by far is the food! Most dishes are between $5-15. The menu is diverse, with kebabs, middle eastern/Afghani dishes, gyros (and some American dishes for the less adventurous). ˜The Afghan food is outstanding! ˜The lamb curry will make you cry it's so good. ˜Served with aromatic long-grain rice and fresh-baked naan, it's the most delicious dish on the menu in my opinion. ˜A close second is the shank of lamb, which just falls-off-the-bone tender and so tasty. ˜I've had bites of the chicken dishes my friends have ordered and they're excellent as well. ˜The gyros are good and nice size serving, and the kebabs are tender and full of flavor. They also serve breakfast. ˜There are some of the usuals... pancakes, french toast, eggs and potatoes. ˜The food is halal, so no pork products, but the turkey bacon was really good... not the typical pressed turkey alternative you get at most diners. ˜I tried the Persian eggs... poached eggs with sauteed peppers and onions and kebab meat. ˜ Excellent! ˜ This place offers a terrific alternative to pizza and burgers in this town, by far my favorite restaurant in the boro. ˜DEFINITELY worth a try!"
10995,1356,5,0,3/27/2014,"Tonight we were ecstatic to find out that we had the most awesome Middle Eastern cuisine right here in Bucks County! ˜We had the Falafel sandwich and it was so absolutely delicious, fresh ingredients.. SPECTACULAR! ˜And the baklava was out of this world. ˜I cannot wait to try every thing on their menu. ˜Finding this gem was the highlight of my stressful week."
10996,1356,5,1,11/19/2014,I am a regular at the farmers market in the same shopping center. I am a gyro fan and the sign caught my attention. Boy was I in for a treat. Ordered Lamb Gyro and it was authentic and delicious. The best Gyro I have had in years. Can't wait to try out the rest of the menu. Nothing better than finding a great new place to eat in your backyard!
10997,1356,5,1,10/16/2014,"I stopped in here and was surprised to see they had such a diverse menu, I just needed to use the bathroom and felt guilty so I ordered a hummus and it came with naan bread. This is the best hummus, ˜I ever tasted. ˜They place was packed so the food must be delicious!"
8149,1356,4,1,10/16/2014,"Fantastic Food - including Kabobs and Gyros and a terrific lunch special for $7.95. ˜Very small place and super casual. Quick, friendly service and delectable sides like Cauliflower & Sabzi! Yum!!!!"
10998,1356,5,1,10/12/2014,The food here is delicious. I definitely recommend it to anyone in this area. This is definitely not the last time I will be eating here.
10999,1356,4,1,10/12/2014,Both the kabobs and gyros are very good. I haven't eaten but only take out. The food is delicious!
11000,1356,5,1,10/12/2014,"We were looking for a place to eat and out of the corner of my eye in a nondescript shopping center over a nondescript store front I saw the word Falafel and kept on driving thinking Falafel in Morrisville? No way.We were hungry and my wife looked up Jahan Kabob on Yelp and lo and behold there were great reviews. ˜Did ˜a quick U-turn and walked into what I can now say was Falafel heaven. Both of us having lived on falafel during our college days in New York And New Haven,Ct ˜becuase it was inexpensive and we were poor have always sought out the best we could and we would go to NYC from New Hope to our favorite Falafel joints.. Thats 140 miles round trip. We are vegetarian and there is little for us where we live. We thought we were Falafel aficionados. Nope. No more trips to the big city. We have found our home..No more of where do you want to go to eat tonight? Pizza again? Best falafel we have had in decades.The family owned establishment made us feel like we were in their home. Never tasted Nan so good to find out it is made in house. The falafel didnt even drip. The dressing was impeccable. Never had seared cauliflower but we will again. We looked through the menu. We were amazed at the breakfast offerings and if we were meat eaters would have loved to sample some items.. By the way if you dont try the Humus (get a large) you will regret it. My son called from the west coast tonight and for the first 15 minutes all we talked about was the most amazing meal we had at ˜this establishment. It is not fancy at all inside but we could care less. Now, when we ask each other where we should go out for a meal the answer will be very simple. No more trips to NYC for falafel and the vegetarian dishes. We found nirvana and to think we can get there in 30 minutes. Life is good."
11001,1356,5,1,9/23/2014,"Jahan Kabob is a ""Foodie's"" dream! ˜All the ingredients are top quality & prepared to order. The Gyros & Kabobs have generous portions and the pricing is very reasonable. If the decor & neighborhood were more upscale, the prices would be higher. I would compare this restaurant to any 5 star Mediterranean eatery! Give it a try - you'll return often like I do"
11002,1356,5,1,9/8/2014,"Went here for the first time this weekend. I'm a fan! I had mixed vegetables, Mediterranean chicken, falafel, hummus, chickpeas, spinach - all of it was delicious. The owner is very accommodating (eg. Grilled instead of frying for me, substituted a couple things) and cooks the food himself. Great value, plus I even had enough left over for a second dinner. I'll be back!"
11003,1356,5,1,9/1/2014,Found this place while dropping my daughter back to college at TCNJ. ˜The staff was very friendly and the food was great. ˜The lamb tikka was extremely tender and flavorful as well as the kabuli palao. ˜The seekh and chapli kabob were not as good as the lamb tikka. ˜Next time we will definitely have the lamb tikkas and may try the chicken tikkas as well. ˜Lamb tikkas best in the tri-state area while my search for the best Chapli Kabab in the USA continues.
11004,1356,4,1,8/15/2014,Pretty tasty! A lot in the menu and if you are not familiar with this type of food be prepared to ask a lot of questions there's just not enough description on the menu itself so we sat for five minutes and asked a lot of questions before making our decision since it was the first time we were there! I highly suggest the owner has pictures Of every dish. we sampled a few of the different entr?e selections and it was plenty of food. The rice is especially tasty. We did like the kebabs and they had very nice char grill flavor to them and they were a good quality piece of meat! It's not our every day type of food but a welcome addition to the Morrisville area -you must try it at least once... I'm sure you will be back - we will be too!
11005,1356,5,1,8/14/2014,This was my first time trying Jahan Kabob & grill and it was amazing!!! I had the falafel pita with French fries (the lunch special) it is the best falafel I have ever had!! The combination of flavors from the hummus and tzatziki plus the fresh vegetables was perfect!! The fries were even amazing. I will definitely be ˜going back again and would recommend this place to anyone. The restaurant itself is very clean and looks nice.
11006,1356,5,1,8/10/2014,"Place is awesome. Gyros are top notch. Homemade sauces, succulent meats. Took my boys here and sat at the counter. People working here are cool. You can tell they care about what they are doing and know how to do it well..."
11007,1356,5,1,8/4/2014,Food is great and the staff are extremely friendly! I will definitely be a repeat customer!
11008,1356,5,1,8/2/2014,Ok so we've already discovered that all their food is delicious...but this review is about their HUMMUS!!! OMG.. it literally is the best hummus I've ever had. ˜The naan isn't my favorite bread but once you slap some hummus on it it's like something i've never had. ˜It literally is soooo good. ˜I probably could have just had that for dinner. ˜Wow. ˜Get the hummus!!!
11009,1356,5,1,7/30/2014,"I have been going to this place since it's been open in Langhorne, PA. It has recently moved to Morrisville and I still love it! It's a small take out place but the decor is very cute inside. The service is super friednly! Their cholay and fried cauliflower is amazing! I also loved their veggie somasa's and the fallafel is super big and delcious! Also you must try their lassi and their green tea!! I'm so glad there is a middle eastern resturant around here! I'm so tired of traveling to New Hope, Philadelphia or New Jersey for it. ˜I LOVE this resturant."
11010,1356,5,1,7/27/2014,Yum! Great homemade food from friendly people- you can't ask for more! Great naan and hummus!
11011,1356,4,1,7/7/2014,"Took a chance on this new restaurant in the Morrisville shopping center. Ordered the beef tikka kabob. It came with a fresh, fresh salad, with a creamy delicious tzatziki sauce. The beef had a delicious flavor, although it wasn't as tender as the chicken tikka kabob. The rice was flavorful and the carrot spicy chutney- WOW!!!! Definitely will be back often!"
11012,1356,4,1,7/7/2014,"Morrisville has been in need of a better variety of dining choices. ˜Jahan Kabab is exactly what's been missing. ˜Not only was the food excellent and the facility clean, but the service was outstanding too. I had the Chicken Tikka plate with rice and nan bread. ˜This dish was excellent. ˜The salad was fresh and looked like a piece of art. ˜The menu has a robust variety that should please even the most picky."
11013,1356,5,1,7/4/2014,Excellent food and service! A new regular spot for us. We had chicken kabob and chicken gyro. Both great.
10701,1356,5,1,5/13/2014,"Ever since Jahan Kabob moved to Morrisville, this has been our go to place for a carnivorous binge. Succulent meats, great flavors, huge portions and a very casual atmosphere. How can one not fall in love with this place? For appetizers, we'd recommend the hummus. The hummus comes with a side of Afghani naan which goes really well with it. We've tried most of their grilled fare and love the lamb chop kabob in particular. If you love chicken, we'd recommend their chicken chapli kabob, seekh kabob or tikka kabob. Highly recommend this gem of an ethnic restaurant close to Trenton. Check it out and decide for yourselves. Now I sound like a commercial for this place haha"
11014,1356,4,1,5/7/2014,Tasted Lamb curry and it was good. It took a while for them to bring food to the table. Felt portion would have been larger but that's just me. My friend ordered a veggie dish and his portion was decent. Overall a nice lunch option. Will be visiting more often to try other items on menu.
8469,1356,4,1,5/7/2014,Generous portions for lunch Seared cauliflower was fried not seared Place was clean No gluten free options Nor whole wheat Available Mixed gyro was spicy and tasty Chicken seekh kabob was ground chicken Not whole chicken
11015,1356,5,1,4/25/2014,It was the first time that I went there and was very pleasantly surprised. The food was excellent and the prices were very reasonable.
11016,1356,5,1,4/23/2014,Great food. Worth going out of your way for. Fantastic catering take out menu. Look at all of the other reviews. ˜4 to 5 stars
11017,1356,4,1,4/13/2014,"I liked it, large servings, a little expensive for what it is but its different and that makes it good!"
11018,1356,4,1,4/8/2014,"The food was fresh, tasty, and the service was friendly and personal. This restaurant opened up recently and it's just what this area needs. My husband ordered the shrimp kabob with rice and it was great. It was freshly made and flavorful. It also came with a side salad which was fresh. Even good restaurants serve brown wilted lettuce and call it a salad but not this place. I had the Jahan special gyro with all different meats and it was a large sandwich with great flavor. I was so full but I could not stop eating. There are tables and chairs to sit down and eat and it's a casual atmosphere and a reasonable price for the quality of food."
11019,1356,5,1,4/2/2014,"Great food at a reasonable price! We found this restaurant at its old location and fell in love - but now the convenient Morrisville, PA location means even more visits to this awesome food oasis! We've had kofta and gyro and samosas and kabobs - it was all good. ˜Even the chickpeas are amazing. The gentleman who waited on me, whom I assume to be the proprietor, is very gracious and kind. Please do yourself a huge favor and try Jahan Kabob & Grill. The new location is very clean and inviting Next time, I plan to try the curry. Yum!"
7540,1356,2,1,4/2/2014,Not feeling this location. The other 1 is better. It took about 30 mins for take out! No one had a clue what as going on either. The hummus as good too but the bred that came with it was hard as a rock! Sorry but I'll stick with your other place!!
10699,1356,5,1,3/31/2014,"This Jahan Kabob is the sister ship to a joint by the same name on Oxford Valley Road in Langhorne. ˜Yeah! That's right. The place tucked into the corner of a craft beer store just behind the Super Wawa. ˜But, the similarity ends with the name. ˜ Abdul the owner and chef remembered me from the other place and gave me a smile. ˜His daughter sat by the register taking orders and making friendlies with the customers. ˜While waiting in line and perusing the take out menu, I took a look around this brand new Afghani/Middle Eastern establishment. ˜The bright neon beckoned all who find Morrisville an interesting, if offbeat, destination. ˜The floors were covered with oriental rug runners giving the space a feel of ethnicity, and in the rear stood a low platform with 6 meditation pillows for the Believers who felt the demand to pray before dining. Ah Salaam Ahlaikum, my brothers and sisters. When I entered I had intended to pick up and go, but the vibe (and aroma) was so unusual, that I decided to find a table to enjoy my meal right there. ˜When I reached the front of the line I had not decided what I wanted. ˜I asked Kadrianne what she recommended. ˜Abdul heard me, and turned from the grill to answer, ""Chicken Curry is what you want."" Obediently, I agreed. Sometimes, Kismet takes a hand. He was totally right. ˜A few minutes later a plate full of thick yellow golden gravied Chicken chunks and a large pile of Long Grain ""Dirty"" Rice was placed before me. The flavors came through my nose first almost bringing me to tears. My tongue joined the festival a second later. ˜It is amazing how different curry tastes around the world, because this was neither Indian, nor Thai curry, but something in between. ˜Cooler and more subtle than it Indian brothers, and suggesting a tartness that its Thai cousins have mastered. ˜It was unique and savory; smooth and expressive. ˜The Rice was wonderfully mildly sweet in contradistinction to the Chicken. It seemed the obvious thing to do was mix them together. ˜That was a moment to remember as my oral senses rejoiced. The green Afghani Tea was a good astringent between shoveling the delectables into my mouth. ˜The Sesame Cookie at the end of the meal, a kind token of appreciation. ˜ The other reviews are on target in 5 Starring Jahan Kabob. ˜This is a special place that will get even better with time, and become a landmark helping put Morrisville back on the cuisinery map where it belongs."
10119,1356,5,1,3/30/2014,"I was literally stalking this place until it opened BC there aren't many middle eastern places around here. Plus, I know that small mom & pop shops are usually where it's at with flavor and Jahan surely delivered! I came in for lunch on the go and decided to order a conservative Chicken Gyro just to see how it went. ˜Needless to say I was unable to make it to my next destination because the delicious smell of gyro penetrated the car and forced me to pull over for a bite. As a sat in a parking lot devouring my giant pita stuffed with deliciously seasoned chicken, lettuce, cucumbers, and finger licking sauces, I was so thankful that Jahan opened up so close to me. I was so impressed with the food, that literally the next day I was back! I tried to order something different, but why mess with a good thing? I did add an order of samosas, which unlike Indian samosas are flat, like quesadillas with potato and veggies inside. It came with this addicting green sauce, kind of like a creamy chimichurri sauce and I've decided next time I go in I will buy a bottle of the stuff from them because it was soooo good. All in all I am a Jahan believer! In closing, do the next three steps: 1. A chicken gyro - with hot sauce (it's mild) 2. An order of samosas - share one with a friend, but keep the green sauce for yourself. 3. Send me a compliment for showing you the light.* *Step 3 is optional."
11020,1356,5,1,3/28/2014,"Had lunch here today and the food is delicious! ˜ We had hummus, lamb kebab, and felafel - all fresh, extremely flavorful, made with care and friendly service. ˜Will be back often. ˜Much needed addition to the Morrisville food ""scene""."
11021,50,5,0,1/1/2015,I just had to give a shout out to this place. I have never seen employees so friendly. They definitely go above and beyond here & make you feel welcome. Very rare nowadays
11022,50,4,1,9/14/2014,The food is fresh and the restaurant is pretty clean. The service here is much better than the other Wendy's in Wayne on 46.
11023,50,4,1,4/17/2014,"For unknown reasons, I've never been to a Wendy's after all this time. I ate the Dave's Hot 'N Juicy Double combo. Everything was fine except that I found the burger sandwich sliding around and then apart at times, making for a more complicated eating experience than I had expected. Maybe it was just me. No refills."
11024,50,5,1,4/8/2013,For a fast food place they get 5 stars. They've never screwed up an order for me at the drive through and the food is ready by the time you pull up to the window after paying. Can't ask for anything else from a drive through window.
7271,50,3,1,8/13/2012,"I came in here on a Sunday evening to get some free coffee with my mother. The restaurant wasn't particularly packed, and we were in and out of the place pretty quick."
11025,3345,1,0,8/24/2014,"My friend was invited by the owner who he met earlier in the day. So we decided to give it a try. I would love to tell you how good the food was but that would require service. We literally were seated for 15 minutes before we called someone over to be told that she was not our server. Unbelievable! After another 10 minutes we just left. I would not recommend any one going there if you like service. There are too many restaurants in the area to choose that provide quality service. Oh by the way, who ˜understand they are a service business and their purpose is to offer food and beverages. Terrible!!!"
11026,3345,1,0,5/27/2014,"Terrible service here on Memorial Day during dinner time. First we were told that they were sold out of a lot of things, which is fine. We were told that the Elbow room food was available so we sat down. A waitress came over to take our order and halfway in the middle someone else came over and told us that we had to leave now and the kitchen was closed. There was no apology and no attempt to make us happy."
11027,3345,1,0,5/20/2014,"I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was $10.50. For that amount, I expected more than somewhat dry pork plus a little bit of cole slaw on a plain hamburger bun, the kind you might get at the grocery store in a bag of 8. The owner should be ashamed of him/herself for pricing a sandwich, which might cost $5 at a southern roadhouse (with a full side of 'slaw, most likely), at such a exorbitant price. BBQ is food for the people. Morgan's BBQ needs to make some serious changes."
8981,3345,1,0,4/19/2014,"Greeting- immediate/ friendly Vibe- Texas Roadhouse Price- be careful. These by the pound BBQ places get very expensive. Lunchtime sandwiches are way to go at $10.50 Service- good Parking- good luck Bathroom- horrible. One for all Food Skip watery pinto beans Coleslaw fresh crispy and tasty Collard greens- soft and very spicy Potato salad- thick and tasty Beef sausage- ok at best Brisket- tender and tasteless Dessert Excellent key lime pie $8 The crust makes the pie. Thick, hard and crusty. It's hard to cut. But when you eat it it all comes together. WIGB? Maybe For the pie May 14 second visit French fries are horrible. Like from a public pool concession stand Coleslaw is fresh but watery $3 small Beef tacos are weak. Spicy and tasteless $10 for 3 Key lime pie $8 is still very good. Not tart Pecan pie $8 is horrible WIGB? Only for key lime pie Anybody who thinks this is a good BBQ joint does not know what good BBQ tastes like. Truth also this place was out of corn bread both times at lunch. Come on. Marketing tip- call your tacos and sandwiches brisket not beef. What were you thinking on this ? You are serving brisket not random beef cuts."
11028,3345,1,0,11/8/2013,"In short, horrible. They are always out of something because the new chef is ""perfecting"" his recipe. The pork ribs are dry and tasteless, although fatty at the ends. Burned on the outside, too pink on part of the inside. ZERO flavor. The mack and cheese is mush and flavorless. The cornbread, averge at best and cold. The chili--ugh! Even the pecan pie was mush topped with pecans. The best thing on the menu was coleslaw. Wost was the corn. I think it soaked in hot water for an hour and had a spice sprinkled on it. Truly AWFUL! Who can't do spicy corn? Go to Cuba Cabana if you want good food. Their corn is FAB! And skip that ""Caribbean"" place a few blocks up on flatbush, on the corner by Carlton. Seems these new places in Park Slope are for those rich yuppies who want to eat ""ethnic"" or BBQ, but want it bland. If you like real BBQ, do not go near this place. ˜The waitresses are nice though. Also, portions are small--good or bad depending on what you want."
11029,3345,1,0,10/28/2013,"Reading the reviews for this place ˜simply restores my belief that New Yorkers are the nicest people on this planet. To give this place more than one star is generous beyond belief Got there and I was promptly informed that more than half the menu items were missing in action. Alas the sandwich I ordered should have joined its friends. This tiny sausage sandwich, accompanied with grossly overpriced and bland mac and cheese, was at best disappointing and at its worst anorexic in substance and taste. I highly recommend that everyone should visit Morgans, but under no circumstances enter the premises."
11030,3345,1,0,10/27/2013,Nice staff. ˜2 of the drinks i ordered were unavailable (no jack Daniels ..... And no Johnny walker ) . ˜The mac and cheese was bland no flavor. ˜Like it made with American cheese .... Instead of extra sharp cheddar .. ˜ The food came in what seems like 3-5 mins. ˜ ˜ Not impressed..... Whole experience very Blahhhhhhhh only thing that saved the night was the angry orchard apple cider
11031,3345,1,0,10/13/2013,"Three friends and I just returned from a miserable ""brunch"" at Morgans. The first sign of trouble came as we sat down and were told that only two of about eight brunch items were available. As they are still in their ""soft opening"" phase, we found this disappointing, but acceptable. When we tried to order coffee, we were told they don't serve it, as ""Texas barbecue doesn't do coffee."" This took a moment to process. Coffee is not available with brunch? The news alone was bad enough, but the attitude it was served with nearly had us walking out the door (spoiler alert: that would've been the better move). We placed our orders from our limited options, and then two of us set off to retrieve coffees down the block at Hungry Ghost. At least Morgans did not begrudge us the outside drinks. We received our food, (a bland breakfast burrito, a tasty but slider-sized pulled pork sandwich, an El Paso omelette, and smoked pork tacos). The taco order was missing its side of frijoles, so we asked the server for them. He dismissed the request, saying that they didn't come with the order. We were skeptical, but we finished eating without complaint. While waiting for the check, we took another look at the menu and saw that the beans, as we had already pointed out, did in fact come with the tacos. We again mentioned it to the server at the end of the meal, and he said that while he believed us, he would double check the menu. Once he returned, he acknowledged the beans did indeed come with the tacos. Server: ""The beans are coming out now."" Me: ""It's okay, we're done with our meal, we don't want them now."" Server: ""We can pack them up to go."" By that point, we had already finished up our meal, so it was too little, too late. Me: ""No thanks, maybe you can just take something off the price of the dish."" Server: ""I'll see."" Several minutes pass and the server said he wasn't going to take anything off the price. To review: no coffee, limited menu, small portions, big mistake to come here. ˜I created this Yelp account to warn fellow brunch and coffee lovers: don't eat here - the service is awful, and if you ask for what you ordered, you'll get served a whole lot of attitude instead."
11032,3345,2,0,6/26/2014,"This place is 2 blocks from my house and i was pretty excited when it opened because i lived in Texas for 20 years and i LOVE BBQ! I don't know where most of you writing good reviews are from, but this place is no good man. DavidM from 14 days ago is probably being paid by Morgans or just hasn't had good bbq. If you're gonna charge $20-22/lb for brisket, I expect a certain quality. If they charged $12/lb that would be about right. The brisket wasn't even as good as Rudy's(Texans get it) and the turkey was juicy but rubbery and didn't taste good. Sausage was dry and horribly average. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I will not go back. The staff is friendly, that's the only positive I can think of. The best bbq I've had in Brooklyn, without a doubt, is Fetta Sau. Expensive as s@#t but kinda worth it. Brisket is great, sides are pretty awesome"
11033,3345,4,0,12/8/2013,"Very good BBQ. My favorite by far is the brisket.. so satisfying. Brisket itself gets 5 stars- it is as good as brisket can possibly get. Everything served family style, no frills, just order the kind of meat you want and how much and it is brought out. The pork ribs are also good, and so is the mac and cheese. Get the brisket."
11034,3345,5,0,9/19/2014,"I ran inside Morgan's in the rain, a few minutes before they closed the kitchen. The bar was still bustling. The bartender noticed me immediately. ""Do you still have food?"" I asked, dripping rain and out of breath. ""3 more minutes! You just made it!"" I was so relieved, I LOVE the chopped brisket sandwich. I picked up a sandwich and a pound of brisket for my bf. Great BBQ, amazing authentic smokey flavor!"
11035,3345,5,0,5/24/2014,"Ever since I moved to Brooklyn - well, two months ago - from out West, I""ve been looking for some great barbecue, and I've finally found it! Best brisket this side of Texas, and the perfect place to watch the games. Great, spicy collared greens, good beer selection, and tasty Mac ' N Cheese. When it's nice out, the outdoor seating can't be beat. Morgan's is my new addiction."
11036,3345,5,0,4/20/2014,"As a Southerner from NC, I know good barbeque! ˜NC does have the BEST vinegar based pork BBQ anywhere to be found:) Visiting my daughter, she suggested we go check out this place, Morgan's Barbecue she had found. ˜We were greeted by a friendly staff - later in conversation about their method of preparing the sauce, we found out out waiter was from Lousiana and also was familiar with good Southern BBQ. I tried the pulled pork BBQ and the Brisket with green beans and mac and cheese. Having eaten a considerable amount of Texas beef BBQ and NC pork BBQ, I can attest that Morgan's certainly is true to the Texas style BBQ and Brisket. Their sauce was a bit on the sweet side for me but it is quite good. The BBQ itself is 100% true Texas style - rubbed in a tasty pepper mix that brings out the flavor of any slow cooked BBQ. Brisket was tender and had the same pepper based rub. I found the meal on the pricy side - certainly not in the range of prices we are used to in NC for the portions. This is true Texas BBQ so if you are in the mood check out Morgan's - your taste buds will jump for joy."
11037,3345,5,0,3/6/2014,"ELBOW ROOM'S MAC AND CHEESE IS WAYYY BETTER THAN THE STANDARD MAC....guy's you gotta do this year 'round. I tasted the Chicken Tinga Mac and my boyfriend had the Jamaican Jerk. The chicken tinga mac was full of flavor ˜and the avocado was fresh. I tried some of my boyfriends Jamaican Jerk which was a little spicy but the freshly grilled pineapple eased some of that pain. We came in on a Tuesday night, which to me is way better than coming on a Saturday, nothing was sold out. Morgans is the place to go. As a crown heights resident, I will be a regular. THE RIBS, THE SERVICE, & the Mac & cheese, is all i need in life."
11038,3345,5,0,12/7/2013,"Y'all got that bomb ass brisket and even bomber ass servers, i.e, Feleahcia and Mariel! Thanks for the experience!!"
11039,3345,5,0,10/18/2013,"You just can't find a better BBQ place in Brooklyn, The brisket was moist and delicious, pork rib were divine. and the customer service was incredible. We were seated out side and it began to rain. We were a table of 20 and the owner ran to the corner store and bought everyone umbrella and gave us free alcohol and even baked my wife a cake... ˜Really one of the best dining experiences i've had in NYC and I've been here all my life."
11040,3345,5,0,9/19/2013,"We are very picky about our BBQ, as my better half is a native Texan. ˜Whenever we go to Texas, our first stop, before doing anything else, is usually a drive-by to Good Company BBQ to pick up some ribs. ˜We've now eaten at Morgan's twice and both times have walked away convinced that this is the BEST Texas-style BBQ in New York. ˜The owner came from Texas (Austin and Houston) and understands how to make authentic Texas BBQ. ˜The brisket (we've had both lean and fatty) was amazing - and the pulled pork was equally so. ˜We don't often order chicken at BBQ restaurants - but the chicken here was cooked perfectly - it had so much flavor and there was no drying out as sometimes happens with BBQ. ˜We also love the BBQ sauce - not vinegary like North Carolina sauce. ˜The sides - including the green beans and the collared greens - were also excellent (and we are often not fans of sides in BBQ restaurants). ˜To finish, the pecan pie was delicious - it's made with bourbon - so not too sweet and just the way we like it. ˜I should also add - that on both of our trips, the staff was extremely helpful and nice."
5386,3345,4,1,1/3/2015,"Excellent barbecue place. Fatty pulled pork was amazing (but very fatty, of course). Ribs better than most other bbq places. Hill country has slightly better brisket. Place is somewhat big but still crowded."
11041,3345,4,1,1/2/2015,"Had a great time at this place. Ordered the Jerk Chicken Mac n Cheese, Corn in a Cup, Collard Greens, Chili Cheese Fries, and half a chicken. The Mac and Cheese was amazing and worth the trip in itself. The chicken I received was under cooked but at I was already full from the other stuff so I didn't make a big fuss. Will come here again! Also, the Old Fashioned were made just like I like it."

Fellow Yelpers, take this review with care on your next trip there and avoid the circumstances that are similar to ours. I dont like to waste my time writing but I only write if something got way out of hand. This place was one of them...I HAVE TO LET THE PEOPLE KNOW. Went to Morgan's after a Net's game. Initially wanted to get Dino BBQ but upon arriving there, we found out they didn't have any major meat players (brisket, ribs) so we took a chance and trekked to Morgan's feeling that they would have more selection because they close an hour later than Dino..what a MISTAKE. THEY HAD LESS... Manager of Morgan's, if you actually go on Yelp to read about your restaurant, let me begin by saying that by the end of the night, we still did not know who our server was... There were 2 women rotating with service at our table (why?)... We got our water from one woman, got orders taken from another, and was served by the former. That is not even the lowlight of the night. First off, one server was drinking alcohol while on her shift. She was drinking with what seemed to be her friends who were in to visit. Only helped us reluctantly when her FRIENDS POINTED IT OUT. IMAGINE!? EVEN HER FRIENDS HAD MORE OF AN IDEA TO HELP A PATRON. HER FRIENDS SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HOME THE EARNINGS... Second, the other server was a drama queen who was rather rude and would ignore patrons on purpose, pretending not to have seen an outstretched hand asking for assistance. Im not one to bash on people, but that is quite rude that she decided for herself when and whether she would come over and provide help. What was even ruder was she called out the table next to us when they were about to leave with such attitude. She said in a loud voice, ""sorry I dont know if you guys know, but we didnt include gratuity.."" One of the patrons opened the check holder and showed that they had indeed left the tip. All the server did was say dryly, ""thanks."" That left such a sour taste in my mouth. How rude do you have to be to do that? Who's doing the hiring in this restaurant? Where was the apology at least? Holy Toledo, maybe the person who hired those ladies has an agenda with the boss.. I dont know, Im just saying. You dont hurt your business like that by hiring people like those 2. That night, Morgan's did not have the main meat players as well. Even when they closed at 12... Ok fine, understandable if all Morgan's does is serve alcohol and whatever but do try to let people know that maybe the kitchen would close at a certain time and not serve the main course meat.. We ended up getting macaroni and cheese with potato salad and a sausage. Here is the food breakdown: Both Mac and Cheese (got the mushroom and chicken with avocado) were warm. Mac and Cheese should be hot and gooey. The cheese should be elastic right? BZZZ wrong. It just detached faster than a retina after an eye gouge.... Even if it is late at night, I expect to get my money's worth of food quality. Do you agree? Dont use closing time as an excuse. If you do, you might as well offer a late night discount. The potato salad was the only good thing, know why? Because it's the ONLY thing that needed to be refrigerated. Meaning you cant really screw it up so long as it is in cold air... I did not forget about the pork sausage. Ready for this? Drier than the desert. Obviously it's been kept in the kitchen for quite some time. Absolutely terrible. Eating it made me thirsty and that is no exaggeration. And here is the most HEINOUS crime that night. Ms Drama Queen tried to play us for fools when we called for the check. Let me turn back the clock to let you fellow readers know the situation. We ordered the lean brisket because Ms Drinks on the Job told us that that is the only brisket they had left. Fine, all good in the neighborhood like Mr Rogers. After the order was placed, Ms Drama Queen comes over and tells us that they actually ran out of brisket. Ok FINE. I told her we will cancel the brisket and order the drier than hippo skin sausage. She said ok. Back to the HEINOUS crime. Ms Drama Queen gave us the check and the brisket was there... You, the reader might say, it could be an accident. Well.. I dont think so.. Why was the sausage order listed above the brisket?.. That bugs me more than a fly to an elephant. Boy what a scheme. Unbelievable. Look, Im not saying to not eat at this place. Just please NEVER GO AT NIGHT AFTER 10.. I left only 6% tip because tips are not a privilege. It is earned with hard and respectful work. It is supposed to reflect the quality of work you are doing. Just me, but Im not returning. And others will hear about this"

11044,3345,5,1,12/28/2014,"I don't often write restaurant reviews, but my experience last night at Morgan's was so good that it motivated me to join Yelp to write this review We took my entire family here, all 17 of us, for dinner before the Nets game last night. ˜As a long-time BBQ enthusiast, I was skeptical that I'd find decent BBQ in Brooklyn, but the yelp reviews and the proximity to the Barclays Center convinced me to give it a try. ˜ There is only one word for for the meal we had last night, and that is ""spectacular"". ˜The dry beef and pork ribs were out of this world, the chicken tender and juicy, and the Okra and corn-bread are amazing. ˜Oh, and the Mac and cheese (something like 6 different varieties) is without question the best Mac and cheese I've ever had. The deserts brought tears to my eyes. And to top it all off, the staff all have the most beautiful smiles, are friendly, attentive and fast. If you are a BBQ fan, anywhere in the US, you owe it to yourself to plan a visit to Brooklyn for some of the best BBQ you will find anywhere. If you are headed to the Barclays Center for a concert or a game, you're cheating yourself if you don't go to Morgan's for dinner first. I cannot wait to go back."
11045,3345,5,1,12/20/2014,"Easily the best BBQ I've had in the 5 boroughs. We were a table of 4, and we split a number of the large sides--collards, cole slaw, and corn, all of which were delicious. ˜I'm a cole slaw fanatic, and their slaw was fresh and crunchy, not soupy. ˜The collards were spicy and sweet all at once, and the corn had cotija cheese magic all over it. We also shared two of the Elbow Room mac & cheese options--the Buffalo, and the Tingha. ˜The Buffalo won everyone's heart for sure, but the Tingha was really yummy too. I shared a pork link (nice snap to it) and pork ribs (fall-off-the-bone tender) with my husband, and though I could only eat a bit of each because of how rich it all was, it was totally top notch. ˜I had a bite of his brisket as well, and it was probably the best brisket I've ever had. ˜Full stop. The service was lovely, too, which was a delightful departure from the usual brusqueness I'm accustomed to as a Brooklynite. ˜The bartender entertained us with drinks and comfortable chat when the first two of us arrived. ˜Then, when #3 got there, they showed us to our table ...gasp... BEFORE our entire party arrived ... and it wasn't a problem or big deal to them. ˜Our waitress even came around when happy hour was ending to see if we wanted one last special before the time was up. ˜ Bourbon-pecan pie? ˜Check. Meat sweats after? ˜Check. Sweet, sweet, meaty dreams all night? ˜Check and check."
11046,3345,1,1,12/14/2014,"After many years of lurking, I literally joined Yelp this evening to post a recap of one of the worst meal experiences I've ever had. After having been turned away from Morgan's a few months ago (they served me a drink but then said they were having a private party so I had to leave), I was anxious to return after hearing such good things about their bbq. Arriving on a Sunday evening, we were told that the only available menu items were sandwiches and sides for the next hour. Not sure why, if you can make me a brisket sandwich, you can't also just put some brisket on a plate. But ok, we said, sandwiches only. My friend tried ordering a beef sausage sandwich, but nope, they're out of beef sausage. ˜So now that we've reduced the menu to about four available options, my friend and I finally settled on an order. After waiting over ten minutes to get our beers delivered, the food came out. My friend's brisket sandwich was decent, he said. My pulled pork sandwich was dry and completely lacking in flavor. This was really bad, even grading on an NYC curve. Then we asked for our check and noticed that we were charged for our side dishes, despite all the sandwiches coming with 1 side dish. When we brought this to our server's attention, she told us oh no--get this--the sandwiches only come with 1 side M-F. On the weekends, my tiny cup of potato salad is $5. All told, we spent 50 bucks on 2 beers, 2 sandwiches, and 2 sides. Without question, the worst dinner I've had in Brooklyn. Bummer."
11047,3345,2,1,12/12/2014,"OMG, 1pm on a Friday and they ran out of brisket? We came here just for this! What are you going to tell the dinner people? Also you can't get corn bread or beef ribs at lunchtime. I guess this is a part time restaurant."
11048,3345,5,1,12/9/2014,"Hooray! great BBQ is in brooklyn, at last! ˜i've been eating here at least once a week for the past month! ˜the ribs are--meat falls clean off the bone--perfect! ˜the fatty brisket is so tender and juicy it's like some southern belle was back there massaging it while it cooked. ˜the mac and cheese options were serious eats! ˜not the runny, sad kind of mac and cheese, but the hearty, loaded, lutheran hot-dish kind. ˜it's soooo yummy! ˜great beer served in mason jars are a nice home-style touch. ˜also, the chili is so hearty w/it's tender meat chunks, it could be enjoyed as a stand-alone dish, but seriously, once you're there, you want a bit of everything! ˜and the nice thing is, you can! ˜the half pound portions make it possible to share and taste just about everything without wasting food or feeling like you're fat belly is going to burst. ˜strangely enough, having just the right amount of food, is really satisfying. ˜even the adorable little pies are delicious and perfectly sized! my only suggestion is that they offer some more veggie options. ˜maybe broccoli or okra? ˜a simple side salad or kale to balance out the protein? ˜the collards are ok, but not on the top of my list. ˜in any case, this place is darn good overall. ˜ here's the catch, do not go during busy weekends. ˜the music becomes unfit for human ears. ˜in the summer, sit outside to avoid the noise, but if you're like me, just go during a weekday and try to sit far from the bar (the bartenderess likes her music, teenage-angst-style loud). ˜like a true southern-style 'cue lover, i don't like to feel rushed and i don't like to shout over crappy music. ˜if anything, the only sound around me should be cicadas and the occasional 18-wheeler rolling by."
11049,3345,5,1,12/9/2014,"Easily among the best BBQ restaurants in NYC (and I could easily be convinced it was #1), Morgans BBQ brings expertly smoked pork shoulder, sausage links, falling off the bone pork ribs, and their specialty, incredibly tender fatty brisket. Top that off with an excellent bar stocked with a very deep Bourbon list and you really can not go wrong. We ran out of time to try the seasonal cobbler but I definitely won't miss the next opportunity. This is a great place to go pre-Barclays Center."
11050,3345,4,1,12/9/2014,"BEEF BRISKET (fatty) - of all the bbq places i have tried - Hometown, Dinosaur, Fletcher's they have the best! PULLED PORK - its pulled pork, its gonna be good! MAC AND CHEESE - had the regular m/c. ˜meh okay. TURKEY TAILS - i didn't dig the taste personally so i just won't get it the next time i come back. ˜ and there will be a next time! SEATING - came on a weeknight, wasn't crowded, but I've driven by this place and seen it packed on weekends."
11051,3345,2,1,12/7/2014,"I'm generally a fan of Morgan's, but their brunch was a big miss. I guess it's my own fault for assuming brunch would be...brunch and not family-style BBQ. I was a little surprised when their breakfast hash was that - a paper dish with brisket and potato. My wife did much better ordering the burrito, which was an actual meal and not a pile of meat. It would make a little more sense if family-style items and actual breakfast items were separated on the menu, but these guys were both in the same list of brunch entrees on the brunch menu. The big red flag we ignored was that they don't serve coffee. I guess in Texas they drink Coke with breakfast? They do a great job with lunch and dinner, but brunch was a mistake."
11052,3345,5,1,12/4/2014,"Love the staff! They're always so friendly and suggestive. My favorite item is the Turkey! It's moist and tender and it goes great with the collard greens and Mac & cheese. Brunch is great, although the grits can be a bit too buttery but overall this is a super great place for good bbq."
11053,3345,4,1,11/29/2014,"If you're looking for authentic Texas BBQ this place is it! I'm from Austin, TX home of Rudy's BBQ and The Saltlick. I've been dying for some good BBQ in NYC. You'll meet other Texans in there too. It was great to hear and be a part of a normal Texas conversation again. The staff is friendly. Love the atmosphere inside and great to have the patio tables outside. Great variety of food. Gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it's super pricey. The moist brisket is $24 per lb! In Texas it's like $11. But I got it anyways and it was worth it."
11054,3345,5,1,11/26/2014,"The only thing better than the food, and the selection of whiskey...is the people who work here. The servers, bartenders, even the owners. Always around, willing to help or at least talk."
11055,3345,4,1,11/22/2014,Came here at 1:30am and split a sweet potato with pulled pork. The potato was cooked perfectly with bits of caramelized brown sugar all over the skin and juicy pork drippings on top. The pulled pork was tender and delicious. Since it was so late we didn't want to eat too much but I will definitely be coming back! The liquor selection looks incredible -- with 5 different sorts of mezcal and a very impressive collection of bourbons and whiskeys. They've also partnered up with a mac and cheese spot next door -- the elbow room -- so you could order all sorts of yummy cheesy elbow macs straight vrom their menu! Can't wait to come here and have a proper drink with some mac and fatty brisket. Mmmmm!
11056,3345,5,1,11/21/2014,Absolutely delicious. I ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich and Mac n cheese. Wasn't a ton of food but certainly enough to fill you up.
9464,3345,4,1,11/21/2014,"A friend and I have been looking forward to trying this place for a while and we finally set a date. They have a great location on Flatbush and St. Marks with more space for tables than expected and an outdoor seating area when the weather is better. I have to preface this part of the review with the fact that my friend is a chef and therefore pretty particular. She found the brisket to be overly black-peppery, with large chunks that she had to chew through, so much so that she had to order something else. I agree that it was heavy on the pepper, but for me, the meat itself was delicious. Take our waitresses advice and get the fatty brisket - it is much juicier! My friend did however rave about the collared greens. I ordered the pork ribs which were large and tender - very happy with the selection and also the cheeseburger mac. All of our mac selections, we ordered the mushroom and buffalo as well, were unique and comfortingly delicious! Our table shared a chips and cheese with pulled pork and a slice of their cornbread, both of which were winners for all. Overall, I would definitely come here again. It may not have been the best BBQ I have ever tasted, but it was right up there and the mac was a brilliant touch!"
11057,3345,4,1,11/20/2014,"This will be my new go to before events at Barclays from now on. Happy hour runs until 7 and includes $4 beer, $6 chopped beef sandwiches, and $2 tacos. I believe they also mad have had a special on quesso. The chopped beef sandwich was a decent size with a good amount of meat on it alone with some coleslaw. The meat was very good though a little tough, some BBQ sauce helped add to the flavor. I went with the pulled pork taco which was also very good, it didn't seem to need anything. It's solid BBQ, it's not the best I've had but it's miles above the crap like Dallas BBQ and better than Hill Country. They have a couple decent beers on tap ˜and our waitress was very friendly. The food came out quickly and we were able to make the game on time."
11058,3345,4,1,11/19/2014,Delicious food loved it. Had dinner here with my brother on my visit to NYC. Totally would come back.
11059,3345,4,1,11/15/2014,"The food is consistent, the staff is attentive and its a nice location. ˜One of my go-tos whether is with my boys or my girl."
11060,3345,3,1,11/13/2014,"Overall, OK experience. Great fatty brisket, smokey ribs, nice original mac and cheese, okay potato, and good cocktails to choose from. Good overall Texas style Smokey BBQ, but not a GREAT BBQ. It's pretty good, but all year I kept hearing ""it's the best"". No it isn't. I still prefer Fletcher's over any BBQ. The sauce they have is like a spicy ketchup. Nice waitresses, just be clear in what you want. Now I just went there as it's cold, so no outside seating, but they have a nice outside seating area which has always been packed in the summer time (happy hour times). Number rating 3.7. I'll definitely be back to try more. (Fletcher's meat cuts are great across the board, but their sauce takes it to another level. I've used that sauce on other things as I've had left overs. Morgan's has better mac n cheese.)"
11061,3345,3,1,11/11/2014,"Amateur hour service. ˜Not honoring your daily specials because it's a holiday is a stupid practice, you should be honored I'm patronizing your establishment on a rare day off. ˜No pulled pork sandwiches at 4PM? ˜WTF is going on BOH?! ˜Who's doing inventory/ordering?! ˜I'll improve my review upon my return, get it together the food is awesome and the service needs to step up!"
9462,3345,4,1,11/7/2014,"During a moment of self-loathing, anger, and having a sad pity party I didn't want to do anything at all for my birthday. Which was over a month ago so this review is way over due. I was persuaded at the last second into getting dinner with a few good friends. I didn't actually pick the place but I said Brooklyn and I had this place bookmarked for awhile. Also, barbeque at the end of the summer is always a swell idea. The whiskey and bourbon selection here is fantastic. Beer choice not so much and it is over-priced. The cocktail menu is also kind of lame. Wasn't the biggest fan of their gin based drink with the muddled blueberries. The gin had an over-whelming bitter taste and ""good gin"" shouldn't do that. It should taste like liquid gold. The second drink I had was the Texas sweet tea with bourbon and it was substantially better but tasted just like alcoholic sweet tea in a mason jar. Their cocktails are priced around $9-11. You could be enjoying a good glass of Widow Jane or Buffalo Trace with your meat instead, so do that. The good parts about this place is that I love that it is conjoined with The Elbow Room. The macaroni and cheese here is pretty tasty and very share-able. We ordered a couple different versions. I only tried the Mushroom Mac with crimini mushrooms, spinach, and gruyere cheese. It was very creamy, the wilted spinach and decadent mushrooms with perfect shaped elbow noodles encasing all of that cheese.The only complaints with this may be with that I'm not partial to having an enormous amount of breadcrumbs crunched on top. Others feasted on Margherita Mac with San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil. This was noted as not being cheesy enough or as good as hoped for. The Old School Mac with NY State Sharp Cheddar, b?chamel, and garlic breadcrumbs. - Good, but not the best macaroni ever had. For meats I had the sliced brisket sandwich with a side of cornbread. What I don't like about dining here on the weekends is that a side costs you extra as opposed to weekdays when it is free. LAME. The coleslaw was basic. The brisket even though it was a fresh new batch that we waited an extra 20 minutes for before ordering, since the kind waiters happened to mention they were making a fresh new batch up, wasn't the best quality that I've ever had. Some people complained that the dry rub was extraordinarily spicy. Spicy in the sense of way too much black pepper and seasonings. Not burn my face off heat spicy. I was in the middle on it but agree that less on the rub could have been so much more. The best meat I did happen to sample a small bite of thanks to my buddy Anton and his friends was the GINORMOUS BEEF RIB. I say that because that is the best meat on this menu hands down and you should order it immediately. Between the two of them they ordered two orders of it so I did not feel guilty in the slightest in taking this extra morsel of fatty delicious fall off the bone meat. I never knew in my life that rib meat could be made of not pork and still taste mind blowing. The cornbread lastly was quality with little nuggets of diced up bell pepper and had a hint of sweetness. Finished the meal with an obligatory and embarrassing 'happy birthday brownie' that got passed around. It was okay. But I'd skip on ordering desert here. Overall, decent bbq that could use a few fine tweaks to make it perfect. The Elbow Room definitely helps this place out a bunch with upping its star rating though."
11062,3345,2,1,10/26/2014,"I'm so sorry to say it, but this place is really nothing special. I was so excited to have a barbecue place that's a block away from me, but I've come here 4 times already and still have not been wowed. The meat is typically dry and all you can taste when eating the tacos is spice. The only good thing about this place is that you can order from the elbow room next-door and have it delivered with your meal. Sadly, I've heard that the mac & cheese is not so great either. Skip this place and go to Dinosaur BBQ instead."
9230,3345,5,1,10/16/2014,"Oh my goodness gracious. The fatty brisket, the Frito pie, yeah they're awesome. But. THE COLLARD GREENS!! So very good. beyond good. ˜Seriously, the best collards I have ever had the pleasure of consuming - and I've worked in barbecue! So delightfully vinegary. So tender. So good. So need to be in my belly right now."
11063,3345,3,1,10/8/2014,"Stopped in on a Wednesday afternoon since I was in the neighborhood. Heard the buzz and thought I'd try them since I'm a fan of BBQ. Ordered a pulled pork sandwich for lunch and had a glass of bourbon while I waited. The bourbon was outstanding!! They have an excellent selection of many brands I've never heard of before and the bartender's recommendation was spot on. The pulled pork sandwich was also very good. I had a few beers after my sandwich and ordered a to go bag for dinner. Since it was my first time there and I already had the pulled pork for lunch, I ordered the brisket and ribs for dinner with fries and cole slaw. My friend and I ate them for dinner and both agreed the ribs were very good, the sides were OK...but the brisket was sooooo salty!! OMG! It was nearly inedible. We tried cutting the overwhelming salty flavor by dunking the brisket in sauce but that didn't do much so we just cut all the blackened ends off the brisket in order to eat it. The meat itself was excellent. Did someone make a mistake with the dry rub? This is a decent neighborhood place but not worth going out of my way to again. Ask to sample the brisket before you order a pound and a half to go!!"
11064,3345,3,1,10/3/2014,"Good, but not great. The food is good quality, the pork ribs I ate were definitely above average for NYC, but they just do not compare to most places down South. This is the case with most all NYC cue. Their dry rub here is high quality, I think the actual taste of the pork is a problem. It's ironic because their servers wear shirts that read ""If it ain't smoked all night, it's no good"" and the smoke is what's missing from the flavor in the meat!!!! It's just not there, which is a big let down. The chips and queso were ok too, but again back in Texas you can get better chips and queso almost anywhere. It was just mediocre. You're also paying a lot of money for small portions which sucks. The service though is amazing- the servers here are some of the nicest I've experienced anywhere in NYC, and that's saying a lot. Such nice friendly people working here. Watch out for the beer menu though, $6 shiner bocks???!!!! Are you kidding me? That certainly doesn't match up to some of my old haunts back in TX- they'd through ruckus!!!! I'll give Morgans another chance for sure, but the quest for good cue in NYC continues.....:("
11065,3345,4,1,10/3/2014,"First trip here. Overall, a very good experience. I love the industrial feel of these kinds of places, and coupled with a large outdoor front patio, I immediately knew this was my kind of joint. In terms of the barbecue, these guys hail from Austin, Texas -- probably one of my favorite parts of the country when it comes to producing incredible BBQ meats. When trying BBQ for the first time, I typically measure my initial experience by the quality of their pulled pork sandwich. And for that, Morgan's might just be a 5-star experience. The pork truly melts in your mouth and is so wonderfully seasoned, you just can't stop eating it. And unlike many BBQ joints, the pulled pork here is not dressed with any sauce. Instead, you add in all the sauce you want, courtesy of the plastic squeeze bottles located at each table. The sauce here is excellent too -- it's very thin and vinegary, with a really nice spicy bite. That's the way (uh-huh, uh-huh) I like it. Less impressive was a side cup of corn tossed with cayenne and cojita cheese. The corn was overcooked, and despite a heavy dressing of cheese and seasoning was quite bland. This dish really only works when you grill the corn over a fire and get a nice char, and then serve it on the cob with mayo, cojita, and cayenne. Mexican restaurants have a lock on this dish. We also had to try the mac and cheese, given that they have a whole side business dedicated to that cheesy noodle goodness we've all come to love. Unfortunately, we screwed up by not ordering the simple, classic version, and instead trying their buffalo chicken mac and cheese. This was a real rookie mistake on our part. While the mac and cheese base was generally OK, the addition of buffalo sauce, chicken, and chunks of blue cheese was just too much for us. My recommendation if you come here is to skip all the pre-game treats and sides and just focus on their main attraction -- barbecued meats, smoked and cooked to perfection. For that, Morgan's knocks it out of the park."
11066,3345,5,1,10/2/2014,"I recently went to this place with a group of friends. I liked how there was a giant picnic tables outside, made it feel very southern in the middle of BK. The wait staff is also very friendly, very casual. I ordered the gruelle & mushroom mac and cheese with a side of collard greens (at the insistence of one of my friends) to try it out. I feel in love with the mac and cheese, and although was hesitant to try the collard greens (I usually don't like collard greens) I was surprised at how delicious it was. My friends ordered pulled pork, and ribs, and they loved their food. The saying goes ""you know the food is good when people just shut up and eat"" and that's what we were doing! great place, great food, great ambiance."
11067,3345,4,1,9/29/2014,"I've passed this place so many times and vowed to come in and try! ˜Very casual place, friendly staff and yummy food. ˜I had the brisket sandwich and it was perfect! ˜Soft bun, sweet, tender and tasty brisket with perfect crunchy slaw. ˜Also tried the buffalo Mac n cheese!! ˜Scrumptious!!!! ˜I'll be back to try more items on the menu!! :)"
11068,3345,3,1,9/28/2014,"Thousands of years ago, man hunted animals and cooked meat. I can imagine our ancestors sitting around a fire, tearing away flesh from bone and snapping sinew in a joyous celebratory meal. ˜That tradition can be relived today - minus the blood, guts, fur, and other unpleasantness of hunting and killing your own food - at Morgans. ˜Big tables, ample outdoor space and a great selection of BBQ make this an idea spot for a group get together. ˜And, the bartenders and not only good, but smoking. ˜I'm hoping they don't catch me staring. It's simply good BBQ with an awesome selection of mac n' cheese from Elbow Room. ˜(Why these two were ever separated, requiring separate bills is beyond me since they seem to share a kitchen and are right next door). So, why three stars? ˜The table service. ˜It's, not that good. ˜I'm not one to focus on service as the main criteria for a bad dinning experience, and the service isn't bad. I's simply consistently mediocre. So consistent that i can't assume it was simply an off night. ˜ Case in point, running out of food. ˜Now, a good BBQ place should run out of food. ˜That's actually a good sign, suggesting several possibilities: 1. they cook just enough for what they think the need, 2. they cook only the best ingredients, which means their high standards keep them from using sub-par cuts, 3. BBQ takes time, so they can't just throw something on the grill and have it ready to go. ˜What is bad, is the servers not knowing what the kitchen is out of and then taking 10-20 minutes to let you know that your 1lb order of fatty brisket isn't going to happen. ˜ If I want good Chicken, or pulled pork, or brisket, there are other options within walking distance. ˜But if i want good chicken, pulled pork and brisket, Morgan's is the only game in town. ˜Best bet, sit at the bar. ˜If you find out that your 1lb order of fatty brisket isn't coming, a shot of whiskey from the cute bartenders should make you forget there was a problem."
11069,3345,3,1,9/24/2014,"Met my expectations. Great meat. Great flavors. Not sure they are using the best ingredients. But definitely fulfilled my cravings for greasy meats and mac and cheese. Very heavy, not healthy, but very pleasurable."
11070,3345,4,1,9/18/2014,The food is really great the pulled pork is to die for and so is the pecan pie. The only thing I can say is get there early because this place it so popular food does run out . Lastly the macaroni and cheese is not consistent and it's only good when a specific chef makes it
11071,3345,5,1,9/16/2014,I don't think I can eat BBQ anywhere else after coming here. The fatty brisket was on point and the star of our meal. The meat was super tender and the luscious fat melts away in your mouth like butter. Just reminiscing is making me salivate. My only regret is not ordering a full pound. They serve turkey tails here! ˜Fun fact: The cut is so fatty that it was once banned in Samoa to combat obesity. To hell with that. They were worth each and every artery clogging bite.
11072,3345,5,1,9/14/2014,"This place is absolutely amazing. And when I say amazing I mean my boyfriend and I are here once a week. The food is the only BBQ I will eat in NYC. Unlike every other restaurant, your food comes out very quickly. Any time the food takes longer, they send out a complimentary appetizer (how amazing is that!!!) The staff is so friendly and attentive. ˜I recommend this place to everyone I come in contact with."
11073,3345,4,1,9/9/2014,"I've had great BBQ in Hill Country so naturally, was suspicious of this place as it's far easier to fuck BBQ up than it is to do it right. ˜Great food requires conviction, passion and soul and the combination of all three = love (on a plate). ˜In a word, Morgans does it right. ˜First bite and it was evident - they love me and aim to please. ˜Fatty brisket was peppery, moist and had the perfect ""melt in your mouth"" ratio of fat / meat. ˜The Mac & cheese was oozing with cheese and had the proper ratio of cheese to macaroni, and the collards were not too soggy (as they often are when overlooked) and were just vinegary enough - although, I must say they were a tad over salted. ˜My only issue was with the corn bread. ˜Served barely luke warm, a bit dry and dense and contained too many jalape?o's for my taste. ˜ Wait staff was attentive and friendly. ˜Only five blocks from home, I may just become a regular. ˜Thanks Morgans, for loving what you do and for bringing great BBQ to the neighborhood!!"
11074,3345,3,1,9/6/2014,"Came here with some friends, there is outdoor seating. We ordered a bunch of sandwiches and some sides since the menu stated that sides came with the sandwiches. Our check came and it turns out that you get sides for free only during the week... I am not sure why the waitress didn't let us know, she honestly could've cared less, she really just wanted the extra money. The food is decent, but I am not sure I can forgive poor service. Oh well, I won't be back."
11075,3345,4,1,9/2/2014,"I ate here for the first time about 4 months after they opened and have been a fan ever since. ˜All the staff and food I have encountered have been excellent. ˜My favorite foods are the fatty brisket, pork ribs, turkey and chicken. ˜They are ˜moist and delicious with no added sauce. ˜Collard greens and corn bread are my go to sides. ˜The collards have a little kick to them and the corn bread with the sweet cream butter is like a little dessert. ˜Other than these dishes I have only tried the mac n cheese which falls short for me, but aside from this side I have been a consistently happy customer. ˜Also, the el nino cocktail is a tasty drink if you're a fan of titos vodka and spice."
11076,3345,5,1,9/2/2014,"Food is delicious, cool atmosphere, great staff, delicious beer. Go with the pulled pork sandwich with Mac on the side"
11077,3345,3,1,9/1/2014,Brunch and sides are above average market price for the neighborhood but portion size would leave you content but not full. Their Texas french toast is amazing with granola crunchies. The fatty brisket is full of flavor but favorite remains BrisketTown until I get down to Texas or Mid-West. Cocktails are pretty good and wait-staff is attentive. Nice addition is outdoor dining via picnic benches. Will cime back for LUNCH and bourbon
11078,3345,4,1,8/30/2014,Stopped by randomly while I hung out in downtown Brooklyn. Awesome meaty ribs that were tender and fell off the bone. Mac and cheese was great and filling. Outdoor seating so we brought our dog and our waitress Isabella made our night with great service.
11079,3345,4,1,8/28/2014,Went there before the Arcade Fire show on the 22nd. They make a very good Margarita. I had the 1/4 lb. pulled pork and Chicken Tinga Mac. Awesome! Good service too even though the place was near full. Looking forward to a return visit.
11080,3345,5,1,8/24/2014,"I think this is my favorite BBQ place in the city, and I've tried most of them. ˜I lOVE their fatty brisket. ˜The corn in a cup is my favorite complementary side. ˜Wash everything down with a Shiner Bock and I promise you'll be satisfied!"
11081,3345,4,1,8/24/2014,"We arrived just after 4 and enjoyed a sidewalk table with an umbrella to protect us from a light shower. Great spot for people watching. We found out we couldn't order ribs until 5 so had a couple of beers with chips and a spicy cheese dip until dinner items could be ordered. The wait was worth it as the ribs were succulent, juicy, slide off the bones good. My son went for the jerk chicken Mac and cheese and said it was comparable to the best he's had. I also have to say the staff was very friendly and helpful."
11082,3345,1,1,8/21/2014,"Family's in town, got a bunch of mouths to feed. ˜Yelp says Morgan's delivers but Yelp is known to lie about such things so I call and ask, and they say yes, they deliver. ˜Great! ˜I'll call back with an order in 20 mins. ˜Great. Get the order together, call back, someone else answers the phone, ""Can I place an order for delivery?"". With an eye roll audible over the phone: ""Uh, we don't deliver"". ˜""I just called 20 minutes ago and asked if you delivered, you said yes"". ˜""It wasn't me who said that, we don't deliver"". ""Fine, someone else said you deliver"". ""Just a sec"" Line goes quiet, comes back on, attitude as if I should be grateful she bothered to not just hang up: ""Yeah, we're not going to deliver"". No apology for the misunderstanding, no offer to take a carry-out order, nothing. ˜I'm the jerk for still being on the phone. Not delivering is fine. Making a mistake and accidentally saying you deliver when you don't, that's not great but, really, that's fine, too. ˜Acting like an asshole is what earns a 1-star review."
11083,3345,3,1,8/17/2014,I guess im bias bc im not crazy about BBQ food and my dumb self shouldn't have went to a restaurant that specializes that BUUUUT that being said I tried a couple different Mac and cheeses and they were all very good. The drinks are watered down tho I just drank beer.
11084,3345,4,1,8/15/2014,The pulled pork melts in your mouth and the baked potato was perfect. ˜As was the lemonade.
11085,3345,3,1,8/10/2014,"I usually have the best experience food wise when I come here. That gets a 5. I had been twice in one week, and the service kind of turned me off, hence the 3. I went on a Saturday, had one waitress who was very explicit about the sodas being unlimited refills. When the check came, there were 2 sodas on the receipt. This happened to be a different waiter who had not been serving us from the beginning. This was baffling because the waiter who originally began with us was still working other tables. When I questioned the bill, the new waiter said she would ask a manager ˜and she came back with the additional soda off the check. I went back a few days later, and I had another negative experience with a different waitress. I ordered something that I had previously had, and she told me that it was impossible ˜for the chef to do when I had clearly ordered it in the past. ˜I just feel overall the staff can be a little bit more assertive."
9298,3345,3,1,8/9/2014,"I really love the ambiance of this place. Very casual and cozy, almost like being at a family barbecue. I ordered some Mac and cheese and it was pretty average. The brisket however was juicy,tender, and succulent. I would definitely go again, but will probably pass on the Mac and cheese"
11086,3345,5,1,8/8/2014,Everything was awesome! ˜Everything! ˜ The BBQ was amazing. ˜The sauce was delicious. ˜The ribs were succulent. ˜I would recommend the brisket for the true carnivore. ˜Staff was exemplary and I love the rustic decor. ˜Texas Tea paired perfectly with the meal. ˜I would totally go back. ˜ :::beep::: Dinosaur ˜BBQ! ˜Did I just say that!?!
11087,3345,5,1,8/7/2014,"Went to Morgan's for the the first time last night for dinner before the John Legend concert at the Barclay's Center. It was amazing! Sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table and it was fine. The bartender was super nice and fast. The pork ribs were outrageous, meat fell right off the bone. The fatty brisket was amazing as well. Also ordered the brisket tacos, but they were too spicy (my fault I didn't ask before ordering) and the corn bread. Now I am a cornbread lover but this one was not for me because it was made with peppers in it. Also had the mac-n-cheese side which was good. Had a beer, very light and smooth. Over all the food was great as was the service. The one thing that made it a 5 for me was I told the bartender that I didn't like the cornbread and that we couldn't eat the tacos because they were too spicy and they didn't charge us for it which I loved. Courtesy like that goes a very long way and it is definitely a very smart business move because it will keep customers coming back. Will definitely go back there again soon, definitely to get more ribs and want to try the pulled pork. Great place."
11088,3345,1,1,8/6/2014,"Bringing shame to the delivery game, since (at least) 2014! Morgan's does not know what they have available, which, as it turns out, is very little. It took them 20 minutes after my delivery order before they called to tell me that the 1st of 2 entrees we ordered - pork ribs - was not available . Ok, what about beef ribs? No? What about fatty brisket? No? Fine, I'll settle for the lean brisket (which I know from previous experience to be bland, but figured I'd drown it in bbq sauce). Then another 10 minutes before they call to tell me that the 2nd of 2 entrees we ordered - chicken - was unavailable. Giggles and a tepid apology from the other end of the phone. I'll probably go back because I'm weak willed and unprincipled. I may even order delivery again, because I make mistakes in my life. But it's not too late for you!"
9561,3345,3,1,8/6/2014,"So this place is pretty good. I ordered the Turkey sandwich after 5pm (meaning no complimentary side included). My date ordered the brisket and brisket tacos. Our waitress informed us they no longer had turkey so I got the 1/2 chicken. My chicken was flavorful and the bbq sauce was the bomb. Couldn't have made a sauce better myself. Only problem was, our meals were tepid at best. I usually like my food a bit hot when I order it at a restaurant. Our waitress was very attentive and kind. Although I personally didn't find this particular dining experience AMAZING, I feel that I got my money's worth. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood and want some decent bbq."
11089,3345,5,1,8/6/2014,"Quality barbecue food, absolutely worth what you pay for. Their brisket is probably the best i've had anywhere."
11090,3345,4,1,8/5/2014,"To all of my vegan comrades out there: I know you have friends who love BBQ. I know you basically never go out with anyone that eats meat these days for a variety of reasons. But if you're like me and just want to spend time with your friends over a meal, you can handle this BBQ joint with the aid of their absolutely DELICIOUS vegan mac and cheese. This is where I am going to bring all of my meat eating friends who want BBQ just so I can eat that mac & cheese again. It's really heavy/comfort food style with nacho strips, bread crumbs (?) and jalepe?os on it, so you really don't need to invest in the 2 other vegan options (which are both sides, the collard greens and the beans.) So vegans, go eat that mac & cheese and indulge in the irony that is being a vegan dining at a BBQ restaurant."
11091,3345,4,1,8/2/2014,"First time I went to Morgan's a friend and I sat at the bar. ˜Bartender was great. ˜My friend and I thought the BBQ was was delicious, and she's a harsh critic from Austin. ˜(Turns out one of the pit masters was from Austin as well, and certainly knows what he's doing.) ˜Somehow we managed to close the place, have great whiskey, and meet some of the great staff at this place. ˜I've been back since, and still find it to be an open air, good vibe, great place with arguably the best BBQ in Brooklyn and NYC."
11092,3345,3,1,7/31/2014,"Nice outdoor area right on Flatbush ave. I tried the brisket, both lean and fatty, which were underwhelming. ˜The brisket was very salty and not melt-in-your-mouth delicious as I've had in other establishments in Brooklyn. The pulled pork sandwich was subpar and expensive for the size (looked like a slider). Drinks were also overpriced and came in small mason jars for the same price you would pay at a bar for a pint of their finest beer. Overall, I came here for the experience and am unlikely to return. 3 stars for the ambiance, good service, and beer selection (which complemented the brisket perfectly)."
11093,3345,5,1,7/26/2014,"Walking home from the Atlantic center and I got sacked by the smell. ˜Ribs, brisket, ˜pulled pork and beer...yummy. greeted at the and we were seated in about 5 mins. ˜ We were seated in Janice's section she was lightening quick and laughed at my jokes..so in my book she scores an A+ in my server rating. ˜Food was great and the beer was cold. ˜Perfect."
8829,3345,3,1,7/26/2014,"Dry ass brisket! Save your money and your hunger for Mighty Quinn's or Fette Sau. I gave this place an honest shake and left disappointed. I tried both types of brisket, sausage, slaw, greens and the queso. Best part of the meal was the bourbon sweet tea."
11094,3345,1,1,7/25/2014,"My waiter Jen is extremely nice and a Darling. Her coconut smile is heart warming ( Present tense as I am sitting here writing this review as I take in the ambiance of Flatbush Avenue and a sea of taxi drivers who I presently envy as they have not been subjected to the ribs and brisket that they are obviously avoiding) SALT SALT SALT SALT SALT SALT SALT I am convinced that the chef was hypnotized and told to load as much salt he possibly can in the four ribs and brisket I had. My SALT quota for the next 3 months have been achieved. I had the pork ribs, brisket, Cole slaw and potato salad. The cole slaw was good at best and after one taste of the potato salad I quickly grab my Angry Orchid hard Cider to wash away the taste of disappointment. ˜ A client recommended this place and not only does he owe me a full refund but also and hand written apology. As dawn breaks into day, I am seeking the attention of the nearest Doctor to check my salt intake."
11095,3345,5,1,7/25/2014,"Can't say enough good things about Morgan's. ˜Definitely is my go to spot in the neighborhood. ˜The BBQ there is fantastic, which for any type of a commercial type establishment is hard to pull off. ˜ The staff is nice. ˜The drinks are good and cold. ˜I love that you can sit outside and the front also opens up so it feels like you're outside."
11096,3345,5,1,7/23/2014,Definitely reasonably price. Make sure you let the server explain to you how it works because I went there and had a late lunch with a friend. We got a pound of brisket to share and a Mac an cheese from the other menu to share as well. A pound is def enough to share but if you guys are hungry it'll hit the spot. So get a pound each. The brisket was tasteful and had enough flavor. Make sure to put some BBQ sauce it makes it taste even better. And for the meat lovers forget about the lean meat get it with fat!!!!!The drinks are good as well. I believe they have a full bar. Overall I'd go again!!!
11097,3345,2,1,7/22/2014,"If you know good BBQ, don't go here. (If you have no sense for BBQ, you will probably like it so go here.) We had the brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs, cornbread and collard greens. The meat was not flavorful at all. It tasted like some generic, big-chain BBQ. The pork ribs were not tender, fall off the bone. We didn't even finish the collard greens, which was just overly vinegary. Cornbread was probably the best out of them all, but that can only do you so much at this point... PASS!"
11098,3345,4,1,7/21/2014,"I randomly walked into this place with my boyfriend and I must say we were impressed. The food was definitely delicious and the corn bread was amazing! I do have to agree with everyone else, the portions suck and are overpriced. However, you are getting delicious food and it's worth every dollar. The best part of the meal was the cornbread and the ribs, don't miss out on those. The girls are really nice and very pretty, some eye candy there for the guys."
11099,3345,3,1,7/21/2014,"Food was a 3.5, Ambiance was a 3.5 (for a BBQ place) and the service was a 0.5 The food was actually pretty good. I'm not much a of a BBQ aficianado but this place was pretty damn good to me. ˜Loved that the Elbow Room menu is integrated. ˜The mac n cheese at the Elbow Room is really good and a perfect, creamy compliment to the peppery bbq served up here. ˜For sides, we had the corn salad, which was awesome, the pinto beans were exceptional. ˜For meat we had the lean Brisket, peppery, dry and tasty, the Pulled Pork, my wife's favorite here, and some ribs which were also very peppers but very tasty. ˜The BBQ sauce they make is PERFECT as an accompaniment to the bbq flavors they use. The service was horrific. ˜Two hostesses who had no idea how long the wait was or where they could seat people. Seemingly an endless number of servers and bussers milling around without talking to patrons and mostly just drinking juice in the back with each other. ˜Took about 15 minutes to get waited on (I'm talking about getting water and anyone to say ""hi""). To avoid the horrendous service I would recommend sitting at the bar because the bartenders there work their asses off and, as a result, will give you good service."
11100,3345,5,1,7/16/2014,"Omg all I can say is hmm hmm good!!. I went with the recommendation of the beef ribs, also added brisket, pork ribs, ˜potato salad, collard greens and stuffed sweet potato. .. First let me state that this is hands down the best BbQ in NYC outside of Texas. . The best way to judge good bbq is by the brisket and boy did they serve that pretty darn good if you ask me.. I wasnt a fan of having to pay extra for onions, pickles and ˜jalepenos, (the texas way, and no im not from texas lol but i know my food) but it wasn't a complete deal breaker. . The ribs was seasoned very very well and tender not over cooked or dried out.. the sides was delish except for the potato salad that was a no go! Didnt look right nor did it taste right.. the sweet potato delish the bbq sauce delish and the ribs didnt need it in my opinion. .."
11101,3345,5,1,7/6/2014,"Hey, people, I'm a vegetarian and this place is Grrrrrrrrrreat! ˜Hanging out in New York for a week and wanting my husband to enjoy some culinary pleasure, we slipped out of the hot sun and into Morgan's. We were immediately welcomed and began exploring the do-it-yerself menu. A cook stretching his legs recommended the fatty brisket, not ironically. There are 10 kinds of mac and cheese. 10! ˜I ordered the Big Ole Salad, which was perfectly fresh, lightly dressed with a unique pickled peanut sauce, and a baked potato. My husband almost cried when he bit into the brisket, which he confirms is from heaven. Our waitress, who was friendly and attentive, laughed when he ordered a second round of brisket, and acknowledged that she is an angel from heaven bringing him the food of the gods. Get a jalape?o ni?o or two like me! But definitely go. Vegetarians, do not be dismayed: you will find deliciousness and your meat-eating friends will praise your name."
11102,3345,5,1,7/6/2014,"Fantastic fatty brisket!!! I am a life long lover of BBQ and everything I ate here, potato salad, collard greens, big ole salad, brisket and beef ribs...AMAZING!"
11103,3345,4,1,6/28/2014,"Loved this! At first I was hesitant because of the hipster font and hipster-style menu...but, after putting that behind me, I LOVED IT! My friends and I sat on the benches outside and ordered a variety of food and everything was excellent and authentically BBQed flavored. Coleslaw, baked beans, potato salad, brisket, and pork...mmm! They had one BBQ sauce on the table which I liked over the 7-8-9 BBQ sauces that some places put on the table...too many to choose from and then the flavors are blended and take away from the food. The drinks are total HIPSTER! Ironically gin-based...they were tasty but there wasn't much variety. Suggestions: throw on a white sangria, fruit-based drink, or a frozen drink machine and this place will be 5 STARS! There's no reason to have ALL gin drinks...stick to 1 or 2 in my opinion. **The server we had was uninterested and not really involved. She had red streaks in her hair and may have been having a bad day. Leave that stuff at home and fake it til you make it.** :) -Eddie Going"
11104,3345,3,1,6/27/2014,"Food quality: good. I'm originally from the South and quality-wise, I think this place could actually survive and do well in bbq country. The brisket is very moist, ribs were tender and came off the bone with some ease. The corn bread with pepper jelly also stands out. The main problem with this place, and why I probably won't go again, is that it's just way to expensive for the small portions. I came with a group of 6, and when they set down our food in those tiny little paper trays, it was just the saddest thing I'd ever seen. Also, the sides come in two sizes, and the larger one was termed ""for the neighborhood."" Since we had a group, we obviously opted for that size. My memory might be failing me, but it came in a cup the size of a small cup of ice cream. Definitely felt a bit sacrilegious for a place that flies the TX flag in front. ˜ If you want to try BBQ in Brooklyn, Dino's is not far away and personally, I think it's a far superior choice."
11105,3345,5,1,6/21/2014,"Wow, awesome good!! Loved it and totally eat to much but was soooo yummy! ˜Friends tell me it's a great place for brunch too, I will have to try that after enjoying the awesome BBQ dinner."
11106,3345,5,1,6/19/2014,Just love it !! Not to fond of the sides except the mac & cheese &cornbread but everything else amazing!!
9412,3345,5,1,6/12/2014,"There really and truly is no better barbecue place in NYC. ˜If my opinion changes, I will gladly update this review (because it would mean I found more awesome barbecue). ˜But let me be clear: ˜Mighty Quinn's, Hill Country, Dino -- all fine and dandy, but Morgan's is on another level. The fatty brisket is probably the best brisket I have had anywhere, period. ˜Perfectly moist and full of beef flavor without being overwhelmingly fatty. ˜Beef sausage: up there with some of the best places you can find in Texas. ˜The pulled pork is just right too, peppery and salty (which seems to be their approach to barbecue in general, lay on good quality salt and pepper to cook, and let the customer handle the saucing.) ˜If there's a weakness it might be the ribs -- but I'm not a huge rib guy anyway, so I'll let it slide. And ohhhh the sides. ˜I could eat the roasted corn with cheese and lime every day. ˜Add in great smoky pintos and collards, and you have a complete meal. (Kind of.) Drinks are a plus too, great selection of bourbon and beer, as a barbecue place should have. ˜I haven't had a dessert yet, and I doubt I will, since I would rarely leave room willingly. ˜And now that the outdoor seating is open, it's a heckuva lot easier to get seated, and you can enjoy your food on sunny picnic benches watching the foot traffic on Flatbush. ˜Whatever Morgan's is doing, I hope they keep doing it."
11107,3345,5,1,6/12/2014,"Simply great smoked style BBQ. ˜Fatty brisket is a winner. ˜Cold slaw and brisket tacos also very yummy. Friendly staff, tasty drinks and nice patio outdoor space weather permitting. ˜Kid friendly and reasonably priced."
11108,3345,2,1,6/3/2014,"I often write verbose reviews, however that is not required in this instance: Pair appalling management, dreadful service and woefully mediocre food and you have a recipe for disaster. The premise is not bad, in theory: A restaurant with a large outdoor seating area on Flatbush serving familiar barbecue favorites? Sounds good to me. The problems, however, begin when you walk through the door whereupon the host put us to the side and helped three other groups of people before seating us. The service was slow (several groups that arrived well after us, received their food before us) and the ambiance...well there was none to speak of. The food itself was abysmal when compared to places like Fette Sau and Mighty Quinn's -- completely different leagues. The brisket was dry and barely edible, the pulled pork was really mediocre. Have you had the pulled pork sandwich from Juniper? Compare the two products and get back to me. The mac and cheese from The Elbow Room was the best thing we ate, by a considerable margin, though it wasn't spectacular and it certainly wasn't schlepp-worthy, considering the price for a rather small portion. Conclusion: As far as barbecue goes, all one expects is honest to goodness flavorful and tender meat. Morgan's Barbecue failed to deliver in that regard. With music blaring at obnoxious levels, service that leaves plenty to be desired and food that falls short of its competitors, one should hop on the train and dash to a purveyor of consistently good fare."
11109,3345,5,1,6/2/2014,"I went there last weekend. Great atmosphere, friendly staff and incredible food. ˜I had a fully loaded baked potato and the collared greens. ˜Both were off the charts good. ˜Towards the end of of our evening there, I think they let one of their friends be a ""guest bartender."" ˜He didn't really know where anything was, but was incredibly nice and talked us into another round. ˜And we liked that that's the type of place it is, you know? ˜We also liked how a lot of the staff hangs out after their shifts end... pretty good sign that it's a cool place to be. ˜I mean, when I'm off at my work, I'm OUT OF THERE!! ˜Oh, and their whiskey selection is pretty decent. ˜It could benefit from a few extra top-shelf options, but it's a barbecue place, so I'm not taking a star away for that. ˜Great family place, too. People of all sorts. ˜I'll be back very soon."
11110,3345,4,1,6/1/2014,"We ordered brisket, ribs, Jamaican jerk mac and cheese and baked potatoes. The ribs was so tasty and we didn't even need knives. Brisket was so good. The seasoning was on point and melted in my mouth. But the Jamaican jerk wasn't good at all. They had pineapple on it which I don't know why, it ˜was just terrible. It needed to be in the oven for 10 more minutes, more cheese and the jerk chicken needed seasoning just a cup of hot mess."
11111,3345,4,1,5/30/2014,"Great food --- some of the best ribs I ever had. Quick to the table as well. Friday lunch and place was moderately busy, walked right and and say down - waitress had my order within minutes --- Highly reccomended !!!"
11112,3345,3,1,5/29/2014,"Went here on the Sunday of Memorial Day to sit at the bar and was greeted, or should I say not greeted, by the ""worlds worst bartender"" (a man with a huge beard) as he called himself. ˜After waiting for about 10 minutes and realizing the bartender did not care to make eye contact or acknowledge me I got up and asked the host for 2 menus. Only then did the bartender realize that we weren't the same people who were sitting there before. Simple enough mistake, I was willing to let it go. We asked what was better, pork or brisket and the bartender just walked away not saying anything and came back to tell us he had to try the brisket and said they were both good, very helpful thanks. ˜We ended up ordering the fatty brisket, pulled pork tacos and the Caribbean chicken mac and cheese (can't remember the official name of it) along with two drinks. ˜My boyfriend got his beer right away, after waiting about 15 minutes I finally asked about my cocktail and realized he just forgot about it. ˜The drink was strong and not very tasty, it was the whiskey and tea option, once again can't remember the exact name. In the mean time I tried to get water for us and that took awhile too. The food finally came and thank god... it was delicious!! The fatty brisket was full of flavor and their BBQ sauce is everything a girl could want. ˜The tacos were by far the best thing we ordered! The pulled pork with the guac and other toppings were PERFECT!! I could eat 10 of those in one sitting. The mac and cheese was hard to eat, the flavor profiles didn't really go well together and honestly it was hard to finish. Also important to note that this is all very messy and trying to get extra napkins from the bartender was like pulling teeth. It then took us FOREVER to get our check and by the time we left I was so angry with the service I almost forgot how good the food was. ˜If you go I would stay FAR away from the big bearded bartender, he really is the WORST bartender I have ever had."
11113,3345,2,1,5/29/2014,"My main issue with Morgan's was the dick of a bartender; 3 friends and I went on a Wednesday night and had to wait for a four top to open up. Looking around I realized three sets of couples were sat at a four top while as many two-person tables were wide open. The manager asked us not to wait in the entryway, so we stood ˜crowded around one of the two tops near the bar since there were no stools open. When my friend went to order drinks, the bartender wouldn't serve is because we were ""at a table."" False. One of the waitresses finally came over to our ""table"" and took our drink order. The drinks were pretty decent--had the Texas Tea (sweet tea and bourbon)--nothing spectacular but fine enough. After we were sat, we ordered another round of drinks. This time I could not taste even a hint of bourbon. It was like drinking a glass of straight sweet tea that a southern grandma would serve you on a hot afternoon. Tasty, but if I'm shelling out ten bucks per drink, is it so much to ask for some actual alcohol? I asked the waitress to see if the bartender somehow forgot the bourbon (it was seriously THAT weak) and she checked with him. His response? ""She probably got a strong one last time and can pay for a double if she wants more."" Really, dude? You can't admit you made a weak-ass drink and pour an extra finger of bourbon? Cheap as hell. The food was alright. Mac and cheese was the star of the show, but that's not even Morgan's--it comes from Elbow Room next door. If you're looking for legit BBQ, head to Dinosaur on Union."
11114,3345,2,1,5/28/2014,This is a pretty soulless corporate BBQ place. The manager was quite rude when we came and just wanted a drink. When we late ordered food she was not happier. I appreciate that the ethos is that people may share those wooden benches but an acknowledgment from the waitstaff that another couple is now going to be sitting next to you would be nice. ˜Won't be going back.
11115,3345,4,1,5/28/2014,"Went here on Memorial Day with my girlfriend and we were both blown away. ˜Great selection of beer and specialty cocktails. $5 Modello? Beautiful. ˜Incredible bourbon collection as well, the Rebel Yell ($7) was great. ˜Super fast service, pulled pork was delicious. ˜I think the brisket baked potato was my favorite. ˜Pork ribs were killer as well. ˜We sat down at 1pm and they were out of chicken...which is a good thing! I know I know, ""liek omg they r out of chix! so lame! dis place sux"" This means they are busy! You don't want to go to the place that has their product sitting around for days. ˜It's a barbecue joint anyway, I want brisket and pork, I'll get the chicken next time. I love places that really take the time to get their food right and they take the time to do everything the right way. ˜I will definitely be back."
11116,3345,2,1,5/26/2014,"*sigh* I really really wanted to like this place because I am a Texan and I have faith in all things Texas BUT I just didn't. When I arrived I ordered an ice tea, just tea and it took over 15 mins for my tea because I guess they were washing cups? That rubbed me the wrong way but I thought no biggie. We ordered Chips and Queso as an appetizer and the Queso was soooooo bland, nothing like the Queso at home, it lacked flavor, it was thinner than what I'm used to, just a failed attempt at the dish. For my main dish I ordered a loaded baked potato stuffed with brisket because at home it's a delicious dish and I was so happy they had it. It was such a disappointment, the potato was small, just regular sized and it was undercooked, the inside was pretty firm, it lacked in the amount of butter and cheese, and the brisket was very subpar. Usually, this particular dish is served and the potato is basically falling apart because of all of the butter and cheese being melted by the hot meat in an already hot potato, it's usually pretty epic but not here. I don't want to give up on the place because I am a Texan and I believe in all things Texas. I'll probably give them another chance but I was just not impressed.... At all."
11117,3345,4,1,5/24/2014,Must try the pork ribs! Amazing!!! They even have all the macaroni's from elbow room here!
11118,3345,5,1,5/24/2014,"my son took me to dinner to the place of my choice....i said morgans...........great choice.we had queso chips to start,some shots,beer...then pork ribs,fatty brisket,and chicken.............great company,and vibe.....dont forget the pecan pie and brownie and cream................will be back again and again................"
11119,3345,5,1,5/23/2014,"Best all around BBQ in the city right now. You know you found a BBQ spot when the chicken, which is usually a side thought for many of these place is AMAZING."
11120,3345,5,1,5/18/2014,Great Barbecue! Love their macaroni & cheese specialties
11121,3345,5,1,5/18/2014,"Dropped by here yesterday since we've been wanting to try this place out for some time now - really glad we did. I'm no BBQ expert, but this was some of the tastiest stuff I've eaten in a long time. We had the fatty brisket, turkey, pork sausage, pork ribs, big ole salad, Texas two step (bourbon drink) and a jalape?o vodka drink. Everything tasted great! I don't know how long they smoke their meat, but everything was really tender and full of flavor. We'll definitely be going back there to try their other menu items (plus I thought it was very reasonably priced). If you haven't tried it out, I'd definitely suggest it. Just be aware that you can only get sandwiches and sides until 5pm - the full menu starts after 5 (at least on Saturdays, not sure about any other day)."
11122,3345,4,1,5/14/2014,"I've passed by this place a million times, smiled at the thought of BBQ coupled with a bit of macaroni and cheese from the Elbow Room and then continued to walk on by. Things changed one spring Tuesday evening night after enjoying a few cocktails in the neighborhood and craving a meal of substance that would help to counter the effects of alcohol. Sounds like a BBQ night to me. We ordered the brisket, 1/2 chicken and Mac n' cheese. I finished it all. I preferred the brisket most, but it was all good. The meat was sooooo tender, sauce was perfect, great music in the background and staff made me smile. I think we found a winner. Can't wait until the weather is consistently nice and I can actually sit outside and dine."
11123,3345,4,1,5/11/2014,"Awesome BBQ and mac and cheese here! As someone who goes to school in NC I very much enjoyed the ribs, fatty brisket, and pulled pork (their BBQ sauce is excellent as well). Also some really cool mac and cheese flavors (we had the original but still great) and a good variety of sides/desserts. Pecan pie was also delicious!"
11124,3345,5,1,5/7/2014,"A trip to Prospect Park planned but in need of a rest, food and drink first. Wandered down Flatbush Ave and found this place. Nice and open with inviting vibes. We were not disappointed. The beer served in jars was quaint and the food was wholesome and reasonable value. Worth a visit if in this area."
9326,3345,3,1,5/2/2014,"I thought the queso and chips would be like nacho-like chips but it's chips with the queso on the side. It was delicious, and I added the pulled pork. Overall, ok appetizer. The fatty brisket is good. I don't think it was super special, but enough to satisfy my BBQ craving. The corn bread could have come out warm, and the butter was too hard from being cold. Corn bread has a lot of flavor and things added inside. It was a good portion for $3. They had an issue with the taps, and beers took a while to arrive. Service was good. We could have gotten an update instead of having to ask twice where our beers were."
11125,3345,4,1,4/29/2014,"If there is one thing I love from the South, it is their sides. I ordered my two favorite sides, potato salad and cole slaw, with low expectations as the North often does not deliver with them. Boy, was I in for a pleasant surprise! The potato salad is slightly orange from paprika but don't be scurred! It's packed with flavor and crunch. This isn't one of those bland recipes with nothing but mayo and potato and pepper, my friend. No, no, there ain't no going skimpy here. It's loaded with colorful veggies AS IT SHOULD BE. The coleslaw was also very delightful. It is fresh and crunchy. It doesn't feel or taste like it's been soaked in mayonnaise for days on end. It's very refreshing in your mouth, making a great contrast with your bbq. On to the meat: the pork ribs had enough fat on them & were decently cooked. The ""fatty"" brisket may have been fatty once but must have been all cooked away as it came out very dry. They're cooked dry rubbed, but the BBQ sauce (only one option) wasn't that great. I prefer a very sweet flavor. It'd be nice to have that option."
11126,3345,5,1,4/28/2014,"Best BBQ in Brooklyn, hands down. No competition. I feel so strongly about this, that I am literally writing the review while I sit here. We had the brisket, pulled pork, beef sausage, beef tacos, jerk Mac n cheese, and chili. The tacos were a mistake, but the owner gave them to us any way and I most say I'm glad he did. ˜We couldn't even get through half of our meal because we ordered enough for a small army, but I'm excited about my leftovers. The brisket is indescribable really...come eat it for yourself. Oh and no sauce needed, but it is tasty if you are in to that. The chili is probably some of the best I've ever had. I could go on, but I won't. Everything is AMAZING. The owner actually asked us if we wanted to move because a more comfortable seat had opened up. How considerate is that? Great bar menu. I can't say enough nice things. We will definitely be back. Awesome edition to the area. Bravo."
11127,3345,5,1,4/28/2014,Amazing!! Thanks Justin for making the best drinks!!! Also thanks for recommending the buffalo chicken Mac & Cheese!!! Amazing. I would have added a picture but I ate my food to fast!!!
11128,3345,1,1,4/22/2014,"I tried, twice, to like this place. The first time was within a week of opening - they were out of items on the menu (brisket), the service was poor, and the wine had a strange flavor. I decided that I would give it another shot today, since it was a great day to sit outside in the sun...bad choice. I can't speak to the food quality or quantity as we were seated, given menus, and not spoken to again. We sat for 15 minutes just waiting...for water, or silverware, or someone to take our drink order...nothing! ˜Note that this was 130pm on a Tuesday, and there were probably only 15-20 other patrons dining. After being ignored, we walked out. I'm done with this place...there are way too many delicious options within a few blocks."
11129,3345,5,1,4/20/2014,"This place awesome! I can't believe I hadn't been here prior, I live right by the place. Will be coming back often for sure. The brisket is I think the best brisket I've had in NYC, and I've been to most of the BBQ spots in the city. The Mac and cheese is ofcourse other worldly, it's the same guy who owns elbow room in Barclays. Had the collards which were also excellent. And the corn, make sure you squeeze the lime on the corn, its crazy good. My new favorite spot in the neighborhood for sure. Easy five stars."
11130,3345,5,1,4/16/2014,"I've been here 3-4 times, and the pork ribs are just insanely good (though I question whether you're really getting a ""pound"" for $12, it's still good value relative to other mediocre BBQ places in the hood. Everything else is good- other meats, sides, bar options, service, etc... Just don't understand why Dinosaur is so crowded when Morgan's is better by 7,000 sausage links."
11131,3345,4,1,4/16/2014,"I feel like there hasn't been enough press/talk about this place. ˜Apparently it's been around for a little while before I finally stumbled upon it. ˜ I loooove bbq, who doesn't? ˜Any place I travel, I try to find the best ones. ˜I'm not some expert who can tell you what makes the best bbq, but you just know good food when you have it. ˜ I think this place does everything pretty darned well, given we're in the northeast and not south or midwest. 1 star for nice selection of good beers and huge selection of bourbon 1 star for consistently great service every time I've gone, even when busy and with my kids. ˜I love that they're accomodating to kids. ˜Parents, just please keep your kids in control...its a restaurant not a playground. 1 star for the decor/ambience. ˜not over the top cheesy or trying to hard, just warm and comfortable and a varied layout, you can sit outside, in the front brightly lit area, or the back which is darker (my preference) 1 star for solid food. ˜We've eaten our way through the menu and there wasn't one dud item. ˜I've had better brisket, but this one is still good. ˜The chili is the only item that maybe was below expectations in that it was soupy , not full of beans, but with big chunks of meat. ˜Maybe that's what ""Texas Chili"" is? ˜The corn, sooooo good with salsa verde!"
11132,3345,3,1,4/15/2014,"It seems the quality went downhill a little. ˜I originally gave it 5 stars, but after the last couple of experiences, the brisket was nowhere near as good as it once was, i.e., the moist cuts were pretty dry. ˜Unfortunately I can't say this place is as consistent as I thought it was, but I do like the vibe and will eventually make my way over here again."
11133,3345,3,1,4/12/2014,So not sure about all the rave reviews. Respectable enough but with all the great choices in Brooklyn it won't be a repeat for me. ˜If you're looking for a great pulled pork sandwich ( no frills ) head to the Brooklyn ice house in red hook... 2 for $5.
11134,3345,4,1,4/10/2014,"freakin' delicious...nothing to complain about here (except the space is a little cramped...but par for the course with restaurants in this neighborhood.) ˜ The meat is moist and smoky, just the way I like it. ˜The host and waitress were great and made the long wait for a table bearable."
11135,3345,5,1,4/8/2014,"If you like fall off the bone, melt in your mouth bbq ribs...these are the best ribs in NYC. ˜Period. ˜But wait...there's more! Awesome pulled pork, definitely among the best in the area, tender flavorful tasting moist brisket (though I prefer it to be sliced, this was a kind of pulled/sliced combo?) that I thought had plenty of ""fatty"" for those who read the other reviews that opined otherwise. ˜Also probably top 5 in NYC. ˜The classic Elbow Room mac & cheese, collards, and roasted corn were all great. ˜Others liked the special Buffalo mac better than I did, but I don't especially love blue cheese, which was ˜a big flavor. ˜Also had a biscuit and mushroom gravy with brunch; loved the gravy, thought the biscuit could have been a bit thicker, and the grits were super tasty but a little more runny than I would make for myself. I didn't have the pleasure of the long lines I've heard about when I went on Saturday at 1pm, but I don't really feel like I missed out by getting a table right away."
11136,3345,3,1,4/6/2014,"Delicious. We had brisket, sausage and turkey. Turkey was amazing--tender and peppery. For sides we had coleslaw which was fresh and crunchy, green bean casserole which was super good a d creamy and hamburger mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was just okay. I would try another flavor if we went back though. However, the environment was a little chaotic. The music was VERY loud. Too loud to hear the person I was dining with and it made our stay less comfortable than it should have been. It's a shame because while it was good music it radically reduced the comfortable atmosphere. Plus, there seemed to be some confusion about who our waitress was and we had one express some annoyance that someone else had taken our order. And then we had to ask for drinks multiple times since they never came. Waitstaff also didn't treat customers very well when navigating the restaurant- bathing past, knocking into to people, etc. just a little courtesy and welcome would go a long way. This place deserves four stars for food but I am giving them three because of the blaring music and chaos."
11137,3345,4,1,3/28/2014,"Wow! This is the first time I'm writing a review on yelp solely for the service. ˜Food was good enough. Started at the bar, great drinks, cute blonde bartender. Moved to table, Rebecca was amazing and funny. Brisket was solid. Def coming back"
11138,3345,5,1,3/24/2014,"I've been here about 20 times since they opened. My wife and I did a Texas BBQ honeymoon in hill country around Austin. Every time I came, the BBQ was better and better (starting from a good place). At its best, the brisket was better than all but that we found at Franklin and LA Barbecue in Austin. Not coincidentally, when Franklin opened, the three pitmasters were Aaron Franklin, John Lewis (of LA Barbecue) and Morgans' pitmaster, John Avila. As we kept coming to Morgan's the brisket and pulled pork especially got better and better. But starting a few months ago, the fatty brisket started feeling awfully lean. The very friendly manager told us that the organic/grass fed source for their beef was trimming the briskets of fat before delivery, and that was affecting the fatty brisket. It is still delicious, and they seem to be compensating with an abundance of black pepper. Still very good, but a pale shadow of what it had grown to be. Hopefully they can fix their sourcing and go back to a less peppery (but still peppery) recipe. As a result, the pulled pork is now the best meat on the menu. Super juicy, very flavorful, and with a hint of red pepper flake. Easily the best pulled pork in NYC, and yes, I've had them all. When the brisket was at its best, it was also the best in town, but sadly that hasn't been the case recently. The pork ribs are also terrific, among the best in NYC, if not the very best. The turkey tails are a great alternative to buffalo wings, and a unique culinary experience as far as I've ever had. The mac (Morgan's, never had the Elbow Room) is very good. Not nearly the best in the area, but very reliably good. I wasn't a fan of the cornbread, but I've enjoyed most of the other sides. Baked potatoes are very rudimentary and feel mostly microwaved with an oven finish, but they do the job. I wish they had fries, as I bet they'd nail them. Service is almost always a little problematic. Just little things, often with the check, and always resolved to our satisfaction. So why five stars, given these reservations? Because the meat, (pulled pork and ribs always, and especially the brisket when it is at its best) is simply the best you can get outside of Texas for this style of BBQ. Ignore people complaining about the sauce: proper Texas BBQ needs no sauce, and is flavored by the meat, the smoke, and the seasonings alone. I hope they can right their course with the fatty brisket, because when it was at its best, it was truly something special. Check them out, come hungry, and try everything that appeals. You won't regret it!"
11139,3345,4,1,3/22/2014,"Great food, great service, excellent bourbon selection. ˜I cannot wait to go there in the summer and sit outside."
11140,3345,5,1,3/12/2014,"If you want great BBQ and a Texas Two Step then come on down! Their Mac n cheese is also incredible. Great atmosphere, great food and great bourbon! Prices are a little high but you get your money's worth."
11141,3345,1,1,3/8/2014,"This low rate is not for the food but based on a bunch of miscommunications. I stopped by today by 4 pm with my family. After we placed our order and got our drinks, we have been told that they had no more brisket, we changed our order and the waitress came back to inform us that they were out of meat till 5pm, only sides were available. We decided to finish our fritos pie (without silverware, cause they were out of it as well at this time!). Before we leave my son ordered a key lime pie to go. We realized on time that our waitress mixed up another fritos pie with the key lime we ordered. She took the bag to fix the mistake and brought it back to the table. Unfortunately my son realized once we get home that he was still missing his pie :-( Unpleasant experience at Morgan's barbecue which left us a bitter feeling"
9336,3345,5,1,3/3/2014,"Went on a Saturday night with 2 friends and only waited 20 minutes for a table. Everyone was really friendly and helpful, and the food was awesome. Sides weren't anything too special, but the meat, especially the beef rib, was some of the best barbecue I've ever had. Very reasonable prices, too! I can't believe it took me this long to try this place, I'll definitely be back."
11142,3345,5,1,2/27/2014,"NYC's BEST BBQ! I've tried almost every spot, outside of Fette Sau. Morgan's tops my list hands down... I've been to Franklin BBQ in Austin and this is comparable for sure. Can't wait to go back and try the pork ribs (which they were out of last time)"
11143,3345,4,1,2/26/2014,"I've been consistently pleased with my dining experiences at Morgan's - I often recommend it to friends for food or drinks before events at the Barclays Center. I've been seated in the main restaurant, in the bar section up front, and at the bar itself. The service has been about average, to slightly better than expected. The seating in the back is a bit crowded/cramped, but the front section can be chilly near the door this time of year. On to the food - highlights include the brisket and pork ribs. The pulled pork is also solid, and the turkey tails is a sadly overlooked menu item that I would recommend trying - what's not mentioned on the menu is a tasty buffalo-style flavor in the glaze. Another favorite has been the Stuffed Baked Potato, with your choice of pulled pork or beef brisket. I've never tried any of the sandwiches (I'd rather fill up on meat than bread). The sides are mostly solid across the board - for me the only true lowlight is the macaroni and cheese, which is outsourced to their neighbors at Elbow Room nextdoor. They offer several types of mac & cheese, none of which have a strong enough cheese flavor - sometimes the pasta is also too mushy. Skip this, order more meat instead. Or try the beans, the greens, or the chili. Also, I have to mention this - after all my experiences I can honestly say that the most obvious criticism I have for Morgan's is their DISAPPOINTING BARBECUE SAUCE. It's the only consistently unsatisfying part of my experiences - to me it tastes sweet, with Asian influences (ginger, plum). If you could BYO sauce, you'd be set (in fact I may eventually push my luck and resort to this - or just start ordering takeout). Tip - check the bar for happy hour tacos and beers! I would go here just to get a drink - they have a great whiskey list (particularly American), solid cocktail and beer lists, and good Happy Hour specials on beers and tacos."
11144,3345,2,1,2/24/2014,"I loved my first time here, but it got progressively worse, service-but more specifically the brisket. ˜They were serving me lean brisket and trying to call it fatty. ˜Once is bad enough, but two separate times? ˜Why? ˜Dishonesty? ˜Stupidity? ˜Laziness of the cook? ˜Such a shame, because when it's good here it's outstanding! ˜But I don't have time for inconsistency like this."
11145,3345,3,1,2/24/2014,"It seems that every now and then, I'll need a reminder that, as a 105 lb. girl, my stomach, unfortunately. has limits; and that I will definitely not feel well after eating three pork ribs, nearly 1/2 lb of brisket, biscuits and gravy, and cornbread. And that mac and cheese? Forget about it. (For all you skeptics thinking, ""What? You call that a lot of food? You eat like my baby sister!"" Well, I applaud you and the black holes you call your stomachs.) But everyone has a vice, and mine is obviously gluttony, and what better way to ""feed"" that vice, than indulging on some barbecue. So after eating probably two lbs. of food, I guess I should say a few words about it. First of all, from the outside of the restaurant, it seems that Morgan's is right next to Elbow Room, which sells mac and cheese. Once you're inside, the two restaurants will have merged into one - you get both menus and you can order from both on one check. This is great if you intend to order mac and cheese and want a wider variety to choose from. The highlight of the meal was definitely the pork ribs. The meat was smoky, juicy, and just tender enough to fall of the bone with a slight tug, without falling apart. The cornbread - standard, but not the best. I generally find that places err on the side of dryness, but Morgan's is actually a little too moist - perhaps because of the pepper jelly. It seemed more like pound cake than it did corn bread. However, the pepper bits inside do make it somewhat different from your standard cornbread. The fatty brisket was decent as well. My only criticism is that a big portion of it seemed more lean than fat, and not very juicy. I definitely needed a good dousing of barbecue sauce with each bite. Other than that, it was smoky and well-seasoned. For anyone who has had biscuits and (sausage) gravy before, and for anyone who has an expectation for a thick, creamy, slightly spicy, meaty, and hot gravy, I would shy away from this one. This one was a little too thick; it was warm at best; and had but a few tiny crumbs of sausage here and there. I think the bold flavors of the smokiness from the meat and the barbecue sauce might have overwhelmed my taste buds, because I thought that the first few bites of biscuit were flavorful, but after a few bites of brisket, the gravy became bland, and it became more chore than leisure to finish it. Unfortunately, I only took two or three spoonfuls of mac and cheese, which I ordered from the Elbow Room menu. I had shared the Chicken Tinga Mac with someone, who ended up taking it home, but from the spoonfuls I did have, it was too dry for my liking. I like my mac to be a little saucier, and it just wasn't up to par. Luckily, you're on this page, because you want barbecue, and in that case, you're probably better off ordering barbecue than mac, and probably some of the other sides that they offer, like the potato salad, which adds a nice acidity to the meal, or the collards. That being said, I haven't tried the collards, so I can't vouch for them, but after eating SO MUCH MEAT, greens seem to be a good idea."
11146,3345,5,1,2/24/2014,"I've lived in the neighborhood for three years, and in that time, I've watched 4 different BBQ spots open up within walking distance of my apartment. You could say I'm spoiled. You could also say that I have high standards for my meat (as high as they can be this side of the Mason Dixon line, anyway). Anyway, Morgan's pretty much hits on all cylinders. Good beers on tap. Table service! Amazing whiskey/bourbon selection. Cool bartenders and waitresses. TVs. And of course, great BBQ. A breakdown of my meal: -pulled pork: definitely the best thing I had here -corn bread: surprisingly good and moist, the pepper jam is my jam! -pork ribs: fall of the bone tender, but it's by weight, so you may get 2 or 3 per lb -Texas red chili: difficult to eat without a spoon, but definitely a great side choice -Brisket: the only disappointment. We ordered the fatty (which cost more per pound), and it was pretty lean. It was also way overseasoned with the black pepper rub and was way too salty. BrisketTown and Fette Sau's is better, or if you're in the neighborhood, Little Brother. All in all, I'll definitely be making my way back to Morgan's (helps that it's three blocks from my apartment!)."
11147,3345,5,1,2/22/2014,"Barbecue realness!!! I go here every chance I get because the Mac and cheese is so addicting. The service is excellent! Go there on any given weeknight and you will likely find a boisterous, happy crowd of folks hanging out. Fatty brisket is excellent -- very flavorful! The pork ribs are also amazing. And their happy hour is something you cannot miss since you can eat like a king for $15. The seats are a bit uncomfortable though since there are no cushions..."
11148,3345,3,1,2/21/2014,"Good. Not great. Drinks- I had the bourbon and sweet tea cocktail which was standard, nothing special. Food- we ordered pork ribs, pulled pork, regular mac and cheese, and collard greens. Nothing really stood out. It was a solid meal, ˜average. Nothing to write home about. Service- friendly and efficient."
9247,3345,5,1,2/17/2014,"Can't express how much we love this place. Our friend ordered the breed rib, which lives up to its ginormous name. It's was truly delicious. I'm waiting to have Ava's thing here. The jerk mac and cheese was amazing as well. ˜I think I'm addicted."
11149,3345,4,1,2/14/2014,"It id's really good junk food that isn't greasy. ˜It is a better version of an old school diner, it serves the under 30 crowed what they want after a few hours at a bar."
11150,3345,5,1,2/14/2014,ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh so good. go now. the end.
11151,3345,5,1,2/9/2014,"Thoroughly excellent, with one caveat: I adore salt, I adore black pepper, and if you don't, much of the food will probably overwhelm your palate with its heavyhanded seasoning. Brisket and pulled pork were pleasantly fatty with moderate smokiness, greens were refreshingly simple and unadorned, red chili was earthy and rich, and the pinto beans were a saline departure from the sugary stuff most BBQ joints serve. Even the BBQ sauce, which isn't really needed, was a superb balance of fruit and vinegar. I took a 25-minute train ride from the UWS to get here, and will do so again."
11152,3345,3,1,2/9/2014,BBQ was mediocre. The first time we went it was really tasty. The second time seems like it was off.
9768,3345,4,1,2/8/2014,"Two of my friends raved about this place this past summer. They got take out and parked themselves at my house and I was impressed. I finally made it to the actual restaurant with them one super late Saturday night. I was tired but perked up a bit when I smelled all the BBQ that greeted me from the door. I didn't want anything to heavy b/c I felt if I even had a bite of a rib I would be laid out on the table from ˜a food coma. I ordered the baked sweet potato w/ roasted turkey on top and I didn't think it would be at good as it was. My lovely friends ordered darn near everything on the menu to share and I think they only left scraps. We were able to speak with the owner who was definitely a cool personable guy who you could tell really wanted to make sure his customers were having a great ˜food experience. He was even kind enough to offer us dessert ˜to share on him. I think he really wanted me to pass out which i almost did when I tasted that ˜new apple crumble cobbler and brownie...SOOOOO GOOD! However, if you know me i always looking for bread pudding...which was told is seasonal :(. I'll definitely be coming back and hoping bread pudding is in season!"
11153,3345,4,1,2/8/2014,"I wanted to give 3.5 stars, but had to round and decided to round up. I went with a group of five for my birthday and we shared the beef brisket, pork ribs, and the special which was a pork belly and sauerkraut creation, with sides of mac and cheese, collard greens, potato salad, and cornbread. The moist brisket was both moist and tender, though not very fatty. The rub was a bit too strong for me and took away from the amazing flavor and texture of the meat. Just a touch lighter on the pepper and it would be absolute perfection. The pork ribs used the exact same rub to the same effect. They were perfectly moist and the meat was great if you scraped off the rub. The BBQ sauce was delicious, though I never use much because my favorite part of BBQ is the meat. The mac and cheese wasn't bad, it just wasn't good. It needs... something. The collard greens were great, perfect flavor. The potato salad was nothing to write home about but it went well with the BBQ which is its job so I would definitely order it again. The cornbread is delicious, especially with the butter. And we ended our meal with the maple bourbon pecan pie and ice cream, which really stole the show. The atmosphere is nice and not too crowded. The staff are all very friendly and helpful, and the service is amazing. The food came out quickly and everyone enjoyed their drinks. I grew up in Texas and miss easy access to incredible BBQ and have started my search for the best I can get in New York. This was tasty, but just not close enough to become my go to BBQ joint in Brooklyn."
11154,3345,5,1,2/6/2014,"The title of my review should be called: A Tale of Two Briskets. One of the staple items I've come to enjoy at Morgan's Barbecue is their highly-regarded moist brisket, often paired with corn bread and mac n cheese. But the past two times I've ordered brisket, I've noticed the moist brisket being...well...not quite as fatty. When I order a fatty brisket, I want that nice thick layer which protected our bovine champion from the elements...and I'd like that with a side of corn bread and mac n cheese, please. With my soliloquy out of the way, I must say that the not-as-moist brisket is actually MORE flavorful than before, so I am sated for the time being. To date, it remains the best darn brisket I've ever had. In addition to their main attraction, their pork ribs possess the right combination of smokiness and texture that allows for extremely tender meat, yet still gives you the pleasure of biting into it (fall off the bone is overrated). Same goes for the underrated beef ribs which come brontosaurus-sized and carries a nice char without drying out the meat which remained tender and fatty. My suggestion would be to cut the rib meat off the bone, so that you can eat it in small bites. I'll admit that I rarely go outside my comfort zone with the side dishes, so all that can be said about the mac n cheese is that it's delicious. Overall, if you've eaten at Dinosaur BBQ and Hill Country, you owe it to yourself to try Morgan's BBQ and inevitably pronounce it as the best barbecue in NYC. Do it...do it."
9905,3345,4,1,2/2/2014,"went with friends and, as a group, shared the pork ribs, brisket, turkey, mac & cheese, and collard greens, plus the pecan pie and peach blueberry cobbler for dessert. ˜everything was very good but there was no consensus among the four of us of which was our favorite -- one of my friends liked the ribs best, two of my friends liked the brisket best, and i actually liked the turkey best -- which was shocking even to me. ˜(not that i don't like turkey but i love pork and i love beef, and i thought the turkey was going to be a throwaway entree, but it was actually seasoned wonderfully and really moist -- so, as shocked as i was, it was my favorite of the three entrees. ˜everything was delicious, though i tend to prefer a saucier rib, personally.) ˜mac & cheese was meh, collard greens were fine. ˜pecan pie was very good, cobbler was ok. ˜also, our waitress was great -- personable and friendly, attentive and efficient, and yet never making us feel like we were being rushed out the door despite how many people were waiting for a table. my only complaint is that, as a non-beer-drinker, i wish there were more options on drinks. ˜their bar actually looked like it had been halfheartedly stocked, but that might have changed since i was there, it could've been a temporary thing. all in all, definitely tasty, and definitely go with a few people so you can try multiple things."
11155,3345,4,1,2/2/2014,"Happened upon Morgans because the restaurant I wanted to go to had a 30 minute wait. As soon as you step in through the tall wood doors, the aroma hits you! ˜The BBQ! ˜ I ordered half a pound of pork ribs (which turned out to be about 3 bones), the collard greens, fully loaded potato and Mac and cheese. The ribs are delicious. They're plain, but there's a bottle of their signature BBQ sauce on each table. The collards were also amazing as was the baked potato. The Mac and cheese left much to be desired, though. There's a full bar in the front, but the drink menu they gave us was very limited. I asked for 2 things and was told they had neither so I just stuck with water. There appears to be outdoor seating for the warmer months and this excites me! ˜I can't wait to come back with my daughter. She's going to love it."
11156,3345,4,1,1/29/2014,"Let's talk service. We walked in on a cold Saturday evening with the kids. They were constructing a vestibule to keep out the cold. Smart. We were seated by the kitchen so it was warm and lively. Our waitress was sassy and cute, which fits the vibe. Food was easy to order and the menu was clear and unlike other BBQ joints, we didn't feel like we over-ordered, so it was affordable. The manager asked if this was our first time--it was. He sent out the Frito Pie, which is just what you'd think. Chili and Fritos served in a Frito's wrapper. Kids loved it. Service was fast. Food was yummy. Sassy and cute waitress spilled a mason jar of ice cold water on my wife's lap and they picked up the check. Happy to recommend Morgan's to my friends. Everyone makes mistakes and they did us right. Wishing them lots of success."
11157,3345,5,1,1/28/2014,The BEST brisket in NYC. ˜I've had Franklin and I've had Morgans. ˜Now I can gladly die of cardiac arrest. Only negative is the Texas Longhorns flag. ˜BOOO
11158,3345,4,1,1/26/2014,"Loved the gigantic beef rib. It was a juicy tender short rib that I didn't want to share. The rub used is a touch spicy but so good with the fat from the rib. I know everyone loves the moist brisket here, and man it was mighty flavorful but I was very surprised that the brisket wasn't really fatty. Maybe I'm just used to hillcountry's overly fatty brisket. ˜ The cornbread with peppers and honey butter is a must have. Mac and cheese, as well as the beans were ok, but clearly not the star of dinner (for me at least). I came on a Sat night, and found the service to be incredibly friendly but the hostess hard to find. Then I realized she was doubling as waitservice. For a place this busy, they should have a dedicated hostess. Overall, a fantastic very affordable and delicious bbq. Sorry hillcountry, I think I have a new bbq love."
11159,3345,4,1,1/25/2014,"Great BBQ! ˜ My friend and I went for a girls night and tried to eat as much possible between the two of us. For meat, we went with the fatty brisket, pulled pork and the sausage. ˜ All metas were moist, good temp and great flavor. ˜We couldn't get enough. ˜ Sides - collard greens, coleslaw, cornbread and Mac & cheese. ˜Another round of tasty southern sides. ˜Dessert was fair with the apple pie. Staff was friendly and knowledgable."
11160,3345,4,1,1/25/2014,"Me and my friend were going to another restaurant when we walked in front of this barbecue and decided to try... NO BETTER CHOICE!! The location is very warm, nice lights, and I love the industrial style furniture! The service was ok, a little bit on the sly in my opinion, it could have been better. Let's talk about the meal. Potatoes salad, was very good, well seasoned, a tiny overpriced, but was very good. Corn in the cup. Delicious!! And do what my friend did, squeeze the lime on, gives that bitter taste that creates an harmony with the other ingredients! Then the amazing pork ribs! Wow, they were so tender that we could have eaten them without teeth. So succulent and juicy we didn't add any gravy on. We took 2 lbs and we couldn't finish them. Even the bill was ok, the total was around 48, that my friend kindly paid for. I would def suggest this place, for the location, for the quality, for the prices, and even because it's in a nice area. They could work a little bit more on the service, and next time I will give 5 stars."
11161,3345,4,1,1/24/2014,Arrived on a busy Friday evening with patience and was greeted with friendliness ˜and free chips & cheese. The pulled meats were tasty as were the sides. I'd probably go back. And if it were not so cold outside I'd go to the elbow room window!
11162,3345,4,1,1/24/2014,The other good reviews are true. The service is great and the meat melts in your mouth. What's odd is how dainty the food is. Don't believe the roll of brown paper towels on the table; you can go here on a first date.
11163,3345,4,1,1/23/2014,"This place is fun... mainly because our server was great. ˜Also helps that the food's pretty darn good. ˜ Cinnamon battered Texas toast is a must get. ˜I got the brisket taco for my main. ˜Pretty good and the BBQ sauce is even better. ˜Cheese grits? ˜Yum! ˜Friends got the fatty brisket. ˜Take a bite, close your eyes. ˜Melt-in-you-mouth-buttery goodness. ˜Gah that was good. No coffee or unsweetened tea but that's OK. ˜If you like sweet, definitely get their sweet tea."
11164,3345,5,1,1/22/2014,"Was walking to a different restaurant when I saw Morgan's and decided to take a friends advice. Forget that other restaurant- Morgan's is where its at! The most important part of any barbecue restaurant is the barbecue of course. Morgan's did not disappoint. The ribs were made with an excellent dry rub, no sauce needed. The meat was so tender my friend and I joked you could eat it with no teeth. You wrap your mouth around the bone and the mean falls off. TREMENDOUS. The sides were a little pricy, generally $6 for small and $12 for large. We had the potato salad which I enjoyed but the side not to be missed is the creamed corn. Squeeze that lime and enjoy! There is also a macaroni and cheese restaurant next door you can order from. We didn't partake but they certainly had some alluring choices. Above all else go for the barbecue. I highly recommend and will return."
11165,3345,5,1,1/17/2014,"Went there once and they did everything right. Good lighting, comfortable bar, good design. Music was a little cliche but not a big deal. Friendly, relaxed sincere service that didn't feel forced. This is a big thing for me. Service at other bbq joints i find to always be weird- either overly jolly, bitter, or unprofessional. Food comes out FAST. What's up with waiting forever for your food at other bbq places? I don't subscribe to that trend. The foods already been cooked. What the ef? Priced less than other bbq places. Except for some key sides which were overpriced at $6 FOR A SMALL. The pork ribs were well seasoned , nice fat to meat ratio, very tender. Meaty. Kinda perfect. Collards were good to me. Tender, balanced. No slime . I like it."
11166,3345,2,1,1/17/2014,"I have by about three times. Each time, I was told by my mediocre staff that they don't have any ribs! What? A BBQ place with no ribs. It was too early in the evening to run out. Then, no more cornbread? What? How do you run out of cornbread so early in the evening. This happened on each visit. The fatty brisket was good. The potato salad was $6 which included a small cup of one heaping tablespoon. The Mac n cheese was bland. We ordered a sweet potatoe, which was $4 and received a half of potato. I asked where the other half was, and the waitress called over a female manager. She was nervously trying to be chatty and friendly but said that was the norm. So, look to spend $8 for a whole potato. By the way, we decided to go to Elbow Room the next day to try the Mac n cheese. The girl at the window acted as we were disturbing her conversation. She was unfriendly and mumbled every time we asked a question. We sat down to eat sitting with other guests who all admitted that the worst part of elbow room is the poor service window. Why can't they train and hire good help and pay a decent salary. I will never order from elbow room again and I tell everyone to stay away. I am giving Morgans the benefit of the doubt by giving it 2 stars hoping they will improve over time. Our blande and disappointing dinner cost $70 without drinks. Keep away."
11167,3345,5,1,1/16/2014,"As a native Texan, I'm picky about my BBQ, and was skeptical when I heard a Texas BBQ joint was opening in the neighborhood. Needless to say, I had to go the week it opened. Since then, I have eaten at Morgan's almost once a week. Willie Nelson ought to write a song about it, it's that good. The meats are cooked to perfection, the sauce is just right - not too sweet or too vinegary like in some other (inferior) states, and the service is quick and friendly. I would be willing to wager it's the only place north of the Mason Dixon that serves both Frito Pie and Shiner Bock on draft, two Texas favorites. The sides are all good, from green bean casserole to the stuffed baked potato, and the desserts are simple, but done right (don't miss the bourbon pecan pie). My only request is that they serve more pickles, especially with the pulled pork (they're available if you ask). Overall, this is a terrific addition to the Brooklyn restaurant scene - a legit slice of the Lone Star State."
11168,3345,4,1,1/15/2014,"Alrighty, so the first time I ate here, ˜it was halfway through a night of drinking, and I swore these were the most delicious brisket soft tacos I had ever eaten in my entire life on earth. But! I know my intoxicated taste buds tend to lie to me, so I went back another time (sober!) to test these tacos again! And then I went back again a few days ago.. and I think I want to go back sometime this weekend.. because these tacos are BOMB. Since the tacos have really cast a spell on me, I can't really say anything about the other stuff on the menu, haha. Oh, but I will say that the FRITO PIE... is a must try. ;P It is genius. My boyfriend and I split one, and I severely regretted not getting my own. We even looked up the recipe so we can make some of that goodness at home! Besides the food, service is usually on point! Pleasant waiters/waittresses and food is prepared promptly! This place is also conveniently located near the Barclays center, so it makes for a good post-game/post-concert pit stop."
11169,3345,3,1,1/14/2014,"Because my last experience was pleasant I decided to indulge again.... Well I was pretty disappointed 1) The place was Freezing?!? Hello it's winter, where the hell is the heat?!? ˜We find out via the middle of our meal, that the heating system was broken. WHAT?!? There are places called Home Depot, Loews and Pintchik (which is across the street) that you can buy heaters.... 2) My family loves cornbread and theirs is pretty good, when we ordered our second batch they ran out?!? ˜A BBQ restaurant w/ no cornbread? Who does that?! ˜ 3) what restaurant in NYC during the winter does not serve hot beverages? I asked for a hot tea...no hot water available? Huh? I'm confused and annoyed! Our server Alex was a gem!!! We would have left in the muddle of our meal if it wasn't for Alex.... The owner/management has much to be desired in relation to customer service. If u decide to go make sure the heat is working and that they are fully stocked. Good luck!!"
11170,3345,5,1,1/14/2014,"Right before I saw Beyonce' perform at the Barclays center, I ate BBQ. Which was probably a bad idea because all I wanted to do after eating @MorgansBK was throw on my favorite jammies & go to sleep, however my bff (in my head) @Beyonce was waiting for me so.. anyway I digress. This is what I like to call ""Have a Seat BBQ."" Don't make any additional plans to do anything strenuous, simply ""Have a Seat"". Mac & Cheese.. have a seat. Potato Salad... have a seat. Brisket.. have a seat. Dry rubbed then smoked Beef Ribs... have several seats! Morgans is killing it as far as authentic BBQ in New York. Oh & shout out to co-owner Joel Bolden for sending out that Frito Pie.. my heart skipped a beat, in a good way. ""Maria's Don't Miss"" The Smoked Beef Ribs ˜-Maria Taylor ""What's New In New York"""
11171,3345,4,1,1/13/2014,Went there before the Jay-Z concert last night. Loved it. I had the brisket sandwich and I got collerd greens and sweet tea. The service was awesome as well
11172,3345,5,1,1/13/2014,Pork ribs and fatty brisket were the stars. The smoky queso appetizer was also fantastic. The waitstaff was very friendly/prompt and seemed very knowledgeable re food & drinks.
11173,3345,4,1,1/11/2014,"Loved it! Juicy brisket and yummy mac 'n cheese. Great atmosphere and lay out, and very friendly staff. Nice whiskey and bourbon choices if you're into that. Hope to visit often."
11174,3345,4,1,1/10/2014,"I wish I lived above this place, I would eat here every day. I can't even describe how good their fatty brisket is, just go eat it. The mac and cheese is good but I wish they had all the options of Elbow Room (which is attached?). In short, everything I've had here has been amazing but they do run out of stuff so be prepared."
11175,3345,4,1,1/6/2014,"Came in on a Saturday recently with some friends and ordered a mix of meats and sides to try. The pork ribs and fatty brisket are both really good, very peppery and fall-apart succulent. The pulled pork was alright, but definitely not as good as the pork rib or brisket. The sauce they serve is pretty good too, not too sweet. Didn't need any on the brisket or ribs, but it went well with the pork. The sides I tried (collards, slaw, and corn cup) were tasty, but overpriced. Decent selection of beers and whiskeys as well. Overall I was pretty pleased with the place, and am happy to have a new BBQ place in the area."
11176,3345,4,1,1/2/2014,"I really like Morgan's and am so glad they came to the neighborhood. Lean brisket and pulled pork are delicious. Get the sweet potato. Hell, ask if they can stuff the sweet potato with brisket. It's worth it. Collard greens were just OK. Mac and cheese apparently not the best. Beans really good. Brisket tacos are awesome. Love the sauce! Nice selection of sides to divvy up so you can try a lot."
11177,3345,4,1,1/1/2014,"Great food. Pulled pork sandwich had tender and tasty meat with a great bun that was soft but strong enough to hold the rest. Brisket (fatty) was tasty and had great texture. The potato salad was solid. Slaw was also solid. The sauce had a ton of garlic but was quite good. Interesting for ""Texas"" BBQ. Server was sweet. On the down side, the music was obnoxiously loud."
11178,3345,5,1,12/22/2013,Closest BBQ to Texas I've had outside of Texas! And... those beans are the real deal. Like straight out of the RGV. Brought me back to a long lost home.
11179,3345,4,1,12/15/2013,"Excellent breakfast burrito, and good service. ˜If the loaded potato had been same quality (it was a kinda small and not hot enough to melt the cheese on it) then there'd be 5 stars here."
11180,3345,5,1,12/12/2013,"High competition in the Brooklyn BBQ scene, but personally I think Morgan's is top of the class...Had an assortment of food: fatty brisket, lean brisket, pulled pork, cornbread, baked sweet potato and ribs, and they were all incredibly delicious. This place has burnt ends down to a science. Great beer selection too, plenty of good pairings to go with all that meat. Will be back for seconds."
11181,3345,2,1,12/10/2013,"The staff here are really, really nice and probably the best part, but the 'cue didn't do it for me tonight. ""Fatty"" brisket was lean, dry, and not fresh. You go to Hill Country or Mighty Quinns to get brisket and it tastes like the meat just came off the smoker. Unfortunately Morgan's doesn't come close to achieving that. Beef sausage tasted pretty good, but it was cut up into small pieces and all the juice and fat had run out before I took my first bite. It was like eating sawdust. This is easy to fix: give the grown ups a knife and let them cut it up. The best food was the sides, slaw was really nice, pinto beans were awesome. I knew eating here wasn't going to be the second coming of Christ, but I expected more than what I got."
11182,3345,5,1,12/7/2013,"I can't get enough of that pulled pork sammich. Also, Mariel and Feleahcia are the coolest. Definitely check this place out. I'm not biased at all."
11183,3345,4,1,12/7/2013,Delicious BBQ. Friendly fun environment. I've been a handful of times since they opened and really enjoy the spot. The staff is friendly and engaging and Fatty/Lean Brisket and Ribs are awesome! Reasonable for prices too.
11184,3345,5,1,12/4/2013,"This is a great option to grab a bite before an event at the Barclays center. It's just a couple blocks away, right down the street. Loved this place. Love the decor, the way it's laid out, the service, the food, the drinks, etc. I did the Mac, Cornbread, Pulled Pork Tacos and I loved them all. If you're going to a Nets game, and you stop in here, this place will be the highlight of your night!!!"
11185,3345,5,1,12/3/2013,"This is a tasty, tasty BBQ place. We were a group of 6, easily seated in the HUGE space that they have, and proceed to eat as much of that grub as possible. Frito pie, pulled pork, cornbread with pepper jelly, ribs falling off the bone, FATTY BRISKET. The meats really stand out, but everything was super awesome. And, to top it all off, we had a really fun time with our waitress. Psyched that this place has moved into the neighb. See ya soon, Morgan's!"
11186,3345,4,1,12/3/2013,i was quite surprised the the BBQ was GREAT! you wont be disappointed there. the staff is very welcoming and they make the experience fun. I will be going back here.
11187,3345,3,1,12/3/2013,"I give the food here 4 stars. However, prices are a little high. When I order a $14 sandwich I expect a nice size portion, not a small burger bun with a few slices of sausage and some pulled pork. It was tasty but over priced IMO. Service was very good. Morgans is definitely worth a visit but be prepared for the bill..."
11188,3345,5,1,12/2/2013,I love this place! ˜Awesome BBQ - my favorite is the BBQ brisket stuffed potato and the mac n cheese. ˜Service is amazing. ˜If you like bourbon - they have an insane amount to choose from. ˜Prices are fantastic too!
11189,3345,2,1,12/1/2013,"As loathe as I am to give poor & mediocre reviews when I can't really fault the experience... I'm convinced I would rate Morgan's higher if it was the first Texas-style BBQ I'd had. Alas, I've only been to a few such places in NYC, but the food was significantly better elsewhere. Especially given what we paid (about $80 for two). The brisket we ordered came out kind of... cold. We told the waitress and she had it warmed up. The pulled pork was a bit cold too, but at that point we couldn't be bothered and just ate it. They had some kind of pinto beans side, no southern-style baked beans in sight, which were kind of bland. I liked the collard greens and the cornbread with pepper jelly. But the food overall wasn't up to par. It's amazing how much better Mighty Quinn's in the East Village is, given that it's much cheaper."
11190,3345,3,1,11/30/2013,"I went here with my family on a Sunday night, and it was busy. We sat inside, so it was loud. The tables are close together, so there's not much room in the back. The service is good, and the servers make good recommendations. For example, they were honest about serving size because you order by the quarter pound. The fatty brisket and the ribs are the best bbq items. The pulled pork was dry. None of the sides were special. If you are in Park Slope, this is a decent bbq restaurant but manage your expectations."
11191,3345,4,1,11/24/2013,"I went here by chance one night, and overall it was pretty good. ˜Is it really Texas BBQ in NYC? ˜Not quite. ˜But it was pretty good. ˜The service was very friendly. ˜I have to say that while it wasn't quite Texas BBQ, I had the lean beef brisket and it was the most tender brisket I've ever had...I used the knife maybe twice."
11192,3345,2,1,11/22/2013,"Finding amazing BBQ is difficult in NYC. ˜I still prefer Hill Country and Fette Sau but these are not the closest destinations when you live in the Slope. ˜I finally got around to checking out Morgan's BBQ this week. ˜I got the fatty brisket. ˜It was pretty good. ˜Some bits were too salty though which was disappointing. ˜I got a huge fat hunk with virtually no meat which was also disappointing. ˜At these prices, you don't want a slice that is mostly fat. ˜I had the mac 'n cheese and collard greens. ˜They don't sell green beans anymore or so they say. ˜That was disappointing as well. ˜The mac 'n cheese was ok. ˜It needed more of a cheesy flavor. ˜The collard greens were more disappointing. ˜They tasted like warm spicy shredded pickles. ˜I've never had collard greens like that. ˜It was like someone cooked it with pure vinegar and jalapenos. ˜The corn bread was fine. ˜The jam was ok. ˜I've had better. ˜Personally, I don't think corn bread and white bread should be fancy. ˜3 bucks for a small hunk is a little ridiculous. ˜The space itself is on par for the area. ˜The service is fast and friendly so kudos for that. ˜Since it's the closest BBQ in my area, I'll probably break down and go there when I'm in the mood for some BBQ. ˜And I definitely like the idea of it being open late with a limited menu but it's not on my short list of places to go now that it's off my list of to-do's."
9842,3345,4,1,11/22/2013,"I.LOVE.THIS.PLACE. Been here twice in four days and have to say it makes me miss TX. ˜Fatty brisket is perfect, chopped beef is amazing, and the pork links are fracking awesome. Staff is very attentive and friendly. ˜Damn, feeling homesick.... Place would have 5 stars if it had a Baylor University flag hanging. ˜Sic' EM Bears!"
11193,3345,5,1,11/19/2013,"Finally, real Texas BBQ in New York! We had the pork ribs (amazing), fatty brisket (tender and flavorful), and sides of mac and cheese (ever been to the Elbow Room? Same kitchen, so @#$%ing good!) and cole slaw (addicting). Our server, Ashley, was so sweet and cute (and from Texas to boot! Do they import all their servers along with their pitmaster?) and took great care of us, you should hope she's there when you visit! All in all, 5/5 on food, decor, service, and will be there again soon... go now before the word gets out and it gets too crowded!"
11194,3345,2,1,11/17/2013,"So disappointing. Cute decor, has potential. Our waitress was horrid. Like couldn't even fill our water without being waived down. We were her only table. She also spent lots of time playing with her hair, I mean all up in it. Gross you handle food. She was not inviting or attentive at all. Food. It was decent, nothing memorable. And expensive! $30 for two BBQ sandwhiches and Mac and cheese and we just drank water. Wth. Not to mention the menu says sandwiches come with a side for lunch, apparently that is only mon-fri. Misleading, the menu doesn't mention that at all. Will not return or recommend."
11195,3345,5,1,11/15/2013,"Four and a half very high. Pretty certain this is currently the BEST BBQ you can find in NYC. ˜Stopped in once a few weeks after it first opened in September and was disappointed to find they were awaiting their liquor license and were not permitted to ˜allow BYOB either. ˜We toughed it out nonetheless, and I was impressed by the food. ˜Went back again last weekend when the full bar was in full swing during a Texas college football game, ˜and was considerably more impressed. ˜Everything was excellent all around when it came to the meats. ˜Of particular note was the succulent and moist turkey, a rarity in NYC BBQ spots to say the least, the fine pork ribs and pulled pork, usually reliably the most underwhelming option at a BBQ place for me, in this case quite good and not dried out. ˜The star of the show however for me was without a doubt the brisket, particularly the fatty, which was astonishingly good. ˜Its infused with a wondrous deep smokiness, and melts in your mouth. ˜It is better than Brisket-town's version, my former NYC brisket benchmark, by a considerable margin. ˜ As I mentioned the scene was quite boisterous to say the least, in large part due to the college game but enhanced even more so by the high energy staff whose antics verged on theatrics, in an entertaining way. ˜ ˜The food was so good that the friend I dined with and I returned during the week for lunch and got the brisket and pulled pork tacos, served in the traditional Austin style on soft flour tortillas with Tex-Mex fixings. ˜They were uniformly excellent as well. ˜The scene was decidedly mellower this time and we were lucky enough to meet the pit master who proved to be a great guy who along with another Texan staffer gave me some valuable advice on which establishments I cannot miss, and which I should skip on my upcoming trip down to Austin. ˜The place is fantastic and judging from my twice in a week visits here this week, quite dangerous for me to have this close to my apartment."
11196,3345,3,1,11/14/2013,"Good service. Decent BBQ for NYC. Far too salty. As a southerner from Memphis and the Texas hill country it didn't fill me full of rage. Would get 4 stars if the beer wasn't served in Mason jars, which is stupid and kitschy. Best sauce I've had in NYC. Best meat tried was the pulled pork. EXCELLENT spicy collards."
11197,3345,5,1,11/12/2013,"Holy cow, batman! Everything is delicious, especially the green bean casserole (I know, I'm pretty shocked that my favorite item at a BBQ place isn't even BBQ). The beer options are limited, but good. The bartenders are nothing short of ""the best bartenders ever."" Seriously. I'm thrilled this place exists."
11198,3345,4,1,11/10/2013,"Went for brunch and we had breakfast burrito, collard greens, fatty brisket, Mac and cheese and pancakes. Everything was delicious, and service was good. ˜I will definitely be back."
11199,3345,5,1,11/9/2013,"I decided to write this review after eating at a different barbecue restaurant, need not mention their name. ˜The brisket at Morgan's is smoky and peppery, juicy and moist....oh man, and the bark.... ˜I'm so full but my mouth is watering just thinking about. ˜There really isn't another place quite like it, the waitstaff is friendly and helpful, the bartenders are cute and clever, and Pitmaster is serious about his barbecue. ˜I still haven't even mentioned the ribs... The meat falls right off the bone, I could have eaten an entire rack. ˜I'm starting to sound like a carnivore. ˜I'll save the vegetables for my next visit/review."
11200,3345,5,1,11/9/2013,"I live in Brooklyn not Austin. I don't have any opinion as to how ""BBQ should be served"" based on another state's recipe and food culture. So simply put the BBQ is tasty. Not smothered in sauce. ˜Great cuts, affordable especially compared to the chain-like BBQ experience at Hill Country. Energetic restaurant. Nice interior. Great union of indoor and outdoor space. They were out of a few things. ˜Not offensive to me; if it's fresh and popular it sells out. I get it. Highly recommended."
11201,3345,3,1,11/9/2013,"Morgan's - another trendy Brooklyn barbecue spot made famous by a sixth degree of separation from a genuine barbecue establishment 1,800 miles away. It's a long way from Austin for pitmaster John Avila, where at some point between the humid hills of central Texas and the tree-lined streets of Brooklyn, something got lost. Not something, many things. First, the meat is excellent, but to get the equivalent of a $20 Texas-sized portion, you'll be spending $60 Brooklyn dollars - an immediate turnoff. Second, and most disappointing, is that they don't have pickles. I'm by no means a pickle aficionado, and I'm as repulsed by Brooklyn's fixation with pickling everything as any reasonable man is, but I need pickles with my barbecue. Period. Finally, white bread -- the fluffy loaves that engulf your food trays in Austin -- is nowhere to be found (unless requested, and only in small portions). A distinctly Brooklyn move that really shows where Morgan's priorities are. White bread is the cheapest, easiest way to keep people coming back. And Morgan's buries it. I almost might consider myself unreasonable were it not for Hill Country Barbecue in Manhattan - New York's friendliest, most generous, most exciting barbecue destination that, like Woody Harrelson and Keifer Sutherland in ""The Cowboy Way"", never seemed to have lost its identity in spite of all the reasons it should have."
11202,3345,1,1,11/4/2013,"This place is not ready for prime time. Executive Summary: 1. Menu is cryptic (apparently sides are only ""free"" with sandwiches M-F, but not the weekends. Was that clear to us when we ordered? No. Did they server Explain? Nope.) 2. Kitchen is disorganized and runs out of things that BBQ joints should NEVER EVER run out of. Like ribs. And chili. 3. The help is inexperienced, nervous, and poorly trained. (We ordered three things that weren't on the menu, and so our waitress sent other people over to explain this inexplicable fact to us, because we'd already been let down multiple times in a row.) I would love to write a review of the major highs and lows of the menu, but I can't, because so much of it was unavailable on the day I was there. What I did have: pulled pork sandwich (good to very good meat, coleslaw too coarsely chopped.) Collards (good to very good.) Red chili (ditto.) Our experience there was so disappointing that, after staying through the end of the lunch service so we could order the expanded dinner menu, and THEN being told that they were OUT of many of the prime dinner items, we cancelled the rest of our order and just fled. They removed the ""extra"" charge for weekend sides willingly because we'd already been disappointed so many times in a single visit, but I see from the other reviews here that many other folks are confused by this, shall we say, finer point of the menu."
11203,3345,2,1,11/4/2013,"I give Morgan's two stars in hopes that in a month or two I can go back and then add a few more stars. I went for brunch with three friends and they came to sit us as we were still perusing the menu and deciding whether or not we wanted to eat there. We decided to go for it, but upon sitting down we were promptly told that the regular brunch menu was not an option. Instead they gave one piece of paper with all new brunch items. Unfortunately, some of the stuff that was on the original brunch menu was what we had wanted, but we figured we'd make do. The waitress (who was a bit weird) came to take our drink orders. I had seen a bloody mary go by and asked how much they were since they weren't listed on the menu. She said she didn't know but that she ""thought"" they were $9. The one I'd seen was tiny, so there was no way I was going to get it. My friend ordered coffee, but was promptly told they didn't have coffee. Who serves brunch and doesn't have coffee?? We ordered food and it came pretty quickly. Nothing was hot though, which was unfortunate because the flavors were there it was just too cold. I got the biscuits and gravy with the mushroom gravy. Really yummy gravy, but the biscuits were too dense. I grew up in the south and know what biscuits should taste like, and these were not that. I also split a side of mac and cheese with a friend. It was fine, but nothing special, and again it was almost cold which is not good for mac and cheese. My other friends liked their food... one got a breakfast burrito and said the brisket was delicious. Another got a large plate of banana pancakes, which were good (although there was nutella on the top, which I don't think he was expecting). The third got a sandwich and had to order a side of mac and cheese bc they only serve sides with their sandwiches M-F for lunch. Luckily she asked the waitress about this before she ordered so she wasn't surprised by the bill when it arrived, like some other people have been. The menu really needs to be updated to say M-F though. Then as we were paying the bill, the friend who got the burrito had been charged an extra $2 for it. Overall a pretty mediocre meal, a bit too expensive, and WHO DOESN'T HAVE COFFEE? I would go back in a month or two if they are still around in the hopes that they will have figured out some of these issues. Oh, and the upstairs bathroom door knocks into the door to the kitchen, so I came VERY close to colliding with a waiter when I came out of it. Not a good design."
11204,3345,5,1,11/3/2013,"Seriously awesome. Both dinner and brunch are awesome. My fave for dinner is the green bean casserole and cobbler. For brunch: biscuits and gravy. Enough said... But I'll say more. There was ample gravy atop the perfect biscuit. The banana pancakes were huge and perfectly delicious. One of the best brunches we've ever indulged in. As for the comments about the limited brunch menu: yes, there are things on the menu that they don't have yet. They just started serving brunch, so they're not fully ready yet... No big deal. We'll just have to go back. One downside: they stopped playing country music. Boo to that."
11205,3345,2,1,11/3/2013,"I love BBQ and there are some great places to find it in NYC. This is not one of them. I can't believe what I'm seeing from some of these other reviews. Every last bit of meat we ate was improperly cooked. The name of the game here was acceptable/edible, but absolutely 100% not worth the price. At usual New York prices $20/lb for lean brisket and $22/lb for fatty brisket, it better be some of the best damn brisket this side of the mason dixon line. That's the status quo in NYC. Unfortunately, Mighty Quinn's and Mable's both have superior brisket for the same price. (and honestly, I'm not even a huge fan of Mable's brisket, but we'll get to that) This brisket, while beautifully smoked, was cooked to death. Again, it was totally edible, but it was absolutely overcooked. This would have been much easier to overlook if we were talking about $18/lb brisket. But considering it was $20 on the low end, it was really disappointing how dry it was. (we got a half pound each of lean & fatty) ˜This may have had something to do with the array of heatlamps they employ, but either way, it was absolutely not worth the price. If you want amazing melt in your mouth brisket, go to Mighty Quinn's. The Pork Ribs were well seasoned; I like a bit of heat. But, these were also cooked improperly. I'd guess they were cooked at too high a temp for the collagen to break down allowing the meat to fall off the bone while simultaneously overcooking the meat. This is where Mable's shines. Every single time I've visited Mable's the pork ribs just fall off the bone, literally. You can pick up a bone and the meat will be left on the tray. This is not the case at Morgan's. I wasn't fighting with the bone, per se, but it was unpleasantly tough and not the delightful lip smacking tenderness you expect from properly cooked pork ribs. If you want amazing pork ribs, go to Mable's. Where I do think Morgan's shines is in their pulled pork tacos. These were wonderfully assembled and the pulled pork was tender and juicy as can be. These were fantastic and reasonably priced. Their sides are also reasonably priced and the quality here is high. The Mac & Cheese was delightful, with bread crumbs & topped with parmesan. The collards were fantastic. Really tender, well seasoned, not overcooked. Really nice. And boy-o, that cornbread. The cornbread stole the show, I think. It's easy to fall into a chewy dry mess of cornbread, but this cornbread was light, fluffy, sweet, moist, and tender, yet the outsides were firm. Fantastic cornbread. The two stars awarded are for the sides & for the service. Everyone was friendly as could be, even though it was packed. Lots of attention, great bartenders and reasonably priced drinks. All in all, if you're looking for a place to grab a quick bite and drink, Morgan's is fine. Just don't expect to get high quality BBQ."
11206,3345,5,1,11/1/2013,"Not really a fan of barbeque, so was not really expecting much. ˜The food is so delicious! ˜I got the pulled pork- it was so tender and smoky, but the taste wasn't overwhelming. ˜The roasted corn is like no other I have ever tasted. ˜Service was great and the food came out fast. ˜Prices are really fair too. ˜I went for dinner, but will definitely have to check out the brunch. One last note, I noticed a lot of people complaining about their running out of dishes. ˜As someone who takes their food seriously, I know it can be so disheartening to hear what you wanted was gone, especially since when I go somewhere I'm usually craving it like I'm 3 months pregnant. ˜That said, it seems to me the place has only been open for 2 months? ˜Perhaps you amateur food/restaurant critics don't know how hard it is to project what food you will need if you are brand new since you can't possibly forecast what business will be like. ˜Couple that with the high cost you need to recoup from opening and the goal to not let food go to waste (I think we can all agree with that one), sometimes restaurants run out early (and have way too much) before they find their groove. ˜It's not an excuse, I know, but perhaps you should cut them some slack. ˜Or maybe open your own restaurant and try to get it right; I doubt you could."
11207,3345,4,1,10/29/2013,"Went here last week for brisket and collards. 5 stars for brisket, 5 stars for service, 2 stars for greens. It seems silly to have another BBQ place within walking distance of Dinosaur, but if you don't feel like waiting for two hours, this is a good option!"
11208,3345,5,1,10/29/2013,"I professed my love for a well-known hipster BBQ place in Williamsburg awhile ago, but now that I've eaten at Morgan's, I feel like my loyalties have been divided. My partner, who rarely disagrees with me about food, still doesn't believe that Morgan's is better than the other, but overall I think we'll be seeing more of this place in the future. Given the quick seating, the great service at the bar, and the friendly low-key atmosphere, Morgan's seems a lot easier to dine at. We ordered portions of the pulled pork, fatty brisket, sausage, and ribs -- though they were all outstanding, my favourite by far was the fatty brisket, which melts in the mouth. My partner was a bit miffed by the fact that they had only one or two sauces out at the bar, but I generally prefer to eat BBQ based on its own merits. For sides, we opted for collards, beans, and a baked potato without the meat. The first two were meh, but the baked potato was a standout and I'd order it again. Our bartender commented that the baked potato with meat is a meal within itself, but even this one was pretty hefty with the (real!) cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and green onions. Yum. If there's room for dessert, I wouldn't skip out on the key lime pie, which has a fantastic graham cracker crust and that perfect combination of sweet and tart. Do they make these to go?"
11209,3345,3,1,10/28/2013,"I have very mixed feelings about Morgan's, following three very mixed experiences. The pork ribs are absolutely incredible, beautifully tender & wonderfully spiced, fall off the bone amazing! The fatty brisket is absolutely phenomenal, ever so delectable and indulgent. These are the best things I've had, far and beyond. I've been hoping to try the beef ribs, and even though we are continually told that they'll be offered ""definitely next week"" and ""most likely next week"" and ""probably next week"" -- we keep trusting them, since they're listed on the menu, and since it's best to give people the benefit of the doubt, so we keep coming back, but we have been continually disappointed, and I am becoming increasingly frustrated, over it. Also, they are constantly out of things, there's no this, there's no that, they really need to prepare better, and get their business in order. Thankfully, the beer selection is decent, and the key lime pie was an absolute knock-out. Lastly, the side dishes -- the cole slaw & collard greens & mac n' cheese & pinto beans are mediocre at best, utterly forgettable, the red chili is pretty good but way too salty, and the lone stand-out is the absolutely terrific potato salad."
11210,3345,1,1,10/27/2013,"After reading some reviews, we checked out Morgan's for Sunday brunch. To be blunt, boy were we sorry. ˜First off, as the server sat us and gave us menus, she proceeded to tell us what she was out of. For the 7 or so egg dishes, they were out of all but 1. ˜And to clarify, we were there at noon, they opened at 11 and we were one of the only tables there. The server then flipped over the menu to continue to tell us what they were out of. ˜We should have left right there. ˜She asked if we wanted drinks and offered Bloody Mary's or Mimosas. Neither were on the menu but since I find it hard to pass up a Bloody Mary I ordered one, my bf ordered a draft beer. Since options were limited we decided to each order sandwiches (I chose the pulled pork, bf ordered the sausage). According to the menu, we were each entitled to a side with sandwiches during lunch hours 11am-5pm. No where did the menu (in the restaurant or online) did it stipulate that sandwiches only come with sides M-F. After we ordered our food, drinks came. My Bloody was weak, both in alcohol and flavor, and was teeny. ˜Bfs beer was fine. ˜When meals came they were served on cheap deli rolls. We were disappointed as soon as the food was placed in front of us. ˜Neither of us was satisfied in the least. The collards were blah, the mac & cheese was ˜nothing special. In short, the food was mediocre at best. The sides were served in 4 oz cups, $6 for collards and $4 for mac & cheese. The shock came when the bill arrived and my bf said ""that was perhaps one of the most mediocre meals for $50."" I immediately asked to see the bill since $50 seemed way too much. ˜Each sandwich was $10.50 and the beer, according tot he menu was $6. When I looked at the itemized bill, the teeny Bloody was $9! Now, I'm in now way new to Brooklyn brunches. ˜I will pay $10 for a good Bloody in a pint glass. ˜But this was absurd. ˜Then, as I gazed down, I saw the sides added in separately. ˜I asked a server who said sides are only included M-F. ˜Thought I wanted to argue, the bf more wisely said our best show of dissatisfaction will be to never, ever eat at Morgan's again. ˜ With all of the amazing restaurants in Brooklyn, especially in Pros Heights and the Slope, and with BBQ spots being the new Fro-Yos popping up everywhere I'd encourage everyone to check out ANY of the other restaurants in the area. ˜Dinosaur BBQ is a favorite and I'm bummed we didn't just stick with what we know this morning."
11211,3345,4,1,10/26/2013,"Excellent service and quality food for a reasonable price. I really liked the decor here and I liked how laid back the atmosphere was. We ordered the El paso omlette, brisket tacos, roasted corn and the chili. The omlette was OK, wasn't a fan of the beans in it and the goat cheese was a bit overpowering, the side of brisket hash was delicious though. The brisket tacos were really good with nice and juicy brisket. my favorite part of the meal was the chili and roasted corn though. The corn was so good with the green onions and queso. The chili was not the typical chili with beans that I expected, lots of chunks of brisket in there and the soup was seasoned really well. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and it only came out to be $32. I would definitely come back again and try their ribs and fatty brisket and their other sides."
11212,3345,5,1,10/23/2013,"Tried Morgan's for the first time today. Absolutely. Delicious. Hands down the best barbecue I have had in New York City. We ate the pulled pork sandwich, Frito pie, baked potato with brisket and the collards. Just can't say enough how tasty and authentically Texas it all was. We have already made plans to come back this weekend with friends."
11213,3345,4,1,10/22/2013,"The food was really good- fatty brisket very flavorful and the ribs- soooo good. ˜Smoked the way they should be with a real texas dry rub. ˜ Lean, fall off the bone, tender- you don't feel gross after eating them like some places around here. ˜They actually reminded me exactly of the ribs I get when visiting the in-laws in texas. ˜Mac & cheese and slaw were good, collards were very vinegar-y but still good. ˜Sadly they were out of the green-bean casserole, which was disappointing (it was also only 6:00 at night and not yet full when we ordered). ˜Our server was super friendly and checked on us a lot, but the kitchen or someone forgot our mac & cheese and we had to ask for it. ˜It's a cute spot and had nice out-door seating, I would absolutely go back. ˜Maybe a little expensive for bbq, but not terrible."
11214,3345,4,1,10/19/2013,"We popped into Morgans after deciding not to wait 40 minutes for a seat at a place across the street and I'm glad we did. They were out of a few things on the menu which was a little annoying but I enjoyed what we ordered. ˜We shared 3/4lbs of fatty brisket, 16 oz of macaroni and cheese, 8 oz of Texas red chile, 8 oz of potato salad and some cornbread. The brisket was delicious! I'm not a big fan of lean brisket so I appreciated the juicy deliciousness of the fatty option. The mac and cheese and cornbread were okay, nothing to write home about, but the cornbread came in handy for scraping the chile container. That was some good chile. I very picky about potato salad so my friend ordered the smallest size, thinking that would be the one dish he didn't have to share. Turns out that was the wrong thing to do because it ended up being my favorite item of all and he barely got any of it. I've been talking about that potato salad ever since. My friend, a new transplant from the midwest, always asks if there are free refills on soft drinks when he orders his ginger ale. Usually, the answer is no, but at Morgans he heard, ""yes"" and was ecstatic. I'll definitely be back!"
11215,3345,5,1,10/18/2013,"Just celebrated a friend's birthday here, and the experience we had was so awesome ˜I had to post. ˜We had a big group of people, and they were exceptionally accomodating, we left ourselves at the owner's mercy as far as what to order for our group and we must have tried everything off the menu and it was all awesome. There was some magical queso-pork dip that was probably made by barbeque angels. The actual meat was PERFECT. every side, every bite of meat that we tried (and we had A LOT) was awesome. Now, the food, crazy good as it was, the small batch whiskey expertly crafted, as knock your socks off as that was is not why I decided to write a review. The people here are amazing. Our group was huge and we had decided to sit outside, the sky was in no way ominous but the possibility for rain existed. As that possibility turned into reality, we just couldnt tear ourselves away from our epic feast (this says EVERYTHING about the food!) the owner ran out and bought us some umbrellas to keep us (and our bbq dry)...every one who works at this place is just amazingly friendly, and passionate about their product. Sorry fette sau you are out. Morgan's is in. LOVE THIS PLACE!"
11216,3345,3,1,10/17/2013,"The food is amazing! Seriously, their meat is succulent and great and I love all the sides and will definitely come back here time and time again. But I really, really, REALLY hope they figure out their service. Of the three times I've been here, they've messed up my order every time. Today, the food came incredibly quickly but I had to ask for water three times before anyone at the table had anything to drink. Someone comes by every 10 minutes to ask how everything is, and the food is great, but the servers don't seem to talk with each other and all have different ideas of what food the restaurant has run out of (or even where you're supposed to order- someone told us to order from the Elbow Room window at one point). And there's a weird focus on upselling, which is not something I ever want to run into at a restaurant. I hope to increase my rating in a month or two, when they'll hopefully have figured out some kind of system to manage/train their servers."
11217,3345,4,1,10/15/2013,"Welcome to the hood! Quick, quality food with friendly staff. We got the brisket and pork ribs with collars greens and roasted beans sides. We also went rogue and ordered a tricked out Mac n cheese from Elbow Room. They are owned by the same people but the more fun offerings aren't on the menu. I'm pretty sure my BBQ obsessed beau will make me eat here weekly. Thank goodness for elastic ˜waistbands."
11218,3345,5,1,10/14/2013,"Couldn't be happier this restaurant came to Brooklyn AND brought another Elbow Room location with it.. ˜I get cravings for Mac more all the time, and if Barclays isn't open, I.can't.get.in. Sunday Funday brunch brought me into Morgans. ˜When I saw free bird chicken and waffles on the menu, it was love at first sight. I am talking buttermilk fried chicken so good it transports you out of Brooklyn to the deep south. Add a side of Mac and nothing had a chance on my plate. My friend got the breakfast burrito, thankfully, so I was allowed to sample that as well delish. Adding fresh salsa and avocado to brisket was genius . It will be hard to resist the fried chicken, but looking at other tables around me and reading other yelper reviews I am going to have to go for the pulled pork."
11219,3345,4,1,10/14/2013,"The decor is very nice and the foodcwas decent. ˜The highlight for me was the pork ribs which literally fell off the bone. ˜The baked sweet potato was good but the portion should have been more. ˜They just service half of a sweet potato with butter, brownsugar and sage. ˜The corn bread was very moist which I kinda disliked was hoping for southern skillet corn bread. ˜I advice every body to stay away from they singnarure cocktail the ""texas two step""....very weak. ˜It taste like watered down bourbon. ˜But other than that a nice spot....just need to improve on their drinks."
11220,3345,5,1,10/14/2013,"Tried some of the meats. Fatty brisket, pulled pork, and pork ribs. The brisket was too beefy, less smokey than others I've tried. Still good, but not the favorite. Pulled pork was amazing, and the pork ribs somehow topped it. Prices are pretty good for the area. I hope this place sticks around!"
11221,3345,2,1,10/13/2013,"I live pretty darn close to this restaurant and my two roommates and I didn't want to go far for dinner. One roommate is from Texas, the other from Kansas City so they've got some experience eating some quality BBQ food. Given that this was its opening night, I'm going to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the quality was really not that impressive. I ordered ribs but they were out so I got brisket instead and I didn't get much flavor from the meat. The sauces were too watery for my taste and I'm not a fan of vinegar based sauces. The potato salad was just okay and I wish the bread it came with was more like toast. Service was great and that's mainly why I'm giving the place 2 stars. For how much I paid, I wasn't satisfied with how much food I got. I spent around the same amount last night at Pork Slope and couldn't even finish my meal. Plus, it was delish. I'll probably give this place another chance as I see people are giving it 5 stars. But, I'm not necessarily rushing to go back."
11222,3345,5,1,10/12/2013,"My husband and I have been coming here every week since they opened. Not only is everyone super nice, but the food is solid! They just started brunch and I'm really excited to try a lot of the new items. We're serious about our BBQ so we're really happy they opened in our neighborhood. In response to some reviews below, they took a little time to find out how much food they needed and to get the staff running, which is why some people fielded those complaints, but it is by no means on a regular basis. They run very well and they have catered to our every need."
11223,3345,5,1,10/11/2013,"Went here last night with a friend, could not be more pleased. Ambiance is solid. The brisket was orgasmic, ˜there really isn't another word that would do it justice. Mac and cheese and collard greens were pretty good. Then came the pies. Yes three, for two people. They were that good. Prices were great. The bartenders, Kier and and Justin were fantastic, personable, and down to earth. This place was just perfect for what we were looking for. I almost do not want to write this review, in fear that it will become too crowded. I'll stop being selfish and press submit."
11224,3345,5,1,10/9/2013,"Upgrading this place from 3 to 5 stars now since my first visit last year. The fatty brisket is really great and the pork ribs and corn bread are very good too. The portions are not very big - that's the only downside. ------------------------- This place is still going through some serious growing pains so I would give it a bit of time to settle in (they're still knocking over chairs, spilling things and running out of major chunks of their menu early in the evening). Also some of the food (the dessert, corn bread, corn and beef sausage) wasn't great. That said, some of the BBQ was amazing... so 3 stars for now but this place has 5 star potential."
11225,3345,5,1,10/7/2013,"I've been watching foodie shows for years where people stand in line for barbecue at 9am and it runs out by noon. I've often thought about taking a barbecue tour of the US to have such experiences. Now that Morgans is in town, I don't have to go anywhere and I don't have to wait in line (yet) but I would.... I would stand in line at 9am for this barbecue. To be specific, the pork ribs. They are the best ribs that I've ever had in my life and they will be the best ribs that you will have in your life.The rest of the food is certainly good and a huge step up from the other so called barbecue joints in the area but the ribs are exceptional-moist, tender, perfectly seasoned and just plain unforgettable. In addition, the bartenders I've met so far are well informed, friendly and have good sales instincts without being pushy. You're lucky if Dina waits on you, she's a doll."
11226,3345,5,1,10/2/2013,"Very glad to see this place open up in the hood. Maybe a tad pricey but brisket is a standout. Pork ribs fell off the bone and liked the rub. Get the frito pie especially if you've never had one... Fritos bag busted open and filled with chili, cheese n sour cream. Forget dinosaur bbq's soulless slabs o meat, this place knows what's up"
11227,3345,5,1,10/2/2013,"Fantastic service is a huge plus. Just came back from a trip to Austin, TX where the wife and I waited for three hours to get in to Franklin's BBQ (supposedly the best BBQ on the globe). The BBQ here was VERY similar -- not as good, no -- but certainly close! ˜And there wasn't a three hour wait for it! Highly recommend this place, really enjoyed it and will be back."
11228,3345,3,1,9/29/2013,"Didn't have everything available on the menu, some food items were bland (Mac n chz) while others were very flavorful (brisket, pulled pork, cornbread), service was a little slow but food was super fast. Will probably return"
11229,3345,1,1,9/28/2013,"Despite the food being pretty good, ˜the service and management does not have it together and they are not ready to be open yet!"
11230,3345,5,1,9/28/2013,"2 Morgans went to Morgan's in Brooklyn last night for Texas style BBQ. ˜We has brisket and you choose fatty or lean...guess which Jr. picked? ˜I got pulled pork, then we added sides of green bean casserole, mac-n-cheese, coleslaw, jalape?o corn bread with pepper jelly, Frito pie (beef chili, sour cream on Fritos inside the Fritos bag, tequila for me and really perfect hand made sweetened ice tea for Jr....then for round 2 some ribs and then a key lime pie for dessert...voila. We talked to the owner, a young guy from Beaumont Texas with the last name Morgan, and he was pretty happy the place was packed after being open 3 weeks. ˜I'm super critical so I would give it an 8...could have been a 9 but my pulled pork was too fatty and the portion in the amazing Frito pie (pictured) was a bit light. ˜They are planning more Louisiana style stuff to like gumbo, crawfish ?touff?e and brunch soon. ˜It was marvelous!!! ˜I'll be back."
11231,3345,5,1,9/28/2013,"Best BBQ I've had in NY. Visited Friday night early with the kids. Sat outside on rather uncomfortable chairs and a small table but all was forgotten when the food came out. Everything hit the mark: brisket, ribs both delicious. Frito pie (which I couldn't see on the menu) was outstanding. Corn bread was good. Beans I probably wouldn't order again (but were fine). Not the cheapest (~$60) but when it's great I'm willing to pay a little more. Love the influx of BBQ to Park Slope and this is the best."
11232,3345,5,1,9/27/2013,"I went for the complimentary food during a tasting and was really impressed. Went back again once they got the liquor license and it was even better than I remembered. ˜I had the pulled pork (moist and delicious) and the brisket (also very good). ˜I haven't tried all the sides but my favorites so far are the collard greens (a bit spicy), coleslaw, and bean casserole. ˜The corn bread is also tasty. ˜The best BBQ that I've had in Brooklyn. The vibe is laid back and friendly. ˜The staff are all very friendly and hospitable."
11233,3345,3,1,9/27/2013,"Was excited to see a new BBQ place near my old apartment. Too bar it wasn't there while I was still living here. Went in with my old roommate and waited 10 minutes before anyone came up to seat us. After finally being seated, it was another 10 minutes before anyone brought over waters or menus. Finally we got to order. When the food finally came- our waitress disappeared again and we were forced to go up to the bar just to ask for napkins and plastic utensils. Once we saw our waitress across the restaurant I had to again get up to ask for real knives. Service aside, I will say the food was amazing. Well-priced and quite delicious. Unfortunately, I think I'll only be doing take-out from here on out."
11234,3345,5,1,9/27/2013,"Yum! Love me some Texas brisket. Fatty goodness all the way, and this place did not disappoint. Great juicy ribs, decent frito pie, good cornbread, meh green bean casserole (really lacked salt) and please give us a menu with some drinks on them! Overall, though, very, very happy to have this place in the neighborhood - we will definitely recommend and return."
11235,3345,3,1,9/27/2013,"When we first walked in, we didn't know where to sit because there was no staff available to help. ˜We then waited for someone to come. ˜They sat us in the back, right next to the loud speaker. ˜The music was so loud, we could barely hear each other talk. ˜Because Elbow Room and Morgans shared a kitchen, we thought that we could also order from that menu, but we couldn't. ˜I was hoping to order the pulled pork from the menu, but they were out. ˜We ended up ordering a sweet potato, collard greens, ribs, and briscuit. ˜The waitress said that this would be enough food for the right three of us. ˜Once we got the food and tried the collard greens, our mouths were on fire. ˜There wasn't much meat and all the food was put together on one tray, without any plates. ˜The meat had too much fat and it almost wasn't enough food. ˜I would not recommend going here."
11236,3345,4,1,9/24/2013,"Stopped in for quick dinner before a show. Everything our party of 5 had was delicious. I was not sure about trying pinto beans and collard greens, but they were great. We were all happy with this choice, and will definately go back."
11237,3345,5,1,9/23/2013,"I usually don't care for BBQ as a lot of places rely on the heavy gooey sauces to make it ""BBQ"" -- but this place really does smoke the meat overnight in the back, and the flavors confirm that! The brisket falls apart and has a great smoky flavor, the pulled pork as well, and the side dishes were terrific. The chili in something called ""Frito Pie"" is delicious - I would go there again just for the chili. The peach/blueberry cobbler seemed expensive at $8, ˜but it was large, it fed three people, delicious, and they obviously used fresh peaches and blueberries. This is a great addition to the neighborhood - there's no BBQ equivalent for miles. Truly, the smoky meat is terrific -- and their sauce - incredible. I also predict that they'll bottle and sell it, it is that good. Every dish had it's own flavor; it wasn't the same piece of meat, covered by different sauces. I recommend it heartily. Two $$ is perhaps correct, technically, but each dish is so tasty that a little goes a long way. Highly recommended!"
11238,3345,5,1,9/22/2013,"I believe we have a winner. People are gonna go on all day, but here is the breakdown: [BBQ Thing]: [Adjectives that describe BBQ Thing] || [Whether I happen to like it this way or not] [$ = Too expensive for what it is] Pulled Pork: Tender, salty, smoky, fatty || Yes Mac and Cheese: Creamy, wet || No Coleslaw: Tangy, crunchy || Yes Collard Greens: Spicy, salty, slightly bitter || Yes Corn Bread: Moist || Yes $ Frito Pie requires a special mention because I've never seen one outside of Texas before. This is also the best one I've ever had, but it is $6 for what is basically a little taste treat. BBQ Sauce sitting in jars at tables also deserves a special mention - it is the heart and soul of the place. It's thin, and heavy on tanginess (vinegar?), but it is absolutely delicious. I suspect they are making it in-house. I predict that before too long they will be charging for it, so definitely go and drink it directly out of the bottle while they still don't see that move coming."
11239,3345,4,1,9/21/2013,"It was a pleasure to be able to eat some really solid barbecue in Brooklyn without having to go to Williamsburg and wait on lines and sit in a barn and eat with hipsters. It was a little troubling to see how empty this place was on a Saturday afternoon, but all the better for me. We had the whole beautiful outdoor seating area to ourselves, which is great on a nice, sunny day. They have a great menu, with all of the staples you would expect from a respectable barbecue joint. They sell several different kinds of meat by the pound, as well as sandwiches, which come with a side during lunch time (11 AM - 5 PM) for a great deal. One of the differences here from a lot of the other places is that they have a huge menu of sides - they have all of the ones you normally see (baked beans, potato salad, collard greens, mac & cheese, etc.), as well as some very different ones, such as the Soft Tacos and the Stuffed Baked Potatoes (which you can stuff with brisket or pulled pork, which sounds amazing). We got the Lean Brisket ($20 per pound) and the Pork Ribs ($12 per pound). The brisket was pretty tasty, but still pretty fatty for lean, but the Ribs were really really great. So meaty and they completely fell off the bone. We also got the Pulled Pork Sandwich was not so great ($10.50). It felt like the guy pulling the pork got lazy and didn't pull it enough - it was more like large hunks of pork that were mostly bland. For the side with that we went with the Potato Salad, which was of the variety that is completely smothered in sauce, so a bit overwhelming. I also wanted to try the Mac & Cheese, until I realized that there is an Elbow Room walk-up window next door, so I got a huge tub of one of the specialty mac & cheeses from there for a delicious side (yelp.com/biz/elbow-room-?). It's a perfect location to be right next to a barbecue joint, though it must be cannibalizing their mac & cheese sales here. This is a really solid option if you want some good barbecue and can't deal with going to Williamsburg for most of the other great options, or the wait is too long at the closer location of Dinosaur BBQ. I will definitely be back to try some of the other meats and to try some of the pie for dessert."
11240,3345,3,1,9/17/2013,"Ok, I'm all for rules but sometime s they just make no sense. I've had the mac an cheese to go and really liked it. This time I wanted to sit and eat. Well you can only get one kind of the many types of Mac if you want to eat at the restaurant and you can't get it to go and sit and order drinks or other food. They had ˜only 3 or 4 of the 15 to 20 tables occupied and turned away customers who would spend additional money on drinks etc.. Sorry I just don't understand. Have you never seen one of the restaurant/bar rescue shows?"
11241,3345,3,1,9/14/2013,"so yeah, i know every body is waiting for their liquor licens to come through for a easy access, joyful viewing/drinking spot for flatbush ave. ˜now aside from all of that, i really enjoyed the food. ˜the pulled prok sandwich is delicious. ˜i should have expected the small to average portion size but i didnt. ˜ it isnt on the level of going to a fancy place and getting bit size portions for 30 bucks, but be careful if you havent eaten all day. ˜Mac and cheese was good and the bartender on that Wednesday night was very friendly. ˜ I will go back."
11242,3345,4,1,9/8/2013,"My girlfriend and I stopped by today during their soft-opening. Our server Jennifer was friendly and attentive, and the food was overall quite tasty. Specifically: - Brisket (you can get fatty or lean; we chose fatty). This was the highlight of the meal: juicy and well-seasoned (though it teeters on the edge of being too salty). - Pork ribs. These were good, but not nearly as good as the brisket. - Collards. Very tasty, but almost too spicy. - Mac 'n cheese. Good and creamy, but a little bland for my taste. - Cornbread. Delicious. - Sweet tea: Extremely sweet but still good. Overall, it was really good BBQ, and I will definitely be going back."
11243,2694,3,0,2/19/2014,The food is good BUT THE SERVICE CAN BE VERY RUDE! Called to place a to-go order on Sunday and was treated as if I was annoying the staff! I had no idea they were closing in a half hour and the woman who took my order made sure I knew that I was ordering too close to closing time. So sorry to bother you with my business! I did not leave with a good feeling.
11244,2694,4,0,10/2/2014,"I am a picky eater and I love breakfast ! I'm not a huge fan of IHOP or diners . I love to go to cugino for my fresh espresso or cappuccino and the pancakes are yummy. ˜They have a breakfast special for like $9 or $10 with eggs ( I get poached) pancakes or French toast and choice of meat. ˜You can also get a short stack for $5 and they are two big fluffy pancakes . I enjoy the blt on rye with garlic sauce and friendly staff. It's small so go early or be prepared to wait on a weekend. ( but it's worth it ) they have daily specials like tiramisu pancakes or chicken and waffles , bourbon bacon waffles ... If you are by Ewing defiantly try for breakfast or brunch."
11245,2694,4,0,5/4/2014,The staff and food are great! Parking in the lot next door can be a little messy but well worth it. This place has become my Sunday routine.
11246,2694,4,0,11/24/2013,"My favorite breakfast spot in the area. Friendly service, interesting specials, and good food. Cafe 72 has an inviting atmosphere and a mouthwatering menu that makes this place something more than your typical luncheonette. Stopped in this morning for breakfast. On a Sunday morning there was a short wait. Coffee set up by the door to warm up while you wait. I had a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with pork roll can't really go wrong but it was delicious. I opted for fruit instead of homefries and was pleasantly surprised to see just fresh bananas and strawberries - exactly what I wanted and much better than the usual fruit cup with canned citrus and grapes. Another notable breakfast item is the pumpkin waffles with cinnamon butter (a special). If you have a sweet tooth there are several pancake and waffles on the menu that will be right up your alley - always sound good but just too much for me in the morning! I've been coming here pretty regularly for the past year and there has only been one dish that disappointed - biscuits and gravy (a special). Nothing offensive, just bland. In short - this place is great. It's my go to place to bring visiting friends and family."
11247,2694,4,0,10/22/2013,I passed by and it looked good so I stopped in. Best random decision of 2013. I've been back so many times I can't focus on 1 good dish because everything I've ordered is good. It's also a great atmosphere and d?cor.
11248,2694,4,0,1/1/2012,Cafe 72 is bringing Trenton originals back! ˜The Italian Hot Dog can only be found Casino style at 72. The service is good and the staff friendly.
11249,2694,4,0,7/31/2011,"Its a small place, hidden behind a convenience store. ˜When I first visited after we moved to the area, I didn't have high expectations. ˜What a surprise to discover a great breakfast and lunch place less than two miles from our house. ˜Their breakfast burrito is one of my favorites, and I have fallen in love with their spin on the english muffin breakfast sandwich. ˜ Great burgers as well. ˜My only complaint is the occasional lag in coffee fills from the often overworked wait staff. ˜But otherwise, its become one of my favorite breakfast stops in the Trenton area."
11250,2694,5,0,9/29/2014,"I go to Cafe 72 multiple times a week. I enjoy both their stand-by menu items as well as their daily specials. I am especially fond of the selection of grilled cheeses. The breakfast options and lunch options are equally strong. Classic breakfasts like Eggs Benedict are expertly prepared. There are also exciting modern takes on classic breakfasts such as the Croissant French Toast (which is AMAZING) or the Fig Waffle with Blueberry Chutney and served with Cannoli Cream. As I said, the lunch options are also very strong. I've tried the burgers, sandwiches, soups, salads, and pretty much every category of food on the menu. I have never been disappointed by any item I've ordered thus far. I especially like the daily lunch specials. Occasionally they have a lamb burger, pork & mango bbq sandwich, or the chicken mango wrap. Recommended for all ages and all palettes."
11251,2694,5,0,6/2/2014,Was just here on Sun 06/01/2014 and it was delicious - I ordered the Spanish omelet and pineapple upside down pancakes....with cream cheese frosting (short stack) OMG so yummy and the omelet has chorizio which gives it such a authentic flavor...Service is always pleasant and upbeat... This is Ewing's best kept secret in my book. Always a good experience!
11252,2694,5,0,4/29/2014,"LOVE the food here. I have been back multiple times now to try something different and have yet to be disappointed by the food. One of the great things about this place is that they have daily specials that aren't on the regular menu, so you have a lot of options to choose from. I haven't tried anything off of the lunch menu yet, but my favorites from breakfast are the Tiramisu pancakes, anything Eggs Benedict, and cannoli french toast (to name a few) Everything is reasonably priced (usually $12 or less) and the portions will fill you up. Quality food for what you're paying! Like mentioned by someone else the restaurant is small and usually really busy in the mornings, but they make sure to get you seated pretty quickly. The staff is also friendly and not overbearing like some waiters can be. Only downsides for me is that there is no parking (you have to park at the 7-11 or somewhere else nearby) and it closes at 2:30 everyday. But overall worth the trip!"
11253,2694,5,0,4/6/2013,"Previously Nick's Caf? 72, this warm and friendly caf? is now owned by the same owners as Cugino's Italian Specialties in Pennimgton NJ. ˜The commitment to exceptional quality in food and service is evident in both places. ˜They have kept the American fare menu and added some unique items that cannot be found anywhere locally such as cajun shrimp and grits, biscuits & gravy, tiramisu pancakes and fig waffles! ˜The specials never cease to amaze as well. ˜Had a jumbo lump crab benedict with asparagus last week. ˜Highly recommended!"
11254,2694,5,0,1/13/2010,"Fast and friendly. Great for breakfast, lunch, and dinner (I was surprised at how good their dinner menu was, with a wide selection to choose from). The wait staff is very friendly, and the owner is often around for dinner to check in and make sure you are happy with your meal. My daughter loves their pancakes.... their omelets are also quite good (though lately the chef has been burning them slightly, so I've chosen other items from the menu instead). Nanny's chicken and vodka rig for dinner were among our favorites. A great local favorite."
11255,2694,5,0,12/31/2009,"First, ˜the location is next to the 7-11 at the traffic light with the Dunkin Donuts. ˜Bear Tavern Road where it becomes Grand. The food is excellent Italian. ˜The deserts are exceptional. ˜The Velvet cake was complimented by a baker who make them. ˜The staff and service is exceptional. ˜The specials are special, the chef has succeeded in bringing subtle flavors from the combination of food. ˜ The rule is buy the best and do the least to prepare. ˜Cafe 72 has mastered that rule. We understand they will have a joint venture with a local winery in 2010."
11256,2694,5,0,6/28/2008,"I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cafe 72 with friends and family. I felt immediately right at home the minute I walked through the doors. The new owners are very down to earth and super nice guys. It is a small, quaint place with seating for approximately 60 people. It is BYOB, so we started off relaxing with a nice bottle of wine. The staff was quick to assist and were there within minutes with a bucket to keep the bottle chilled. The food was phenominal!! We all ordered something different and sampled a little of each others. I had the italian chicken which was wonderful! The crab cake, chicken parm and italian meatloaf dishes are equally as good. My compliments to the chef!! I will definitely be a returning customer, but next time I would like to try breakfast as that is my favorite meal of the day. Hurry up, what are you waiting for??? This is the place to eat!!!"
11257,2694,5,1,1/9/2015,"Cafe 72 is one of the best breakfast spots in the area. It gets crowded, so come early! Friendly staff, STRONG coffee, fun menu, delicious EVERYTHING. My personal favorite is the glorious morning pancakes- whole wheat, carrots, nuts, get the maple syrup. Chocolate chip pancakes are awesome, too. The fruit looks like someone in the kitchen took the time to slice the bananas and strawberries- not a wet fruity mess that other diners scoop from a tub. The specials always look delicious and I spend most of my time here deciding what to order, and I have never been disappointed. COME HERE FOR BREAKFAST WHENEVER YOU CAN."
11258,2694,5,1,1/3/2015,"Cafe 72 has some of the best brunch food I've ever had! ˜The people who decided to open this little gem knew exactly what they were doing. The menu has many options while not overwhelming, the only problem is that seriously everything sounds amazing. ˜From what I've ordered, everything really is so delicious. You might end up waiting a little while on the weekends, however they have this cute little area in the front of the restaurant where you can sit and chat while having a cup of coffee that's provided outside. ˜The wait is so worth it! Recommendations: -Portabella tower -Lobster benedict -Cajun shrimp benedict -CHEESE GRITS if you have any dignity, you will order this. -Cannoli french toast The service is great, the cafe itself is super cute, and service is pretty good. ˜Will absolutely be returning! :)"
11259,2694,4,1,1/2/2015,"This place was a very nice find! The service was excellent, he wasn't over bearing but very friendly and attentive! I had the portobello tower, which was egg-cellent! ;) I was torn between that and many of the French toast options, I would suggest that they offer a French toast sampler as they all sounded well worth the calories. My boyfriend enjoyed his traditional eggs Benedict, which was exactly as he expected! Will come back!!"
11260,2694,5,1,12/23/2014,"Always delectable, friendly atmosphere, and great service! Highly recommend!!"
11261,2694,5,1,12/4/2014,"I wish I didn't live in south Jersey. I might just have to start flying out of Trenton more often so I have an excuse to come here. All of the food was delicious, fresh, quick, and the service was so friendly. No complaints. There was even a sweet little waiting area outside with space heaters and coffee for folks waiting for their table. Great atmosphere & hospitality!"
11262,2694,5,1,11/24/2014,Absolutely amazing!!!!!! We went back twice while we were visiting from Boston. One if the best breakfasts we have had in a very long time!!!!!
