5144,1,1,1,4/16/2014,Ordered pick up 2x this week. Both times food was burnt. Called only the second time to complain offered to give me more shitty food told them no thanks I don't even want to eat. Was asked if I wanted my $ back so I said sure. 3 ppl later a nasty woman aid in order to get my $ I needed to bring my good back. I already wasted my time and appetite and I have to go back to them? No thanks save your time and patience.
5145,1,1,1,2/21/2014,U have to be drunk to eat the food here They should be ashamed to serve this I came her with my pregnant wife and she stopped eating in fear of the safety of our un born child They give u paper plates to eat off of .....
5146,1,5,1,2/15/2014,Delicious Wings! Delicious Thin Pizza! Love this spot to pig out!
5147,1,2,1,12/28/2013,"This is more of a 2 1/2 star review. The sad thing is, I go here pretty frequently because I can walk here. If you want to drink Yuenglings or Bud light and watch baseball, hockey and football, go here. They have a lot of TVs and a projection screen where you can usually catch the Yankees or Devils. I don't care about football, but I assume you can watch the Giants here. I don't think people actually like the Jets. If you want to go to a bar and hang out and act like a civilized human being, eat something of sustenance, and not hang out with the Old Man Budweiser Crowd and Bayonne Police Department go somewhere else. Lot 13 is cool. Venice is cool. The food is not edible, except for the pizza. But Bayonne is land of pizza and there are other, better options. I don't love this bar. But it is the closest place to my apartment."
5148,1,1,1,5/25/2013,"I went there to grab something to eat. Mind you, I am not reviewing the bar area since I did not hang out there. I am only reviewing the dinning side. You walk in, and all you see is green everywhere: chairs, rug (that looks quite dirty) and wallpaper. With that being said, the ambience it is pretty horrible. I noticed that everyone walking in could qualify for medicare -- so if you are within that age group, maybe you will like this place. if you are in your 20-30s, just go somewhere else. We sit down and at this point, I am praying the food to be good. We ordered the wings which were ok, nothing special. My husband ordered a pizza which was good (I would actually consider ordering it for delivery). I got an antipasto salad. It was ok. Also the menu is extensive, pretty regular american cuisine menu. Seems like most people go there for the thin crust pizza. The service was not good, the waitress forgot about my salad, she tried to play it off but it was quite obvious. Never got a refill for my drink. Needless to say it was not a good experience overall. Maybe if they put a few dollars into fixing this place it would be worth something. As it currently stands I would stay away from it."
5149,1,3,1,12/24/2012,"This place used to be one of my favorite sports bars, to some extent it still is. I used to come here all the time, it is a great place to sit and watch sports , got good projectors , giants screens for the big games and good tenders. The bar par is absolutely amazing, although recently it seems like they are doing something different and it just isnt as good. But even with not being as good as it normally is , its still a great bar pie. ˜Thin crusted and well done for a bit of crispness. Yumm! That quality of your night here is kinda of hit or miss depending on the crowd. ˜Its seems like over the last few years there have been a lot more of your older sit in a corner and get nearly pass out drunk types. The types that either get alittle to chatty and friendly or try to hit on anything that movies by yelling at it. (Think what a typical shore guido would be 40 years from now) But if you get a good crowd its still a great time when people arent getting to belligerent . It gets pretty crowded for the football games so come early to grab a good spot. It makes for a nice Sunday , but if ˜its not a Thursday/Friday night or some sports event is going on the crowd gets weird. ˜Come on a weekend or a Friday night and your all set for a good time any other night is hit or miss. PS huge parking lot around back for easy parking."
5150,1,2,1,6/26/2012,Pizza use to be pretty good but the quality has gone to hell. ˜If you do decide to order from here and have it delivered make sure you do it in advance as it seems to always take them over an hour to get you your food even if it's being delivered only 15 block away. So expect your food to be stone cold....and I mean cold. ˜Think of eating food that was sitting on the table for 3 hours then eat it. ˜Very disappointing considering the food (albeit bar food) didn't ˜always lack this much in quality from there.
5151,1,4,1,7/21/2011,"This place has the best thin crust pizza, period. People rave about Pete and Elda's at the shore, and there are other places around the state with some decent thin crust pizza, but THIS is the real deal. As I understand it, it's the exact same pizza recipe that was used at EJ's in Bayonne back in the day. I went to EJ's A LOT as a kid growing up in Jersey City, and can confirm that it really is the exact same stuff. Perfectly cooked thin crust, lots of cheese and tasty sauce. It's thin crust pizza done right! Don't come here for fancy decor, prompt and professional service, or any bells and whistles. Go here for PIZZA. This is Bayonne, and this place represents Bayonne pretty accurately, in my eyes. It's the best representation of Bayonne thin crust pizza. Go to the place down the street if you don't want the super thin crust."
5152,1,1,1,6/24/2011,worst ˜pizza I ever had!
5153,1,4,1,2/22/2011,"It's a good place to watch a game, have a few beers, and apps. There is a decent menu. I'm a fan of the buffalo blasts and the Steak Murphy wrap. During the warmer months, there's a tiki bar."
5154,1,4,1,10/15/2010,"I love the big apple bar. ˜It is thier thin crusted pizza that keeps me coming back, its the best! ˜if u have a big appetite order two pies bc the crust is so thin u can see through it...LOL......i have never eaten a main course thiere but thier appetizers are awesome as well the fried raviolis and the fried mac and cheese bites.....delicious..... basically this place is good for appetizers a couple beers and of course pizza"
5155,1,1,1,5/4/2010,Zero stars. This place has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Terrible food and the clientele is straight out of The Hills Have Eyes.
5156,1,1,1,5/28/2007,"I like to support local businesses so when I kept seeing commercials for Big Apple, I thought it would be a good place to go and eat. This place is divided into two areas. The bar, which looks nice and very sporty, and the dining area, where my wife and I sat. This area looks like an old folks home. I have to say, this was the worst ""restaurant"" food I ever had in my life. It was as if they ran to to local grocery store, bought some frozen food, microwaved it and gave it to me. It was terrible! The salad was chunks of lettuce root and not very appealing. I will NEVER go back to this place and will tell anyone who asks about this place to avoid it like the plague. Is it possible to give a place negative stars?"
5157,2,2,0,5/27/2014,"VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I are regulars to the State Street location and usually very satisfied. ˜They are fast, reasonably priced and good. ˜But tonight we had one of the worst experiences ever. We ordered our usual, which is vegetable chimichangas with everything (meaning rice, black beans, guac and pico de gallo) hot sauce and sour cream and beef chimichangas with everything except no sour cream or hot sauce. Where it went wrong... my boyfriend eats no poultry, beef or pork..I eat almost anything except I HATE sour cream and like spice but not hot sauce. ˜We got 2 containers, one marked with a ""B"" and the other unmarked. The one marked with a ""B"" ˜was the vegetable and the unmarked was beef with no hot sauce or sour cream. Unfortunately, ˜for us the unmarked one had beef with hot sauce and sour cream and my boyfriend didn't realize until a few bites in that it had meat. He hasn't put red meat in his body in 25 yrs, so of course this made him sick. Upset, since now neither of us have dinner I called to rectify the problem. ˜The person who answered spoke very little english, so trying to explain the problem was an issue. I asked if there was anyone who spoke english and he put me on with someone. ˜This gentleman told me thats how I ordered it and kept responding with ""yeah?"" ...So, after a very frustrating few minutes and no offer to comp our meal, remake it right or offer us a comp on our next visit, I told him he just lost a once a week customer. WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!! They would've recieved a four star reveiw otherwise."
5158,2,3,0,8/7/2012,"We went to La Carreta for lunch but it was closed. So we went there again for dinner, and fortunately, after a long trudge, we finally sat around a table. The restaurant is located in a residential area, quiet and peaceful, with an obscure deep green signboard. It was not convenient to get there, and there were few customers in (to be more exact, zero before we entered). The environment had nothing special, in comparison with other Mexican restaurants. There were small decorations like a picture of a Mexican man. Not much use of bright colors, and the whole room and the furniture looked a little bit old. There were only four tables in it. I guess they possibly provide more delivery service. The kitchen is the main part of the restaurant, and they didn't seem very used to providing table service. We had to ask for silverware, and they only had paper napkins. There were three or four people working in the restaurant, most of time they were cooking food, except that one of them would run out if the customer had any need. We could see pictures of dishes on the wall, and they were extremely useful to foreigners like me and my roommates. The menu was a piece of paper, convenient and easy to understand. I took one, hoping to learn the complex names of Mexican dishes. Haha... It took about 15 minutes until all our dishes were served. Not fast, in my opinion. We had 5 people and we ordered: Chicken Burritos, Beef Burritos. Chicken Quesadillas, Enchiladas and Vegetarian Tacos. Burritos were in an American style, as one of my friends commented, but they tasted good. I found beans, cheese, cabbage and chicken in the fillings, and I liked them all. Quesadillas was soft, and had a strong taste of cheese. Another friend felt that the cheese was not Mexican - the orange color signaled it was likely cheddar cheese. Enchiladas were too sweet and not spicy enough. Vegetarian Tacos was full of vegetables and looked healthy. The flour tortillas served with the tacos did not taste extremely fresh. Maybe they were purchased and stored rather than made in the restaurant. We also ordered Mexico-made sodas. Different flavors, different colors, the right sweetness, made with real sugar, a nice change from normal soda menus. The price was relatively low, and the portion was big. We spent about $9 per person, including tips. I only managed to finish half of my burritos. In conclusion, though the meal was authentic as we expected, they tasted not bad and at least worth the money we paid. The environment and service were barely satisfactory."
5159,2,4,0,4/26/2014,For the price this place is solid. Cart food out of a restaurant. Cash only.
5160,2,5,0,10/23/2011,"best burritos in connecticut, love the cart by the yale hockey rink"
5161,2,5,0,9/22/2010,"This review is for the La Carreta cart up Prospect Street on Science Hill. I have passed the food carts there for years and have been wary of trying them. For my first one, I chose La Carreta because I was in the mood for a burrito, and the chicken burrito was to die for. He warms up the huge tortilla and piles on the ingredients, from tomatoes, cheese, a coleslaw/cabbage-kind of salad that is delicious, black beans, rice, chicken, sour cream, and such. The burrito was fresh and by far surpasses the quality of Moe's, the local chain Mexican eatery. The huge burrito was only $4.50 and well worth the money."
5162,2,5,0,8/2/2010,"this place is flippin amaaaaazing. the pork is the best- tender and juicy and abundant! the menu is simple and cheap, always prepared to perfection. so glad they are close, bc my la caretta addiction is strooooonnnnng! nom!"
5163,2,4,1,11/20/2014,"This is a review for the cart by the Med School. I love a good taco. Burrito...quesadilla....etcetera. This cart has, by far, the best tacos I've had in New Haven! For 6 dollars you get rice, beans, and three tacos (with toppings/fillings of your choice), sour cream and smoky chipoltle sauce. I crave these on the regular. Stop by the cart when you're in the area - you won't be disappointed."
5164,2,5,1,11/17/2014,Best tacos in New Haven.
5165,2,5,1,7/28/2014,Consistently good and fresh and actually pretty amazing considering the price. The veggie quesadillas are awesome--really anything with their sauteed mushrooms. ˜The ˜people working there are cool and very patient when you try out your pathetic Spanish when ordering and picking up. Their cart on the corner of Elm and Bway is great for lunch--fast and reliable.
5166,2,4,1,7/14/2014,"This review is specifically for their cart on Cedar St. outside of YNHH, which has been a standby of mine for the better part of a decade. Great veggie burritos, great chicken soft tacos, and if you ask politely, the lovely woman who prepares the food will make essentially any additions or substitutions you could possibly want. Even if you catch her later in the afternoon the food is still fresh and as good as always."
5167,2,5,1,7/11/2014,They have a food truck which serves super mexican food. They've ˜got seriously great food here. To make it even better their prices are on point!
5168,2,2,1,4/10/2014,"This is perhaps the worst Mexican food in all of New Haven. The meat is usually chewy and the prices are kinda high. Maybe I shouldn't compare them to the food trucks at Long Wharf but c'mon, 3 tacos for $7 is sort of pricey. That's $2.33 a taco. Sure they provide some rice and beans but it's a tiny portion and it's not very good. Plus, the simplest order usually takes a ridiculously long time to prepare. Taquerias like this place are suppose to be quick and painless. But every time I get take-out it seems like I caught them completely by surprise and they have to scramble 2,000 miles to Mexico to cook my food."
5169,2,2,1,1/22/2014,"I really don't understand the hype of the food at the State Street location... It's cool that they have cabbage in their burritos, but that's about it. I tried to ask for some chips/guacamole/ chips and they charged me 3$ for a handful of those thick crunchy round chips with a blob of ""guacamole"" that definitely had a bunch of sour cream filler in it- was not fresh at all. They didn't have any salsa @ all. The food wasn't horrible, but it didn't wow and the ingredients seemed pretty cheap. Maybe I'll try the cart since that seems what folks are raving about, but I don't think I'll need to head back to their State Street location."
5170,2,4,1,8/17/2013,"cabbage! no wilted, soggy lettuce here, just crunchy cabbage. cheap, huge and delicious. i only get the vegan stuffs but at night i see them cutting hunks of meat down for the next morn. all very fresh and everyone is always super nice."
5171,2,4,1,5/1/2013,"This place is the best Mexican in New Haven. The veggie tacos are flavorful and kinda healthy. Great rice and beans. And no it's not the place for romantic first date, but I like watching the Mexican soap opera on tv while waiting for my food."
5172,2,5,1,4/16/2013,"For cheap mexican, there's nothing better. ˜Enchiladas mole is fantastic. ˜Great service, poor atmosphere but well worth it! More selection than their carts."
5173,2,3,1,3/21/2013,"This review is for the food cart on York street near Yale. ˜For $5, you can get one HUGE burrito. ˜It does take away any hunger, as for taste, I've had better, to be honest. ˜Not that the burrito was bad, everything tasted fresh, but the flavor I expect from a Mexican cart was lacking. ˜The Mexican trucks down along Long Wharf seem to be much more authentic, but my only concern about them is the cleanliness."
5174,2,4,1,1/28/2013,"Loved the value of this over-stuffed burrito. ˜It filled me up for an even $6! ˜ The quality was excellentl! ˜Ordered a basic chicken burrito which was loaded with chicken, black beans (not refreid beans :)) whole grain rice (not white rice :)) cabbage, a little cheese and a bunch of other stuff. ˜The tortilla was fresh, chewy and warm. My only complaint is that I like a messy Burrito where all the sour cream and guac and pico comes squirting out with each bite and this item didn't have much of a sauce on it. The only thing that fell out of it was rice and beans. ˜ I am sure I could have asked for a side of the saucey stuff. Next time I will ask him to put extra into the burrito itself, but then he may not be able to fold the darn thing!!! Definitely recommend this place! ˜You won't be disappointed."
5175,2,5,1,5/2/2012,BEST. IN. NEW HAVEN. now i've been around the block. seen a few things. eaten a few burritos. lived in arizona for awhile and still la carreta knocks my socks off. dont believe me? try it. its delicious. its cheap. the only thing you got to lose is 6 bucks. cash only joint. barely speak english. exactly how it should be. PS. mexico coca cola. awwwwww yeahhhhhh
5176,2,4,1,4/22/2012,"Pretty good! Yes, the food here is cheap, but it is also good. My favorite is an order of the chicken tostadas with salsa verde. Another nice thing about this place is that the people who work there are pleasant and friendly. As a space, there is no ambience, so do not think of it as a restaurant where you will want to eat and then hang out with friends for a while. I think it is best for a quick casual meal or take out."
5177,2,5,1,2/11/2012,"Love this place. Prices are very reasonably and food is delicious. Our favorites are the enchiladas. For $6, including rice, beans, guacamole, and sour cream, you can't do better. Mostly take-out."
5178,2,1,1,8/10/2011,"I've been using Yelp to scout out places as I just moved to the New Haven ˜area. ˜On most places the reviews are spot on...not here. I got the enchiladas with the mole. ˜They were pretty awful. ˜The mole was ˜totally tasteless, which was better than the taste of the tortillas used. ˜The chicken was acceptably cooked, but the rice and beans just lacked flavor. ˜The place was totally empty when I got my food, and after eating it I can see why. ˜The place just lacked soul (and taste) in the food!"
5179,2,1,1,4/30/2011,"Really? ˜I can't believe that people give them good reviews! ˜Especially those of you that claim to be form Cali! ˜I have lived in CA too. ˜Their burritos aren't nearly as good the ones form the Tijuana taco cart! ˜I live across the street from La Caretta, so I have gotten take out, including their taco salad. ˜I can't imagine something unhealthier and less authentic. ˜The only reviews I understand here are the ones that say the price to amount of food ratio is good. ˜Their burritos ARE cheaper than Tijuana's. ˜The only people I know that eat here are the frugal male scientists that need to maximize their caloric intake to price ratio."
5180,2,5,1,1/22/2011,"I have not been to the restaurant yet, but they set up a cart at the Fair Haven Farmer's Market every Thursday during the summer and early Fall, and I so look forward to getting one of their delicious quesidillas. ˜The amount of very tasty food you get for five dollars is amazing--and they make it while you watch. I swear I am going to get to the restaurant this week; I miss those quesidillas!"
5181,2,5,1,1/3/2011,"This is by FAR the best Mexican food in the New Haven area. $6 gets you anything on the menu and it is delicious. The portions are HUGE and they are more than happy to make custom dishes if you have allergies or food restrictions. The lunch cart on York st is also amazing and you get the same dishes for $5! The veggie tacos are great and you get 3 with sides of rice and beans, and the burritos are huge."
5182,2,5,1,7/17/2010,"Let's kindly remember that I'm from California and therefore am an authority on Mexican food. Now that we've got that fact out of the way . . . I'm writing specifically for their food cart by YNHH, which was always my favorite cart. ˜Love their veggie burritos! ˜I don't know who was the first person to put this sort of shredded cabbage on a burrito, but yes please! The employees are really sweet, and quick, too!"
5183,2,4,1,11/14/2009,"Cabbage is the best addition to a burrito EVER. Sure, they may have studied the Roomba cart guys, but hey...its still awesome! And to add something that most people don't care about but means a lot to me...I forgot they are cash only and they let me owe them $5! Who does that anymore? Its so nice!"
5184,2,5,1,10/20/2009,"In all honesty i've never had a taco salad to compare... the burritos are doled out in large, ˜juicy, delicious portions that hold up well from lunch for a late night snack. i live in VA now and I swear I think about their cart food all the time. there's nothing down here like it... it's better than moe's and better than qdoba!"
5185,2,5,1,4/14/2009,"Best burritos in town! ˜Try, the enchiladas verdes! ˜This place is not a visit for the ambiance. ˜It's more like a taco stand. ˜But it's all about the food. ˜There is no guy playing guitar in your ear or watery salsa. ˜It's just plain old good Mexican food. ˜A rather small menu, but each item packs a punch."
5186,2,5,1,10/14/2008,"Love going in for take-out on State Street - for $6, you get an amazing amount of food and it's delicious. My personal favorite is the beef quesadilla - comes with rice, beans, mango salsa, guac, etc. The staff are all lovely, and their kids are there to entertain while you're waiting for your food. The other day, I discovered they have set up a cart across the street from the Roomba burrito cart. Stopped by for lunch and got the same thing for $5.00. Now that's a lunch bargain and you get so much more than you do at the Roomba cart. Loved it, was great."
5187,2,4,1,9/9/2008,"Best size-to-price ratio in a burrito in New Haven, hands-down without sacrificing quality. Bring tinfoil, 'cause you ain't finishing it."
5188,2,4,1,8/27/2008,"Fast, inexpensive, delicious, and authentic Mexican. ˜Runs circles around the crappy excuse for Mexican at Fresh Taco on Elm St. that may be fast and inexpensive, but is also un-delicious and inauthentic. ˜Fresh sauces and very good rices and beans. ˜Yum."
5189,2,4,1,5/17/2008,"La Carreta is better known for the carts down at the med school and up on Science Hill, but this mom n' pop business has grown and now they've set up shop on State Street. ˜Primarily a takeout place, there are a few tables. ˜My first visit to pick up my food was amusing to me b/c the owners' three sons were frolicking in the ""dining area"" and I had to keep picking them up from the counters and putting them back on solid ground so they didn't run the risk of cracking their skulls open. ˜I really like ""mole"" so I usually get the enchiladas, but I'm sure the other options, burritos, tacos, etc. won't disappoint."
5190,2780,5,1,12/14/2014,"Great sandwiches...this one puts subway and other chains to shame. Everything is super fresh , my personal favorite is their tuna melt. It delicious and melts in the mouth. One thing that is absolutely worth mentioning is the people who run the place. They are extremely friendly and hospitable, this makes you feel welcome and make sure you revisit. Highly recommend tuna melt, Reuben, chicken cutlet sandwich , jersey burger, veggie sub."
5191,2780,5,1,11/11/2014,"The menu is huge, and I've never had a bad sub here. Amazing customer service! Cheesesteaks are one of the best in jersey!"
5192,2780,5,1,10/11/2014,Place was empty so I didn't have high hopes for a good sub. Boy was I wrong!! ˜My son got 1/2 club sub and I got 1/2 meatball parm. The bread was fresh and the meatballs were like home cooking with delicious marinara sauce. The 1/2 subs were too big for either of us to finish. This place is highly recommended.
5193,2780,5,1,8/12/2014,I was hungry and discovered this place near my bank. Very clean and relaxing atmosphere inside and every employee was pleasant. I tried the buffalo chicken sub with jalape?os and it was awesome. Complete with chips and a drink it was $8. I'll be returning!
5194,2780,5,1,8/7/2014,"Great product, great service, courteous staff, clean environment. They obviously care a lot about their business. Oh, and the subs are great :)"
5195,2780,5,1,6/5/2014,"Ive known nick for many years, and now that he owns his own sub shop he did not dissapoint! Besides being very easy on my eyes, he took extreme care of making my very picky order and making it perfect. Brought home subs for my brother and his girlfriend and all 3 of us were beyond pleased with our food. Nick is a great guy, smells unbelivable, and will continue to recieve my business. Thanks hoagie nick!"
5196,4,1,0,10/3/2012,"Disappointed in their Thai food. ˜Ordered their Pad Thai chicken, which is a favorite Thai dish of mine. ˜It was hands down the worst Pad Thai I've ever had. ˜The dish was very bland and had more egg in it than chicken."
5197,4,1,0,1/28/2011,"Worst experience I ever had at a Japanese restaurant!. The waitress was rude and snippy. There were 4 of us- 3 ordered the all-you-can-eat and the 4th ordered another special (same price) that included an appetizer, entree and dessert. When the waitress started to bring over food she told the 4th person, ""Do NOT eat"" Okay I understand the whole concept of ""you can't share"" but come on really??? The person was embarrassed and so was I.The food came out at very odd times. For example, the 4th person got a steak 20 minutes before we got any roles. The waitress forgot to put in our role order and we only got 2 roles. When we asked about it she was very rude!!!! The whole experience was horrible. It wasn't a cheap bill either. They offered to take 15% off but I argued to take an all-you-can-eat price off because one person didn't get any sushi at all! I emailed them to say how upset I am (because I am an regular customer) and I didn't get any reply. ˜DON'T GO!!! Go to Kumo or Sushi X instead."
5198,4,1,0,11/13/2009,"Friday night ""all you can eat"" sushi sounds good right? Not. My wife's dinner never showed up. I was practically done with my sushi before they came out and apologized for the delay. We complained...so they offered a lousy 10% discount -- but only on her meal. Needless to say we got up and left. I had a decent piece of salmon sushi but greasy tempura. Tuna and white tuna was just average. We won't be back."
5199,4,2,0,5/26/2013,"chinese food is good ,but sushi ˜is un fresh."
5200,4,4,0,8/24/2014,"Love the food. Service is a little slow, but very friendly. I love the all you can eat but they often times forget to bring things you order, and if some people order off the menu while others have all you can eat it makes it difficult to eat at the same time."
5201,4,4,0,7/3/2014,"Call in advance for the hot pots. Here is very good for big group/social events or couples. I also order delivery to the New Haven areas on regular basis. The drivers/delivers are usually friendly. I've ordered from Formosa for all kinds of occasions. The only thing I haven't tried is their Sushi... After all, this is more of a Chinese restaurant (which is very good at it) than ""fusion"" or Sushi. Overall, very positive experience for all kinds of occasions--dine in (couples/big groups: hot pots or regular dishes), take out, or delivery for individuals or big caterings--here."
5202,4,4,0,11/17/2012,"Good food and service! I've been back a couple times and usually get the buffet. For a descent price, you can sample a variety of rolls, etc. I'm sure I'll be back!...."
5203,4,4,0,6/10/2012,"This is just one step away from being ""china-town worthy"". ˜Food is fantastic, and despite other reviews, our service was good too. ˜Don't expect fast service from the kitchen to the table though--it's just not that kind of place. ˜Ranks right up there with Lao Szechuan in Milford/Orange. ˜Very good."
5204,4,4,0,11/8/2011,"Amazing sushi, awesome steamed dumplings, green tea and really good service. Will recommend and go back again."
5205,4,4,0,2/4/2011,"Good sushi...real good value. All you eat is 20.00, which is a teriffic price. ˜Loved the Godzilla Roll..."
5206,4,4,0,1/16/2011,"Bought a Groupon for this place a while back and finally went around Christmas to use it. ˜What a good choice! ˜The food was solid, tasty and the service quick. ˜They have an all you can eat sushi (not Groupon-eligible) but 2 in our party had it and said it was second only to Sushi Palace in Hamden...quite a compliment."
5207,4,5,0,9/17/2014,"I tried this place yesterday thought it was different staff was friendly, helpful wish English was a little better so that I could better understand answers to my questions. ˜Food was fresh and menu is pretty good. ˜Service is quick."
5208,4,5,0,1/19/2014,i am admittedly not an asian food expert. ˜but i just love this place. ˜the food is so yummy.
5209,4,5,0,12/13/2013,Best food around. ˜I used to go there every couple of weeks. ˜Never had a bad meal.
5210,4,5,0,2/15/2013,Went there last night. Very impressed! I got the $21.95 all you can eat sushi. Comes quick and the hostess and the waitress are really personable! My new sushi restaurant.
5211,4,5,0,4/26/2012,My father lives in Taiwan so I grew up eating Taiwanese/Chinese food. ˜I find the quality and deliciousness of Formosa's food unsurpassed by any other Chinese restaurant in CT. ˜I often order takeout for easy dinner parties and all of my friends rave about it and make me feel like champion for very little effort.
5212,4,5,0,6/10/2008,"this restaraunt is AMAZING!!! The service is impecable. The entire staff is very friendly and knowledgable of the cuisine. I have yet to have a dish I did not like. Hands down the best asian restaraunt in New Haven county. They have something for everyone, from sushi to pasta to fish to meat. It is all there."
5166,4,3,1,12/30/2014,"Authentic? Not even close. But the all-you-can-eat sushi is a great deal and pretty tasty (as much so as you could reasonably expect for all-you-can-eat anything). The servers are friendly and on top of things, so you're never waiting too long for another round of food or beers. I've never left with a feeling other than the warm contentment, mild shame, and imminent food coma that comes from gorging on so much sushi."
5213,4,5,1,12/13/2014,"Haven't been here since 2011, but this is probably my favorite restaurant ever for providing authentic Sichuan food on (at least at the time) somewhat of a secret menu. My most memorable experience here was taking someone here fairly late at night in the pouring rain, having been on the road for what seemed like an hour or more, and ultimately having everyone agree that the food was totally worthwhile. Before and after that we visited quite often, and sometimes got free stuff like milk tea and ice cream. May have been fried ice cream once. Regardless of whether that was free, it was very, very good. There was this one lovely waitress I really liked. The Dry Saut?ed Sliced Fish Pot was incredible, robust and piquant and full of exotic spices. Sliced Fish with Soft Bean Curd was also excellent and oddly great when refrigerated. I liked the subtle sweetness of it, though the dish was obviously mostly spicy and savory. I keep ordering both of these things ˜in NYC and Boston, but it's never been nearly as good. My parents first had the Spicy Szechuan Sliced Tripe and the Sliced Beef Tendons here in 2008, and as with my experience with the fish dishes, they kept trying to replicate the experience elsewhere, but we ultimately realized our luck with these items had peaked here. It's too bad because I can't see myself ever being in the area again. Also had: Beef Wraps, Tea Smoked Duck, Cumin Lamb, Sauteed Zucchini, Chinese Style Kung Pao Chicken. All good, though not peak level."
5214,4,4,1,12/11/2014,"We've never been to the restaurant, so I can't comment on it. For delivery, these guys are pretty great. ˜Their delivery time is reasonable. ˜The food is a touch on the expensive side for chinese food, but the portions are generous so whatever. ˜The food is pretty good, especially for delivery, although not outstanding. ˜They don't have fortune cookies, which is a bit of a disappointment for my kids (ok, let's be honest, it's a disappointment for me) although they do send those little fried wonton cracker noodle things. ˜ We've ordered from these guys several times now, and they're our go-to for delivery chinese food."
5215,4,5,1,11/22/2014,Awesome restaurant in of all places North Haven CT! We took the All You Can Eat deal and were very impressed. The portions were plenty and the sushi was fresh and well presented. Will definitely go back and wish to try something off the very extensive regular menu.
5216,4,4,1,11/4/2014,"I like this place just because everything is fresh and this is really clean restaurant! A little funny crew works in there that makes me smile every time. Food is really good and sushi chef Mike makes the best rolls around. I wonder why is this place always so slow. Good work guys, keep it up!"
5217,4,5,1,9/15/2014,I've only ever gone to Formosa for the all-you-can-eat special. The sushi is the best around and they have great appetizers. It's a bit pricey so I usually make it a special occasion to go but it's more than worth what you get.
5218,4,3,1,9/8/2014,"I've only had sushi from here, it was okay. Definitely not the best all you can eat in the area, but for being a couple miles away from home it wasn't bad. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here, but if I was really craving sushi and didn't feel like going far, this would do. Their seaweed salad is gross, though."
5219,4,4,1,7/23/2014,"Amazing General Chicken, best I've ever had. Dumplings really good"
5220,4,4,1,7/11/2014,"Talking about great Taiwanese home-cooked meals!! ˜I went here with my husband for dinner after work a couple of weeks ago as this was recommended by a family member. The inside of a restaurant was very clean and represented more of a fine dining restaurant than a casual you're-typical-Chinese takeout. ˜The price did reflect that. We ordered from the family-style menu although that section seemed to be mis-categorized as Szichuan style dishes (I was confused and had to check with the waitress). ˜Again, the menu items were pricey but the food was delicious! ˜I thought it was nice of them to translate the menu items into English that sounds more appetizing than your typical Chinese menus and I think (and hoping) this will encourage those who are not familiar with the Taiwanese/Chinese cuisines to try them out. It was our first visit and the food hit the spot! One small complaint was there was only one waitress handling all the tables at the time with the help of the owner/manager (I presume the lady at the reception area was) every now and then so it took a while for things to come through for us, getting the bill etc. I will definitely recommend this place for anyone interesting in trying out authentic Taiwanese cuisine. ˜I will come back but only for special occasions."
5221,4,5,1,4/26/2014,"This place (aside from the sushi, etc.) is Taiwanese (Formosa is Taiwan's nickname), not Chinese. Granted, their cuisines are pretty close but you will find some differences. My wife is Taiwanese and was craving food from her home country so we made the trek from Glastonbury to check this place out. Totally worth it! Owners and majority of the waitstaff are legit Taiwanese and I let my wife order in Mandarin so everything was kind of a surprise and recommended by our waitress Jesse. Beef noodle soup, rainbow fish and tofu casserole, spicy shredded bamboo shoots and saut?ed bean stem. All freaking delicious. HIGHLY recommended. Guaranteed as good and authentic as your going to get in CT."
5222,4,2,1,2/17/2014,"I went to Formosa tonight with my family after hearing great things about the food and the all you can eat deal. ˜When we got there, there was one waiter and one hostess. ˜The waiter was running ragged while the hostess was more like a sloth. ˜It took at least 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and much longer for our food order. ˜After about an hour of just sitting there, our food finally came out. ˜It was decent but nothing extra special. ˜By this time we were so annoyed and tired of sitting there that we just wanted to leave. ˜They left the check off list for us to order our second round of all you can eat sushi but we didn't want to wait another hour for then next round. ˜The waiter was very apologetic and offered us free dessert but we decided against it. ˜It was a huge disappointment and waist of money because we did not eat enough sushi for what we paid. ˜The food may have been better if we were not so aggravated by the time we got it, but all in all they were understaffed, slow kitchen, decent food, and I would not be going there again."
5223,4,3,1,2/10/2014,This place was not what I expected. They are way over priced for the portions you get. The food is not that bad but not that good either. Would I go here again prob
5224,4,4,1,2/2/2014,"Formosa is probably the best restaurant for Chinese food in the New Haven area. I have not tried the sushi yet but the Chinese food is authentic. With that said, this place uses quite a bit of msg and their prices are on the higher end. My most recent trip was for hot pot. Its $21 dollars per person (not all you can eat but a decent amount of food). The ingredients are fresher than hot pot at Great Wall in New Haven."
5225,4,5,1,1/12/2014,"My favorite dish continues to be chili pepper tofu, but I have had takeout and eatin across a good variety of vegetarian dishes, and have never been disappointed. ˜Consistently good, versus occasionally great!"
5226,4,4,1,1/4/2014,"Formosa is one of the better Sushi places in the area. The food is always quality when I dine in. Over the years service has improved greatly. It used to take forever to get food but over the past couple of years they have been much more efficient. Take out/delivery is fast and is almost always as good as when I'm in the restaurant. The only down side is they tend to be a little more expensive then other sushi places in the area, but bottom line food is delicious and worth the extra few dollars."
5227,4,4,1,12/19/2013,Pretty good! All you can eat Sushi was fresh and got large pieces. Nice atmosphere. Will go again!
5228,4,3,1,11/25/2013,Got take out last night. Not as good as I thought. Chicken w broccoli was very over cooked and lacking in taste. Probably wouldn't ˜go back. Chicken fried rice was decent.
5229,4,4,1,10/31/2013,"Ordered delivery last night and was totally impressed with the quality and taste of the food. Fresh, flavorful and sizeable portions for a fair price and delivered quickly. Thanks yelpers for your reviews, helped me to find this gem. Chicken wonton soup with spinach is a must."
5230,4,3,1,9/17/2013,"Dan Dan noodles were really good....My husband had a spicy pork dish, but it was lacking spice as other reviewers have noted. The service was good. Will we return? Probably for take out. Those noodles were pretty good."
5231,4,5,1,7/10/2013,I don't know what Linda B. ˜Is talking about. ˜This place is still really good she must have caught them on an off night. ˜I go here quite frequently and the food is amazing. ˜The front desk host is very friendly and helpful and we always enjoy our time here. ˜I rarely use yelp but was browsing thorough my favorite resturants and was sad to see a negative review for this place so i had to speak up. ˜The flaming chicken and Bangkok tower are my two favorite dishes and they just brought back the original sushi chef (Mike) ˜so the sushi is amazing. ˜They usually have a bar tender on Friday and Saturday nights so that's a great option too. Amazing food and an amazing place. ˜Still five stars and going strong!!!
5232,4,1,1,5/28/2013,"I never write any reviews, but felt compelled to after today's experience to warn others of the decline in quality of the restaurant's food. ˜I've eaten here multiple times over the past 4 years and have always enjoyed their dishes such as the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, soups, and sushi rolls. ˜My family and I went today to celebrate my husband and mother's birthday and ordered the crispy whole fish, seafood nest, royal duck, Bangkok tower, and various soups (wonton, hot and sour, and miso). ˜My mom enjoyed her hot and sour soup, but the broth for the wonton and miso were way too salty. ˜Whereas the seafood nest had no flavor and the seafood (lobster tail, scallops, and shrimp) was overcooked and rubbery. ˜The royal duck was also overdone and tasted almost like jerky and the meat in the Bangkok tower had a burnt aftertaste. ˜Fortunately, the crispy fish was okay, but not as good as the one I've eaten there in the past. ˜The service was a bit spotty as well. ˜We asked to be served family style which they said of course to, but after bringing out the main dishes, the server took away all of our plates. ˜And upon being served our sushi roll, the server gave us only one pair of chopsticks and a single dipping dish to share between the 4 of us. ˜After we asked for more dipping dishes, the server proceeded to bring us only one large plate. ˜One of the previous reviews mention that the restaurant is under new management and it shows. ˜It's unfortunate, because this use to be such a good authentic Chinese restaurant."
5233,4,4,1,3/15/2013,Get take out for lunch all the time great sushi rolls and even better dinners. ˜Pricing is good and delivery is prompt.
5234,4,3,1,3/12/2013,Nice little place. My girlfriend and I arrived right before closing on a Friday night. Very skeptical from the start but this restaurant did the trick. We each had sushi and it was pretty decent. The service was rather mediocre however the hostess lady was extremely pleasant and even offered my gf a complimentary ice cream just as the restaurant was supposed to be closing. I think there's something to be said about friendly business like that. I'd love to give them 4 stars however the food just wasn't 4 star quality.
5235,4,2,1,11/16/2012,"Don't try anything ""fusion."" ˜It never tastes good and it's over-priced. ˜I'm told they have excellent Taiwanese dishes. ˜I don't know what qualifies as an excellent Taiwanese dish, so I won't comment there. The last time I came to Formosa, I had their all-you-can-eat sushi: very disappointing. ˜Nothing special about their sushi, and I found their menu rather limiting, especially compared to other All-You-Can-Eat sushi places, such as Sushi Palace or Sushi X. ˜Worse, they made us use the same slip of paper over and over again, telling us to just ""cross out"" our previous order. ˜This, of course, resulted in confusion for them and some of our orders never came out... or things we previously ordered but did not want a second time around would come. ˜Furthermore, it took forever for the dishes to come out. Don't come for the All-You-Can-Eat sushi or fusion dishes, but if my Taiwanese friends are right, come for their Taiwanese dishes."
5236,4,4,1,10/5/2012,I've been coming here with my family for years. ˜I've had some the best service on the weekdays. ˜Best for lunch-special style take-out and sushi deals.
5237,4,3,1,8/12/2012,I have eaten there a few times...usually pretty good. Ate there last week and they were really off their game...haven't been back since.
5238,4,5,1,7/14/2012,"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. We wanted something different, and reading reviews from other yelpers convinced us to give it a try. I am so glad we did! Waitstaff, atmosphere, food, service A+ all around. The menu has a tremendous offering filled with authentic szechan items and the regular Chinese fair we in America come to expect. Also a full sushi menu. We started with pot stickers and chicken won tons (from the szechuan appetizer list). I read other reviews that recommended them. The pot stickers were some of the best I've had, and the chicken won tons were awesome. The waitress actually asked me what made me decide to order them as they are only usually ordered by people who know what they are. She was thrilled we were going to try them. Won-ton soup and hot and sour soups were delicious. For entrees we had sesame chicken and the romeo and juliet (combo of general tsos chicken and shrimp). We were in shock when they came to the table. The portion size could feed an army! At first we thought the items were a little on the expensive side being 18-20$ each. That immediately changed after our meal was served. I probably have enough left over for two lunches! Don't let the location fool you. From the outside it looks like a hole in the wall. The neon lights were amusing. Inside it is anything but! Its a very nice atmosphere. I will definitely be going back in the near future to try new items. Next time we will try their sushi!"
5239,4,3,1,4/29/2012,"This pan-Asian fusion restaurant on somewhat desolate Middletown Avenue was unexpectedly good for me. ˜One look at the neon lights and I was expecting the worst, but a step into the door led to a relatively sophisticated decor and a decidedly Chinese (mostly Szechuan) inspired menu. Of course there is a sushi bar and some pan-Asian favorites on this mammoth menu, but one look at the specials -- and the fish in spicy bean sauce -- made up my mind to cut to the chase. I wasn't disappointed wish my selection. A whole, huge fresh fish was brought out steaming hot. I could not get enough of the heat and the flavor of this dish. The fish was perfectly tender and flaky. I'm glad I trusted my gut and went with the special; it was exactly that. My date had some sushi, a mango roll, which was also delicious. It was a unique take on a classic tuna roll with a healthy portion of tuna and avocado. The twist was thinly sliced mango atop the roll. The salty and sweet combination really sang once the sushi was dipped in soy sauce."
5240,4,4,1,4/25/2012,"I have eaten here a number of different times. I've dined in and have taken out. The food is consistently delicious. ˜However, make sure you go here when you have plenty of time because the service isn't that great. Everyone is always very friendly but they tend to forget about you."
5241,4,4,1,3/29/2012,"Another good asian restaurant in north haven. This is more an asian fusion and sushi restaurant than a chinese restaurant. Ive had the steak formosa, filet mignon covered in an amazing reduced wine sauce and Gorgonzola sauce. The portabella mushroom rolls and seafood wontons are also delicious. Im not a sushi eater but the ones i know say Formosa is one of the best places for sushi"
5242,4,1,1,3/24/2012,"First I want to say that the food was pretty good when we received half of what we ordered. It was the slow and inattentive service that my party received may have been because it was a Saturday and we were ordering the ""All you can eat sushi"" but I think that so matter what you order you should get at least quick service. Our evening began at 6pm when we were seating promptly and received our menu and drinks. We sent in our order and got our drinks. When our food came, we noticed that only half of it arrived. Our server came around and asked if we wanted anything else and we said we would like the rest of our order and that was the last time we saw our server for at least 30mins. We didn't even get a refill of water until our server came around with our original menu order and asked if there was anything else we needed. Again we circled and spoke to the server stating that we would like the things circled. As we waited for our server, several parties that had been seated after were getting more food, drinks, better service and were leaving while our table was just watched. Our server came back with one thing and then had to be reminded several more times just to get 2 of the 7 things that we ordered. We order fried calamari and when it came to our table it was cold a soggy. When we told our server just took it back and did not bring a new one. This whole ordeal took 2 hours and when we received our check the rate seemed to be inflated so we assumed that tip was included even though we did not think that the service that we were given. My friend left his tip on the table and we left. On our way to the car, a server (not our server) came outside looking for more tips from us. It was unbelievable that our evening was unnecessarily long, that we were leaving hungry and this restaurant wanted more money from us. I have never been someone to snub tip or be rude but I was shocked that they actually sent someone after us for more tip. As I understand it tip is suppose to be based on the quality of service you received and I think that we should have made them wait an extra 2 hours for their tip. My friends are frequent customers at this restaurant and were very excited to take me there and it was highly underwhelming and very disappointing. I would recommended it for takeout but if you are looking for all you can eat sushi ˜within a timely manner I would opt for a restaurant that cares about all the customers that come through their doors, not just the ones who order alcohol and full dinners."
