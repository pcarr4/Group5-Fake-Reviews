5044,0,1,0,11/16/2014,"Drinks were bad, the hot chocolate was watered down and the latte had a burnt taste to it. The food was also poor quality, but the service was the worst part, their cashier was very rude."
5045,0,1,0,9/8/2014,"This was the worst experience I've ever had a casual coffee/light fare place. ÿThe server disappeared for 20 minutes, just talking to his friend by the window as my girlfriend and I sat dumbfounded that this dude had the nerve to do that on the job. ÿWe're trying to make eye contact, but clearly getting paid to talk to his bud was more important to him. My girlfriend went up to the counter once the server disappeared into the back for another 5 minutes (what is this guy doing?) and asked if she should order food up there or something. ÿThe girl at the counter gives her a weird look and just says ""I'll get your server."" ÿWhen they arrive from the back, they look over at our table and have a laugh. ÿYeah, leaving us hanging for half-a-goddamn hour at a place with only two other customers is not funny - but in retrospect, your collective incompetence and false sense of entitlement certainly was. The food was okay. ÿFor a place called ""toast,"" I'd figured the bread would be better, but it was just cold Le Bus. ÿAdditionally, I'm 95% sure the ""andouille"" in my special was just a link of the pre-packaged offering from Trader Joe's cut into four pieces. ÿ$9 for unapologetic mediocrity will not be happening again. Avoid this place like the plague. ÿI almost didn't leave a tip, and honestly I shouldn't have. ÿI felt the buyer's remorse all day. ÿWhat a disgrace."
5046,0,3,0,10/6/2013,"This is located on the site of the old Spruce St. Video. ÿThe mild cofee is very good and the pastris are great. ÿAt times, the service is slow even when it is not busy and at other times some patrons receive a complimentary mimosa drink. ÿThe WIFI is good."
5047,0,5,0,11/30/2014,"I enjoyed coffee and breakfast twice at Toast during my recent visit to Philly. The first morning I enjoyed the Omelette du Jour which had a savory filling of roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, and wilted spinach. It was accompanied by a crisp small side salad of baby greens, tomato, and berries. The house dressing was light and complementary, not at all over powering. I just HAD to complement the chef. The barista recommended a pour over coffee and it did not disappoint. He prepared my cup with care and attention to time and form. I followed the pour over with a wonderful latte, again prepared very well. As I was leaving town, I decided to visit again for breakfast before my long trip ahead. This breakfast was a delicious Eggs Benedict combo that was perfectly done and complemented by mushrooms, roast tomato, and a generous helping of wilted greens. A rich cup of melted butter accompanied the dish and the sweet side salad again brought balance to my meal. This time the barista made me a perfect cup of French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It was balanced and bright, yet rich in flavor. I had to have a second cup to go! Cudos to the barista, chef, and friendly staff. Toast is definitely a place to visit, eat, and enjoy coffee prepared in a variety ways. Don't miss this one!"
5048,0,5,0,8/28/2014,"I love Toast! The food choices are fantastic - I love that they serve brunch all day, and their coffee is well brewed and prepared. I'm a fan of the large windows - it's the perfect location to sit and people watch for a little while. Nestled in Center City, Toast provides people like me who travel into the city for work a little haven to de-stress and kick back a little bit. The staff is wonderfully friendly and always eager to provide their own suggestions when you're not sure what to get. ÿNow that school is starting back up it also makes it the perfect environment to settle down and do some studying. I love the fact that they play Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's - and related Pandora stations - it really sets the mood to unwind or have casual conversation with some friends. Can't wait to go back!"
5049,0,5,0,7/16/2013,"The egg on an English muffin (their take on eggs Benedict) was fantastic. Service was quick and pleasant. They have multiple roasters providing their coffee and the barista knew how to make a good cup. They have a La Marzocco Strada for espresso and then you can choose between a Chemex, French Press, or Fetco for filter coffee. There was plenty of seating, it's well lot, and comfortable. Free wifi available. Good stuff."
5050,0,5,0,3/3/2013,wonderful relaxed vibe and fantastic homemade English muffins. best Earl Grey tea in Center City.....looking forward to the outdoor seating in the Spring. friendly and helpful staff are a delight!
5051,0,1,1,12/5/2014,"Extremely slow kitchen. I went with an hour to eat before my shift and told the server that information as well. I got canned fruit and an omelette over 45 minutes later. I boxed it and left. About 2 weeks later I was waiting for quick hem and asked for the fastest thing they could make, bagel and cream cheese was the answer. That took over 15 minutes. Don't come here with any time constraints."
5052,0,2,1,11/26/2014,"I really wanted to love toast. It's quaint and cozy, and it was a perfect place to hop on a call while on my layover in Philadelphia. I figured I'd get a latte and some food while there. The latte was upwards of $4 for a small. I also ordered a turkey sausage grilled cheese, which I believe was around $10. We sat down and availed ourselves to the free wifi (great perk) while waiting for our food, which came within 15 mins. I took a bite of my crunchy grilled cheese, which was basically the size of a wonder bread slice, and was immediately horrified. This is not a grilled cheese with turkey sausage; this is a fucking abomination. I spread the sandwich and there was ONE slice of cheese on it--it was so dry that it wasn't even gooey or sticky. Also, there was ONE turkey sausage link that was sliced in half and spread diagonally across the sandwich. I would say that approximately 70% of the sandwich was turkey-less. The server happened to be nearby so my boyfriend said something about how the grilled cheese had no cheese...and he happily took it back and made a new one, with more cheese and the same amount of turkey sausage. It was a nice gesture but honestly, it's highway robbery to serve that sandwich and charge $10 for it. At the very most that sandwich costs $2 to make...and I'm including the side of salad greens. Overall, toast needs to step up their game. A little less stingy with the cheese, Some small tweaks to the menu, and slightly more reasonable prices, and the place would be great."
5053,0,4,1,11/17/2014,"First brunch experience here in Philly (actually in my entire life), and oh man, I can see why now brunch is such a thing. My friends and I initially planned on Green Eggs Caf‚, but because we would have had to wait 45 minutes for a table, we came here instead. Not only did the waitress seat us quickly, but the place also provided a very toasty ambience. (No pun intended.) I ordered a plate of their special egg toast: two poached eggs served atop a homemade split English muffin, with smoked salmon and asaparagus on the side. (I opted out of the Hollandaise sauce.) O-M-G. While I didn't get that runny yolk porn experience, each bite was a delicious sensation of salty and savory. Also, that English muffin was on point - so chewy and carb-y. I definitely recommend this place for a nice brunch minus the the terribly long line."
5054,0,3,1,10/20/2014,"Coffee is great and I live close so it's convenient! I've been here a handful of times but only eaten there twice. Their homemade English muffins are delish! I had mine with some jam. I've also had their avocado toast. It's poached eggs on homemade bread and alfalfa sprouts with plenty of avocado on the side. It comes with a side salad as well. It's really good but heavy on the alfalfa sprouts, I took most of them off and it was just fine after that! Their setup is nice, but windows, plenty of seating and even a handful of plugs if you want to do some work, which I appreciate. Their service leaves something to be desired though. Weekdays they only have counter service, which is understandable because most people are there to work while they have coffee and probably don't want to be bothered but still, some attention would be nice. I had to find my own utensils etc and the girl at the counter completely forgot that I was the one that was waiting for food, after only a few minutes. I'm all for good customer service so that was a little disappointing but I will still go for coffee and pastries. For a neighborhood that has tons of coffee shops this one is pretty good!"
5055,0,5,1,10/13/2014,"My family and I found this hidden gem while we were looking for a place to park and get some breakfast after traveling all day. We loved everything! The space is cute. The food was amazing! The juice and coffee were nice and fresh! We were impressed with Alex, the guy who took our order at the counter, delivered our food to our table, he also cleared other tables and seem to keep the line at the counter moving pretty fast!!! He manage all of these different jobs very efficiently and with a smile and a great personality! When we are in the area again, we will be sure to visit again!!!"
5056,0,5,1,10/7/2014,So many great things to say about this place . They are open early!! That's the first draw if you need to get some work done before your day starts. They have great drinks and the food is really good too. Plenty of space sit with huge windows so you can look outside as you work. Perfect ambience with light music that is soothing and not distracting. The staff was incredibly friendly and responsive. Absolutely nothing to complain about I hope this place sticks around for a long time. Oh also they bring your food and drinks to you! So you can order and sit down and set up your work or chat with a friend without having to stand in a line (not that there would be a line because they are so quick).
5057,0,2,1,10/6/2014,".. I wanted to love this place... I stopped by for brunch as i found it while roaming. I was excited for the omelette of the day but did not receive it. The staff was friendly, the tea was good. The omelette was just not tasty. Not sure if it was lack of technique of cooking or lack of seasoning but the spinach tasted really bad. Food: 2/5 Service: 4/5 Location; 4/5 - Super cure place. Nice and chill"
5058,0,5,1,9/22/2014,"The coffee is just better hear than all of the options in the area, I now actually walk out of my way to just get my iced lattes here. The food is pretty darn tasty too."
5059,0,5,1,9/22/2014,Toast was very good for breakfast when you want something hearty but not to filling. There egg toast (pretty much eggs Benedict) is very good and they have it in many different forms. I had the egg toast with avocado and my wife had the one with salmon. I'm not a huge fish guy but she said it was very good.
5060,0,5,1,9/11/2014,"Great Location, Love the vibe, food and love the service, highly recommended!!!"
5061,0,4,1,9/10/2014,"Toast is a comfortable and artistic environment with good food and very affordable prices. You can spend under $5 on a home made English muffin and coffee or go for a larger plate for under $15. My chia tea was brewed on site instead of from a mix (hooray!) and exceptionally creamy. My truffled egg sandwich was just the right portion and had fresh salad on the side with strawberries. They have huge windows that flood the space with light. The decor is cosy meets sculptural with mismatched pillows and modern artistic lighting. Our check came delightfully attached to a giant clothespin. It was early when I went, so there was not a crowd, but the staff was friendly, and fast."
5062,0,5,1,9/8/2014,"I stopped into Toast on my way to work to use my pc ÿand decided to try ÿthe eggs benedict ÿas i was hungry and had some time to kill....What a surprise !This was by far the very best EB""'s ÿI've had in this city so far. They use real baked ÿham and have a wonderful salad rather than the usual home fries as the side.. ÿIve been back many times since then and have not been disappointed yet. ÿA+ ps - the ÿenglish muffins are home made too boot!"
5063,0,2,1,8/30/2014,"Toast is ok. My goat cheese, tomato and spinach omelet was actually pretty good and the coffee was pretty good too. I had the hummus plate and the hummus was pretty good. But it's kind of expensive and although it's pretty good it's not great. Which is the whole thing. It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it but it's just not exciting in any way. I was kind of pissed that they wouldn't make my kid a plain omelette though when clearly they are capable of doing so. Weird. Nice space."
5064,0,2,1,8/19/2014,Really didn't see any vegan items on the menu. Soy milk wasn't even listed as an option on the board. I got a decent soy cappuccino but I have had better. I don't need to go here again.
5065,0,5,1,8/5/2014,The Toast of town!
5066,0,2,1,8/4/2014,"NOISE! Good food, OK coffee, moderate price but much too noisy from a terrible heating/AC system to enjoy a peaceful meal."
5067,0,5,1,8/1/2014,"Fantastic time at Toast! The omelet of the day had spinach, goat cheese and Capri tomatoes--Yum! Spritzers were fab and the perfect quencher for a warm day. I also had a bowl of fresh fruit and unlike some caf‚s the fruit was FRESH! It hadn't been in the fridge dying an icy death but perfect strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and banana. My kids (3 x 13y + 1(24y) 1 gal pal (13y)) ate everything on their plates and want to return. Above all the service was wonderful!"
5068,0,4,1,7/30/2014,"I would give toast 3.5 stars, but it is not an option, so I'll round up to 4. ÿThe food is pretty good, although very basic. Their menu doesn't have tons of options. The place fills up quickly on weekends, but if you come here during a weekday afternoon you can study or get some work done. ÿI felt that their french toast tasted kind of plain and they didn't have scrambled eggs on the menu (at a brunch place?!?), but perhaps that has changed since the last time I went there. ÿI highly recommend their spritzers. They are yummy and refreshing on a hot day."
5069,0,4,1,7/23/2014,"Solid little tea selection here, plus they carry sip n' glo juices (they are expensive, but good)! ÿThe hours are very convenient, too (Monday to Friday 7-7 and Saturday/Sunday 8-6). ÿThe hummus wrap looked delightful, but sadly, I wasn't hungry enough when I stopped in. ÿI will definitely be back to try it and will update accordingly!"
5070,0,4,1,6/29/2014,"Toast has the potential to be amazing - the food was excellent as was the coffee, but the service is lacking. Came here with two of my friends for brunch on a Sunday. We were seated immediately and though our host wasn't friendly, he wasn't rude either. I'm a hostess though and he could've done A LOT better. Anyway, my friends ordered lattes and I ordered a double shot of espresso. It took 20 minutes to receive our coffee..For food, sure, 20 minutes is fast, but just to receive our drinks?! Did I miss something? It wasn't even crowded, so I have no idea why it took that long. If it were crowded, I'd understand a little more. When we did get our food and drinks, everything was good, so no complaints there! Friendlier wait-staff and better service would make this place 5-stars. Toast is cute and has great food, but don't be in a rush when you go!"
5071,0,1,1,5/20/2014,"AWFUL! Had half an hour to kill this a.m. so bypassed Capogiro to go here as had read good things about it. What a mistake!! First the girl working at the counter barely acknowledged me. When she did -made no eye contact, made me wait as was on the phone. When she finally waited on me whispered and was impossible to hear over the god awful fan racket coming from the kitchen. I then waited almost 10 mins to get my capp - I was the ONLY one waiting. ÿWhen i finally did get it was not very hot. The fan noise from the kitchen was deafening and the whole place reeked of old sandwiches and curry, I think. Couldn't leave fast enough. SO not the relaxing cup of coffee i was hoping for. When I left my clothes smelled of curry or something. It was just awful. Angry at myself for going out of my way for such an unpleasant experience. Only good thing was the croissant (which am sure came from elsewhere)."
5072,0,4,1,4/18/2014,"Finally got to try Toast after passing by many times. It didnt quite live up to my expectations hence the 4 star rating, but it was still nice! Came for brunch around noon and the place was almost full. The ambience is great - it has a clean yet rustic feel between the white floors/metallic light fixtures contrasting to the wooden tables/chairs. We got the hot chocolate and the blue lady black tea. The cups are quite big, hot choc was delicious not overly chocolatey and the was fruity and refreshing. We both got the ""egg toasts"" - avocado and truffled mushroom. I agree with another yelper that the avocado could have been fresher and the dishes could have used a little flavor (garlic, salt, onions etc) - adding a little hot sauce helped. My boyfriend's poached egg turned out to be a fully cooked egg which was dissapointing because we waited awhile for our order (5-10 minutes to get our drink order in and another 20 for our food). But the salad was surprisingly good - lightly dressed with a good balance of veggies and fruits. Our server was friendly and apologized for the wait a few times. Overall - the service was a bit slow and the food a bit bland (for my personal taste) but the staff were friendly and the ambience was great. Probably will come back for a drink sometime instead!!"
5073,0,5,1,4/9/2014,"I love this place for its coffeeshop feel without being a coffee shop. It's a great place to study with high ceilings and giant windows so it feels spacious without having that much square footage. Their internet is fast and they have a little bar for those of us who like to occasionally stand and study. While the service is a little slow, it's not ridiculous and most of the baristas are very friendly. I haven't had a negative experience here yet. The food is delicious. They have omelettes and toast related things, and soups along with their coffees and teas so I can literally be here all day as long as it's not too busy and never have to leave. I'm a fan of the veggie chili and their occasional wrap, but still have to try more off the menu."
5074,0,5,1,3/30/2014,"I think this is one of the cutest coffee shops ever. ÿVisiting for just a night and staying across the street and been here twice already. ÿI am from NY, so to some of the other comments, nothing is expensive compared. ÿWould definitely stop by."
5075,0,5,1,3/15/2014,"I've come here now a couple of times and I love this place. Coffee is good, service is quick and food is good. I got the lox Benedict before and it was delicious. Cute little place to go to on the weekends. We also didn't have much of a wait for coming on a Sunday which is kind of unheard of in Philly. I will definitely come back!"
5076,0,1,1,3/12/2014,"On Sunday, I ordered a soy caramel latte. They were out of caramel, and vanilla, so I settled on a mocha and paid. The employees then just realized they were out of soy milk. It happens, but the way they handled it... They were completely unphased and unapologetic. Just a refund and then a ""k cya"". I'm convinced customer service is dead in this city and my recent experience at Toast reaffirmed that."
5077,0,1,1,2/20/2014,"Toast, you're killing me. I've tried many times to like this place since I live so close to it, but its just one disappointment after another. The prices are just oddly absurd. I got a small coffee and a tiny muffin (about 1-2 inches in diameter) and it came out to almost $6! Not to mention the muffin had absolutely no flavor to it and was kind of stale. I hate to feel such regret after making a purchase but it's happened a few times at Toast now. They only get my business out of convenience when the weather is too gross to go somewhere farther."
5078,0,4,1,2/19/2014,"Excellent breakfast spot, with very good coffee, and of course, wonderful toast!"
5079,0,5,1,2/16/2014,"Toast is a shockingly good breakfast place. ÿTheir sandwich board outside always seems to be advertising tea or desserts, but breakfast or brunch is really where it's at. On the low end, they do restaurant-quality egg sandwiches at food truck prices. The rest of the menu is quite small, but I think it was designed by some sort of restaurant-managing genius, because every item I've tried is basically the best I've ever eaten. Wilted greens egg toast? ÿThe plate is beautifully and deliciously covered with greens and mushrooms, the homemade muffins are crispy and perfect, and the hollandaise is excellent. ÿHummus plate? ÿI didn't expect much, but it was actually amazing -- the highlight is their salted bagel chips, which are somehow both crunchy and chewy. ÿAnd I've never had a better yogurt parfait anywhere: the chewy honey granola is perfect, they use plain Pequea Valley yogurt which is already my favorite, and the thing is just loaded with berries."
5080,0,2,1,2/10/2014,"WTF SURLY BARISTA? ÿWhen I stumble in at 7am, I expect you to at least smile. ÿWhen I ask if you have green tea, don't be an ass and sigh and say ""only like FIVE"" and then not give me any advice. ÿI don't know shit about green tea! Also, your red eye last time stunk. BOOOO HISS."
5081,0,4,1,2/2/2014,"really awesome neighborhood cafe. staff is very friendly and helpful. my waiter put me in the best corner spot to do work for a few hours. coffee and food are pretty decent and so are their prices. i will be incorporating this spot into my brunch cycle. really love the soundtrack too--belle & sebastian, modest mouse, lots of shins."
5082,0,4,1,1/25/2014,"Overall, a good cappuccino. ÿStrong coffee flavor, with a smoky aftertaste. ÿI normally prefer a more creamy consistency, with a sour tinge at the end, but I didn't much mind the taste of Toast's cappuccino. ÿVerging on $4 territory, it's a pricey drink. ÿAlthough I didn't sample, the fold menu looked intriguing. ÿAlso, went on a cold day and the seating area was the opposite of toasty. ÿWorth the visit though."
5083,0,4,1,1/20/2014,"Came here for brunch and it was very good. Friendly staff, food arrived in a timely manner. I love how Toast supports the local art community by featuring work from local artists."
5084,0,4,1,1/16/2014,"Just moved into the neighborhood and I'm very happy to have this little cafe just a block away. The barista was friendly, the atmosphere quiet and relaxing and very inviting. The kitchen was closed tonight so I'll hold off that fifth star till I try the food, but this is definitely a spot you should visit. My cappuccino is delicious and artfully made."
5085,0,5,1,1/16/2014,"Wonderful. Just wonderful. I will walk, cycle, and train long distances for a well made cappuccino with a cozy place to sit and work. When they offer some sort of whole grain option for quick breakfast (bagels, oatmeal), all the better. When the staff is polite and sweet and courteous and skilled---I fall in love. Seriously happy about Toast. I'll enjoy coming here weekday mornings to write (it's so quiet during this time!). And it's just a short 2-block walk from the 12th/Locust PATCO speedline station (I live in Collingswood). Expertly crafted soymilk cappuccino and pumpernickel bagel was $5.50, plus $1.00 tip (baristas deserve tips, too!)."
5086,0,3,1,1/15/2014,"Nice vibes, just ok food and not too warm service. Good prices but not much food for it."
5087,0,5,1,1/9/2014,I. Love. Toast. My favorite Caf‚ to study in...also my favorite green tea and eggs benny toast.
5088,0,2,1,12/31/2013,"I've been in once. The coffee is fine. The hot line is a nice change from most of the Philly cafes, but I didn't like their basic egg sandwich---it was quite dry. Service was slow, but their was only one barista working. (At 9am on a weekday... ouch! I didn't envy him.)"
5089,0,4,1,12/12/2013,Great atmosphere and great coffee!
5090,0,1,1,12/8/2013,"this place upon walking in smelled like a pan of burnt bacon. it was overpowering. no exhaust? the staff was not so welcoming and seemed as though the couch area was their break room. eating, hanging out. there was even a mop bucket stored out in the open where customers could sit next to and eat by, if the couch wasn't taken up by employees that is. the cup of coffee was good. hours later my garments still smell like a 4 day old burnt cast iron skillet. blah."
5091,0,3,1,11/25/2013,Great food and drinks. Fresh salads and sandwiches with quality ingredients. Good service and atmosphere. Sometimes there is a wait because it is small.
5092,0,3,1,11/23/2013,"Great but expensive coffee. Their large is only a 16oz for $3. Not much variety with the to-go food. When you walk in, you don't know whether to seat yourself or have a hostess seat you. This is awkward if you don't want waiter service and are coming in for a quick bite or to catch up on some work. English muffins are amazing along with the homemade jam."
5093,0,5,1,11/21/2013,"Toast has expanded their ÿmenu offerings since my original review. The daily specials they've added make for more interesting options. I also like that the food is generally healthy, with right sized portions and fair prices to go with them. They've been able to make the most of the small kitchen space, earning themselves another star from me."
5094,0,5,1,11/12/2013,"This is a really nice place to get hot chocolate if you are near 12th and spruce. It's fast and convenient and affordable. I come here a lot since my brother apartment is close to it, it's the next building to it. So far I've tried their hot chocolate which nine times out of ten I would get instead of coffee, I've seen their food menu but haven't tried anything yet the only i tried was a small macaroon which is very good so airy and very tasty."
5095,0,2,1,11/9/2013,"Came for breakfast with a few people and service was lacking! Took a while for anyone to acknowledge us. Once seated, we waited so long that I got up and grabbed menus for my table. The waitress/host was nice enough, but too busy. Homemade English muffins are very dry!!! I ordered a breakfast sandwich with egg, cheese, and bacon. Bacon was good, but the whole sandwich was so dry. My friend received the wrong order and they said they could re-do it, but it would take 15 minutes. We already waited long enough for 4 breakfast sandwiches. Coffee and tea was good. Relaxed ambiance is nice. I would not return unless you have a lot of time to waste and like dry sandwiches."
5096,0,4,1,11/4/2013,"I'm giving these guys 4 stars, but really it's a 3.5. ÿAte brunch with my boyfriend yesterday and was overall super happy with everything, although there were some blips they could work out to be full 5-star material. ÿFirst, I was served my delicious hot coffee in a cute mug - with no milk or sugar or even a spoon. ÿI had to carefully carry the hot mug over to the milk/sugar station across the room (it is a small room, so that's good), and then hunt for a clean spoon since there were none available at the station. ÿIf you're serving sit-down brunch, your patrons should be able to remain sitting while prepping their coffee. The food was also really good, but also not consistently awesome across the board. ÿMy boyfriend had the smoked salmon with poached eggs and hollandaise on their homemade English muffins. ÿIt was amazing 0 the hollandaise was just the right amount of lemony and thin to feel refreshing, not gloopy and fatty. ÿHis English muffin was also tender and delicious. My dish, on the other hand, had a very hard English muffin, on which some slices of a less-than-good avocado were perched atop sprouts and then topped with poached eggs and a side of roasted tomatoes. ÿThe tomatoes were bomb and the eggs and sprouts were fine, but the avocado sucked. ÿThey even had the black strings in them - that's just not a good avocado. This whole dish would have been 10 times more delicious with pesto, so hopefully they read this and add it :) It seems like some of the staff were new and there's definitely potential to improve the little inconsistencies at Toast. ÿI'll definitely go back next time I'm in Philly."
5097,0,4,1,11/2/2013,"Toast has a really nice and relaxed ambiance. ÿI stopped in on the go with a friend and was impressed. They had a nice variety of teas and coffee. ÿI tried their chai tea latte, and it was delicious. ÿMy friend tried one of their more exciting tea blends, and she loved it. ÿWe also had bagels, which were a little pricey, but great for our on-the-go breakfast. ÿI'd love to come back for a more sit-down experience because I loved their space with lots of windows, comfortable-looking seats with pillows, and the open space."
5098,0,3,1,10/28/2013,"I found myself walking by Toast while I was in the area to do a photo shoot. ÿIt was a cold day and a corner coffee joint was just what I needed. ÿI liked the vibe as soon as I walked in. ÿIt has a good look, it was bustling with people drinking coffee and eating. ÿThe staff was friendly and the menu offered what I was looking for. ÿ While I waited for my coffee to be made, I grabbed a seat on the little sofa. ÿA great spot to relax, people watch and consume caffeine. ÿThe prices were totally fair, nothing crazy. ÿMy drink was good and served up with that added touch of Barista art. ÿI'd visit here again if I find myself in the area again."
5099,0,4,1,10/25/2013,"Not a big breakfast person but this place has changed my mind. Wasn't pleased with their coffee but had the poached eggs and smoked salmon and have decided breakfast is my new favorite meal after dessert. Hollandaise sauce? Perfection. Greens and fruits? Fresh and succulent. I never give my son juice because of added sugar, but at Toast, fresh squeeze ripe orange juice it is. ÿThe only reason this didn't get 5 from me was because the latte tasted watered down and the service was a bit snotty. But barring that, Toast it is for any brunch occasion... I wonder if they do take out..."
5100,0,5,1,10/20/2013,"I absolutely love Toast. ÿI live by a ton of coffee shops/brunch places and Toast is my favorite. ÿVery friendly staff, best cup of coffee in the area, and incredible bacon, egg, and cheese croissants. ÿA little on the pricey side, but you get what you pay for."
5101,0,4,1,10/2/2013,"I am sooo pleased to have Toast in my neighborhood. ÿAfter this space went from empty to restaurant to coffeeshop/restaurant to coffeeshop, it is time that a solid cafe took root. ÿThe decor is simple and airy, given the large glass windows facing 12th and Spruce Streets. ÿI love sitting in on the cushioned window seats lounging on the pillows as I pretend to work and really people watch. ÿThe space is ideal for study, brunch with friends or grab-and-go coffee. The coffee itself is quite tasty and they offer multiple varieties. ÿThey have seasonal drinks and now offer juices and smoothies. ÿYum! ÿHave a coffee and a juice and breakfast is complete. ÿBut if you want something more substantial, choose from their croissants, bagels, brownies or salads and sandwiches. ÿI personally like the hummus wrap which is full of nutrients and fresh flavors. ÿGood for morning or evening work sessions. Lastly, I have to comment that the owners and staff are so friendly and accommodating. ÿI always have pleasant chats with the baristas, and on my most recent visit noticed the cup holding everyone's loyalty cards (so you don't have to remember to bring it with you)! ÿBest neighborhood coffee spot!"
5102,0,4,1,9/28/2013,"This place has a different taste on breakfast and brunch, and I'm a fan. You won't find some of the basics: eggs your way, pancakes... you know what I mean. BUT! you will find a fresh perspective with a fresh ambience, fresh service, fresh food, and a fresh view of the street corner from any seat in the house. The quirky highlight - the toast theme. Toast takes eggs benedict to different level. It's not that dish smothered in hollandaise. Instead, there are seven varieties called ""egg toasts,"" all $10.50 or less. Still poached eggs sitting on top of english muffin (they're fresh baked on premise), but the toppings vary. We ordered the ""warm apples"" egg toast that came with baked apple, sausage, and white cheddar. Delicious, appropriate and ""responsible"" portion (read: not so big that you'll feel like junk after), and served with a side salad. Perfect size for E-money. I had the egg sandwich. Starts at $2.50 and then you pay extra for things like tomato, avocado, cheese, bacon/sausage, etc. Bacon ($1.75), avocado ($2), and smoked gouda ($1) were my choices with their delicious english muffin (couldn't tell you which cheeses are available - smoked gouda was the first i heard and i stopped our server there). Other ""toast"" choices include white, wheat, baguette, bagel, croissant. The sandwich didn't disappoint. Cheese wasn't melted, which let the taste of the smoked gouda really come through. Egg is fried. Add some ketchup and Tapatio hot sauce and you can't go wrong. Our side of turkey sausage was a-ok, but nothing to get excited about. Curious as to whether they make the sausage or bring it in. Coffee drinkers can expect a good cup of joe - E-money is super picky about coffee but she gave Toast's warm cup a ringing endorsement. If you prefer tea, like me, then you'll be pleased with the variety. I had ginger mint! Really enjoyed our breakfast at Toast. Showed up a little after 10am ÿon a Saturday and we didn't have to wait, a tough thing to come by these days with the brunch craze. I bought their dark chocolate, sea salt brownie when I paid for the bill up at the counter - looks awesome. Expect to see me back at Toast in a hurry - you should probably follow suit."
5103,0,4,1,9/11/2013,"Super convenient considering I live on top of the coffee shop! I love the coffee and free mimosa during the weekends for brunch. You heard me free mimosa!!! It doesn't get better than having a hearty but healthy breakfast with a mimosa. This place is still new so I would assume the brunch menu will continually evolve and become much more expansive over time. Right now you won't get the traditional brunch stuff like eggs and bacon or omelates but they do have a very interesting menu! Did I mention the free mimosa? I also like the vibe when this place goes back to its coffee shop roots, if I was a student I would most definitely hang out at toast and study and consume coffee!"
5104,0,3,1,7/23/2013,"Very cute coffee shop. Quick and nice service. A group of us were about to head out for some afternoon fun. Since Mother Nature is angry and is giving us heat waves, we ordered iced drinks. All were tasty and did the caffeine trick."
5105,0,4,1,7/22/2013,"Super-cute, very comfy, and everyone there has been nothing but friendly and helpful. ÿ The reason for the missing star is that things are a bit on the expensive side here. I probably wouldn't stop in for a coffee to go... but then if you're planning on camping out to use the wifi or read, it makes more sense to invest in a nice comfortable setting."
5106,0,4,1,7/7/2013,"Great decor and vibe. Secured wifi. Excellent freshly-queezed OJ. Fantastic eggs Benedict with lox and asparagus. Service could be friendlier. But overall it's still an excellent option for brunch or lunch. Too bad their air ventilation is poor: every time we went (i.e. dozens) after 45 minutes in the caf‚, our eyes would start itching. And after 60 mins we would have to leave, at which point we would both be smelling like we cooked in their kitchen for a couple of hours. So for this only reason, we've stopped going. Too bad."
5107,0,4,1,6/20/2013,Excellent coffee and nice sandwiches. Really good for a quick breakfast and relaxing cup of coffee.The bagels are really decent and I'm a New Yorker!
5108,0,1,1,6/13/2013,"Great idea, great menu, awful food. My sandwich had undercooked eggs...and a hair on it :("
5109,0,5,1,6/7/2013,"I won't rate the coffee itself since my company roasts some but they brew it right, they really know how to pull a great shot of espresso! The food is exemplary, and the service is always with a smile. Great shop, i always stop in when I am in the neighborhood."
5110,0,4,1,6/2/2013,"YOLO, I'm kind of glad you only live once, and I hope your successor does not also follow it's namesake, because Toast, I like you, and I don't want you to be toast. PROS For a studying spot this gets 5 stars: it's quiet, (aside from some pleasant background music), there are usually study spots near outlets, an abundance of pillows for comfort, reliable wifi, high ceilings, good people watching when you zone out, and last but not least... there is never anyone here (although this doesn't bode well for the future of the place, I selfishly love the emptiness). They take credit cards and I found their food reasonably priced (although I can't vouch for the quality). They actually have an extensive menu with salads and eggs benedict (around $10) as well as cheaper toast/bagel options. The one barrista is super sweet, the first time I came in when she was working, she was so friendly I had to stop and figure out if I knew her and she was actually a best friend I'd forgotten I had, or just super awesome. It was the latter. She also took pity on us and brought us water after we'd been miserably staring at our screens/books for a few hours. CONS Drinks are a bit overpriced (2.75 for a tea?) and they don't have a huge selection of teas. The AC was spotty last week, but they've resolved the issue I think. Highly recommend as a study spot, or a place for weekday/all day quiet breakfast/brunch/snack/solo dining. So let's raise a toast to Toast, and hope this one sticks."
5111,0,5,1,6/1/2013,"Stumbled upon this great cafe when looking for brunch one day. Great ""egg toasts"" - their version of eggs benedict, in a variety of ways. Excellent coffee and espresso beverages, and everyone is really friendly!"
5112,0,2,1,5/28/2013,"Went around noon on a Sunday during Memorial Day weekend, 2013. ÿSat outside. Ordered something that amounted to eggs benedict with mushrooms, with a side of turkey sausage, and french pressed coffee. ÿ Service was good - ÿattentive and friendly. ÿ Coffee came out first. ÿUnder brewed. ÿBrown in color. ÿPoached eggs were undercooked, barely. ÿEggs were atop what seemed like an english muffin, which was not toasted, and chewy :-P ÿ Turkey sausage, in silver dollar form, tasted funny. ÿEverything was tepid, except for the iced water. I didn't mention anything to service. ÿI don't think they asked. It's a nice space, and their coffee options are great. ÿI hope they get better at execution of food and drink."
5113,0,3,1,5/24/2013,"Decor is nice, and food and coffee are both decent. It's just not good enough to justify the prices, though."
5114,0,4,1,5/7/2013,"This place is new, and quaint. The coffee is superb, and well-made. Each cup is make from it's own grind and french press. Don't go here full, the food is equally good.. I got the poached eggs on toast (YUM). This location is near everything, and a short walk to Midtown Village or the Gayborhood for shopping after. Very cool vibe here, quick, friendly service. This place deserves your attention."
5115,0,3,1,5/2/2013,"I am absolutely enthusiastic about a cute coffee shop finally opening up in this space! The space is decent, its not too loud of overrun like other coffee shops in the area, and the staff is extremely nice and helpful! I am only giving it three stars, however, because it definitely has room for improvement. I understand that they just opened and are still working through their identity, but I think they could do a little more than just meals or coffee. I am a huge tea drinker and am unimpressed with their tea list. A good sweet non-caffeine tea is usually my favorite, and all of theirs fall short. They could use a few fun flavors like ginger, lemon, vanilla rooibos, etc. I also they should expand on their ""snack"" section too. I am not sure if this is something they want to do, however, if they want to be a weekday coffee shop, offering some little snacks like fruit, granola bars, nuts, perhaps even health smoothies could really go a long way for the student who doesn't want a full meal, but just a little something to hold them over. All that being said, their breakfasts are absolutely amazing and their coffee and espresso selections great. What they do, they do well, they could just benefit from a little growth."
5116,0,4,1,4/20/2013,"Finally a cafe in this spot that I like. Ever since Oddfellows closed down, I haven't set foot in the place. (For some reason I couldn't bring myself to frequent a restaurant called YOLO) I haven't tried the food yet, as I was just there to have coffee and study, but the ambience was friendly, the iced coffee tasty, and the server's British accent quite charming. See you soon, Toast!"
5117,0,5,1,4/9/2013,"It's not common for me to give out a 5-star review but Toast has earned it. ÿ They earn an easy 3 stars from the food and coffee. ÿIt tastes great, eggs and bacon done perfectly to order. ÿI feel like the prices are low enough that I don't feel guilty stopping in a few times a week. The fourth star is earned by having an unfussy but cute cafe seating area and free wifi. ÿThey don't mind me hanging out for a few hours on a weekday to get some work done while enjoying coffee and an egg sandwich. ÿWay better food and ambiance than chain coffee shops - this is a great place for a casual morning business meeting. We've been to visit for Sunday brunch too. ÿThey have a few extra people on and there's never been a wait. The fifth star is due to their wonderful customer service. ÿThe two girls that I see there almost all the time are welcoming and friendly. ÿAfter my first few visits, they recognize me and know what I'm going to order. ÿ I will definitely keep coming back to Toast, and I hope it fares better than YOLO and Odd Fellows."
5118,0,5,1,4/8/2013,Toast is such a cute place with a very cute name! I'm so happy this coffee shop on my block reopened...and they reopened for the better (formerly known as YOLO formerly known as Odd Fellows)! Everyone who works at Toast is so friendly and I love its bright atmosphere. Their coffee is strong and amazing. I'm a big fan of their Americanos and lattes.
5119,0,4,1,4/7/2013,"I really like this place a lot! Came for brunch with some friends from out of town. Green Eggs was packed and Valanni wasnt open yet...little did we know what a great time we would have at Toast! The staff was great and efficient. Even when we werent sure that we would be staying to eat, they happily sat us for just drink orders. We ended up deciding to stay and were all happy with our lattes and meals. I got poached eggs with vegetarian chili and avocado---yummmm. I loved the fresh side salad it came with. The only downer would be a $3 substitute charge for a ""large"" portion of side potatoes for my friend who didnt want a side salad. But other than that, it was a great experience. Nice ambiance and great people watching. Even though it is a smaller place, they didnt try to rush us out of our table. Much appreciated!"
5120,0,2,1,4/7/2013,Paid $7 for a bagel with lox to go. I got one tiny sliver of lox. And it took 15 minutes. What a complete joke.
5121,0,3,1,4/1/2013,"The cafe itself is pretty cute. It has a mix of chairs and comfy booth seats with some fancy pillows to dress it up. The staff were also friendly. When we were looking at the menu from outside, the prices for coffee seemed a little high, but my boyfriend and I decided to check it out anyway. We ordered drip coffee and it cost less than we expected, so I think we must have been looking at the price of french pressed coffee or one of the fancy variations....The coffee itself was a bit weak, but maybe it's just because I'm a fan of dark roasts, and this was a light one. I'm definitely willing to give it a second chance and maybe try some food next time because I saw other guests chowing down on some tasty-looking breakfast."
5122,0,3,1,3/30/2013,"Was quite excited about this new place, but have to say was rather disappointed. ÿThe service was lacklustre, like everything was a bit too much trouble. ÿAnd sadly the food, while beautifully presented, didn't live up to its promise. ÿThe place is selling itself on ""toast"", so really it should be serving perfectly toasted English muffins. ÿOurs weren't soft enough in the middle and were under toasted. ÿCoffee was fine but nothing to write home about. Overall, there was nothing offensive about the place. ÿIt was just underwhelming enough to not bother going back, in a city packed with great brunch places."
5123,0,4,1,3/27/2013,FInally a place where I can relax and enjoy the atmosphere without it costing a fortune. It is very clean and cozy. Staff is personable. Great place for a lazy day or informal date.
5124,0,1,1,3/21/2013,"I'm relatively new to PHL, however this place has changed name +/- management about 3-4 times so far. One would imagine that such abysmal business would learn as it attempts to reinvent itself. This new edition, or Toast, is clearly not doing well again, judging from its persistent lack of clientele. The other day I walked in, and hardly anything was done to the decor. It remains bland and unoriginal, despite the prime geo location. A mere Earl Grey cost more than any other CC caf‚ by an astonishing dollar! My surprise meant that I discussed the issue with my partner and we both wondered what the management of this place are thinking. Today, I decided to go into this place again, to give it another assessment. Like before, a mere couple of customers and a bored looking barista. The toll, $2.95 for a 16 oz coffee! Extortionate and the worst transaction of my AMEX in a long time. When you consider that a good coffee somewhere else in the Center City is around $1.75 you realise how absurd Toast is. Justification? Coffee beans grown in extraterrestrial soil fertilised by the manure produced by the last unicorn? Won't be returning here."
5125,0,5,1,3/14/2013,"I love this cafe. It's a fantastic place to study. There's wi-fi and outlets. Decent coffee and tea. I enjoy their chai, which is very creamy and slightly sweet. Great and comfortable environment. I love eggs benedict, so I can't wait to try their food one day. I love love LOVE this place!"
5126,0,4,1,3/9/2013,"I have been here three times for breakfast & love it. ÿThe poached eggs with sausage, cheddar cheese & dijonnaise is great! ÿOnly downside is it gets hot in there when it is sunny & they do not have shades to keep the sun out of your eyes."
5127,0,3,1,3/1/2013,"This place just opened down the street from me, so I was excited to finally have something in the otherwise vacant storefront as of a month ago. Toast is a nice place to stop in for a speciality coffee, latte, or espresso and they really know what they're doing there. However, when it comes to ordering their food such as breakfast sandwiches or egg toasts, they're pretty slow. So be prepared to wait. However, if you're having a lazy Saturday or Sunday with time to kill, have a seat in one of their pillowed booths and enjoy."
5128,0,4,1,2/26/2013,"First it was Odd Fellows and the only memorable quality was its name. Then it was YOLO (You Only Live Once) and it was just as bad and tasteless as its name. Now it's simply Toast. This time someone got it just right. That someone is V., who owns Chhaya on East Passyunk ÿavenue. V brings the same high qualityingredients and superb cooking ÿto Center City. With a distinctly uncomplicated flare you can choose from sandwiches, salads, pastries and a list of sides. You can mix and match or just stick with a classic ""bacon , egg and cheese"" and, voila, you're done. There's a fussiness to Center City dining that gets on my nerves. I hate it when a server can't pronounce menu items or when a foreign word or phrase is used when English would suffice. Toast chucks the fussiness for breakfast and lunch fare. This streamlined method is all I want when I am still slightly drunk from the night before and my stomach is on ""carb-cheese-MEAT"" mode. Great for ÿmorning and midday meals, toast is a win for Center City."
5129,0,5,1,2/21/2013,"Replacing YOLO Cafe, Toast has an eclectic blend of loose leaf teas & coffee, delicious ""egg toasts"" (poached eggs on top of homemade english muffins), sandwiches and other homemade goodies. *Try the egg toast with warm apples, white cheddar cheese, sausage and dijonnaise! AMAZING. I'm so impressed by their revamping of this place, the interior is cozy, clean and perfect for brunch with friends or studying on a Thursday afternoon. The baristas are helpful, friendly and warm. I will be coming here on a weekly basis. Cheers to Toast!"
5130,0,4,1,2/13/2013,"Great atmosphere, very clean and awesome coffee! We needed a place like this for our neighborhood! :)"
5131,0,2,1,2/12/2013,"There is good news and bad news. The good news, they do make a good cup of coffee. Now the bad. I was looking for a place to stop by and have a cup of coffee. First, I passed right by the place. It looked like a regular restaurant to me, but it isn't, it's a coffee shop. I was confused by a coffee shop called ""toast"". ÿAs to they really don't sell anything toasted. It looks like a typo, I think they meant to call it ""roast"". As that would have made sense. The places looks great, if they were selling Caribbean food. It looks very light and tropical looking ÿwith floor to ceiling windows. The menu was confusing. You need to be a wine expert to understand that the ""hint"" of a favor is a note. Meaning, not favored coffee. They had drawings of a french press and another one that I couldn't really know what it was. I guess you have to ask? On the counter they had laminated papers moving around all over the place with the real menu. All in all it's a very confusing place."
5132,1,1,0,4/17/2014,"well if that picture of mimi m.""pigging out "" above isn't enough to ruin your appetite the food will ÿ. it tastes like R&L ÿfrozen crap , when you change things be aware that a lot of people will notice ...the pizza is ok but used to be better , ÿ. the pizza is about the only thing edible. ÿ ÿmimi please no more pics while your eating ÿ!"
5133,1,1,0,7/23/2013,racist rock bar typical bayonne bar
5134,1,1,0,4/13/2013,This place is truly terrible ....as a boy growing up I enjoyed there food specially there buffalo wings now the food is just nasty.....maybe they hired a different cook or something but they need to invest in a new cook or something .....food was nowhere near as good as it use to be.
5135,1,1,0,3/18/2010,HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!! I tried taking my teenage daughter there last summer to celebrate her winning a cheerleading competetion. We were immediatly seated & told our server would be right with us.We waited almost 10min. & a (I assume) manager asked if we were ok. I told her we were dying of thirst! She asked us what we would like then walked to a server & told her what to get us. The server than walked towards us & was distracted by her friends at the bar. We waited another 5 min. before I was too frustrated (&hungry) to wait anymore. We got up & started to walk out when that same manager (I assume) rushed over to tell us our drinks would be right out. I told her no thank you & we will never be returning!
5136,1,2,0,5/20/2014,pizza is alright but the other food is pretty tough .
5137,1,4,0,9/22/2013,"Try the thin pizza, best around!"
5138,1,4,0,8/24/2013,"I love their thin pizza and thier grilled chicken salad - not to mention their french onion soup. ÿA really fun place, fresh food, and great entertainment."
5139,1,4,0,12/12/2012,"Just moved into area from Florida what a great find. Sports lounge, pool table, free WiFi, great bartender( Stacy ) just a short walk away from home Great!!!"
5140,1,4,0,5/11/2011,"This place is one of my favorite bars in New Jersey to go and have a drink. They always have a good beer selection and the bartenders are cool with you if they have seen you a few times and will take care of you. It's a great place to watch sporting events of any type, and it's got a really nice outdoor tiki lounge to chill out in the summer. The clientele is definitely colorful but that's what makes it fun. And unlike most other chill bars that I've been to, the food is really great, especially the pizza and the wings. Big thumbs up! I've spent many a fun night here."
5141,1,5,0,10/4/2010,"The bar side is great tvs everywhere, outsides a nice feature, food is amazing Specially after 3 drinks, this is the bar to be at in bayonne. Convenient, a nice pool table for a good time with your friends. Also the servers are on par, and if u go ask for chris. He""s an upcoming comedian. ÿAlso ask for kim she's hotttt. And of course your drink is never empty, what more would u want from a sports bar. I'd give them 10 stars."
5142,1,5,0,9/25/2010,"Probably the best pizza you will find in town. ÿIf you are going to the Big Apple, you have to try their famous thin crust Pizza, its the best around. ÿToni and Vin run a great Sports Bar and the restaurant next to it is equally well run. ÿThe service is always fast and the food is always served hot. ÿI have been there with my family several times and we always enjoy the big apple."
5143,1,4,1,5/11/2014,"I have only had takeout here. They make a great thin crisp pizza. It rivals Star Tavern in Orange. Toppings are abundant ,great eggplant"
